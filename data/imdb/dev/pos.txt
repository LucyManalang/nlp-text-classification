there are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious , political and societal means . not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights , as well as wage inequality , and marginalization in society , all in the name of allah or god or some other ridiculous justification , but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject . the setting is the 2006 match between iran and bahrain to qualify for the world cup . passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match . the women who were caught ( played by sima mobarak-shahi , shayesteh irani , ayda sadeqi , golnaz farmani , and mahnaz zabihi ) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and , most likely , all muslim countries . their interaction with the iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them , both city and villagers , and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules . it is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it 's women from the crude behavior of it 's men . rather than educating the male population , they deny privilege and rights to the women . seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of iranian society , it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in iran . but jafar panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it .
`` moonstruck '' is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller , norman jewison ( in the heat of the night , fiddler on the roof , the hurricane ) . the film is great on many levels . it shows a good slice of italian culture , has a touching romance , and ( best of all ) is a hilarious comedy . one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors . nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film , and cher ... well , cher always looks a little odd . overall , it 's a fun film , and easy to recommend . 7.4 out of 10
i think i truly love this film . `` prix de beaute '' was originally a silent film but later dubbed into french in 1930 . despite having someone else 's voice dubbed over hers , this remains a stunning tour de force for louis brooks . the fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary edith piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception . this is the story of lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend , andre ( georges charlia ) and their friend antonin ( augusto bandini ) . lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs : we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume . lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome andre . when lulu considers applying for the title of 'miss europe ' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of easy street . the film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women . we see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them . but at the center of it all is the magnificent louise brooks . if you do n't mind watching films from the bygone eras , then consider checking out this one . louise brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you 'll want to know more . also check her out in 'pandora 's box ' if you can find it . be wary of the us kino dvd release . i do n't know if their projection speed is correct . a lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed . this may have been the way they were shot . i do n't know . but since it 's the only way to see this film , it 's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill .
it was life-changing , it really was ! ! ! the man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to watch.the acting was fabulous , the story line was great , and this was a perfect start for reese witherspoon 's career.i do n't see how anyone could n't love this film.sure , it 's not the best movie ever , even though it was close to it , but it was highly amusing to watch , and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes , and a lot of other little laughs.of course , there was some cry your heart out moments too , but this movie was enlightening , and it brightens up your day , although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then.i ca n't believe this movie did n't win at least one award , and i also ca n't believe that it 's been seen by so little people on this site.see this movie if you have n't for it is definitely touching .
twisted desire ( 1996 ) was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart . melissa 's character , jennifer stanton , a seventeen-year-old seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents . the movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old jessica wiseman . jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents ! thomas was executed in 2000 ! jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old . evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother . jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia .
this is a great movie . some will disagree with me but , if you know anything about the bible you know it is . i think everyone should see it ! ! i agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on . if you can see this movie . is not a `` scare the hell of you movie '' , it is truthful with the bible . i think the u. n. will play a major role in the world government to come . the last days are lining up with the bible . look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped . it 's the size of a grain of rice . this i feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the bible . without the mark you ca n't sell or buy , with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it .
i once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide , and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so , needless to say , i can easily relate to polanski 's `` the tenant . '' but i also enjoy the film for other reasons . i 'm not sure that it works , on the whole - the polanski character 's descent into paranoia and madness , which takes up the final half hour or so , seems rather jarring and bizarre . ebert , for one , was totally unconvinced , and he slapped the movie with a vicious one-star review . but i think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully , so even though i do n't quite understand the whole film - what does egyptology have to do with it , for example ? - i still have an overall positive impression of it . i love the obnoxious friend portrayed by bernard fresson , for example . god , how many times have i settled for having stupid friends like that instead of no friends at all ! i love the movie theater scene - the funniest `` making out '' moment in the history of film , i 'd say . and boy , do i love isabelle adjani - she 's so foxy in this movie , it 's almost unbelievable . and she gives a great performance , as always . polanski is a good actor , too ; i do n't agree with the occasional disparaging remarks made about his performance here . his character is supposed to be low-key and thoughtful , so his low-key performance fits . i , for one , found him perfectly sympathetic - though he did lose me a bit when he started dressed in drag for no clearly discernible reason . yes , the movie 's obscure . and slow . but it captures the alienating qualities of apartment living - something i 've done entirely too much of - so i dig it . it 's funny how all you need is a common reference point , and suddenly a weirdo movie like this becomes deeply significant ! definitely worth picking up for pocket change on dvd .
eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand-up concert film i have ever seen . most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point , but not this one folks . for 90 min there is not one moment that is not side-splittingly funny . from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead-on impression of mr.t , the laughs are non-stop . sadly , this was done in 1983 , and eddie has n't done anything nearly as funny . it 's unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show , wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at all . eddie , if you 're out there , please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious . believe me your fans will love you for it . and i think you know that .
i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago , and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film . at the time , the only words that escaped my mouth were `` awesome . just awesome . '' i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that , but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so . the story is intriguing and thought provoking , and the acting is first rate from all the principals . this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he did n't have a hand in the writing credit for . back with universal after his long , arduous battle with them over `` brazil '' , terry had achieved what he wanted most ; the `` final cut '' . terry is a master craftsman , and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction . it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept . unfortunately , limitations still exist in such arrangements . the universal collector 's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing , although most of the bonus features are n't listed on the box . it contains among other things , a director/producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called `` the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys '' . it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking , including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly , striking the team with feelings of self-doubt and despair . fortunately , for all of us , they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success .
i really truly enjoyed this movie . ( which is why it surprised me that it got such a low rating from so many users at this site ! ) i am not saying that it is a cinematic masterpiece but it was a great way to spend a cold , snowy saturday night . it is funny , poignant , and a great tales of the ups and downs of female friendships lasting through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each others ! ( fess up ladies , we have all been there ! ) bill paterson shines as the reverand gerald marsden and andie mcdowell proves that she can be a fine actress when the role is right and she puts her mind to it . ( and truly , there is the best `` wedding escape '' that i have ever seen or dreamed up in this film ... more guts than anyone i have ever known ! ) you will laugh and you will cry -- - ignore any marketing campaigns and how this film is being marketing .... it is a hidden gem that should have done tonnes of box office . ( now i have to look around to purchase a copy ! )
`` good times , '' in my opinion , is a must-see cbs hit ! despite the fact that i 've never seen every episode , i still enjoy it . it 's hard to say which one is my favorite . also , i really love the theme song . if you ask me , even though i like everyone , it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run . everyone always gave a good performance , the production design was spectacular , the costumes were well-designed , and the writing was always very strong . in conclusion , even though it can be seen on tv land now , i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good .
as a 90 minute experience , it is not up to the standard of ` drive ' , as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the ` who am i ? ' academy , while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em-up . however , those who enjoyed ` drive ' , ( and i thought it was wonderful ! ) , will undoubtedly enjoy this too . you certainly wo n't rewind back to the start and watch it all again , but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come . it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced , even if not in hong kong , and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets , time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei . if you sit through the first half hour and are n't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat . bosch is magnificent , and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics , kicks and simple acts of bravery . if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy , then track it down and watch it . it 's not shakespeare . in fact , it 's less articulate than coolio in ` china strike force ' , but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - ( i 'm pretty sure there 's no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car ! ? ) .
there are some films that every horror fan owes himself ( or herself ) to see , and emilio miraglia 's `` la dama rossa uccide sette volte '' aka . `` the red queen kills seven times '' ( 1972 ) is definitely one of them . with gialli and gothic tales being my two favorite sub-genres in horror , i was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while , and even though my expectations were high , this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes . miraglia 's earlier giallo , `` the night evelyn came out of the grave '' ( 1971 ) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed giallo with gothic horror , but it could n't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite . `` the red queen kills seven times '' is , hands down , one of the most unique and overwhelming italian horror films ever made , and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it . an incredibly mesmerizing giallo with strong gothic elements , `` the red queen '' delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre : an inventive and incredibly compelling plot , spine-chilling suspense , a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere , eerily lush colors , stylish murders , a brilliant score , and , not least , a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful barbara bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror . the film starts out incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in germany . as little girls , kitty wildenbrück and her sister evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting : legend has it that a fiendish red lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people . fourteen years later , kitty ( barbara bouchet ) has become a successful fashion photographer . suddenly , people begin to get murdered ... director miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style , atmosphere and colorful creepiness with `` the night evelyn came out of the grave '' and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem . `` the red queen kills seven times '' is a feast for the eyes indeed , and one of the most overwhelming italian horror films both visually and plot-wise . the haunting painting in the grandfather 's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps . the red lady ( or red queen , as she is called in the english title ) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a giallo , the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own . a sexy female cast is always appreciated , especially in a giallo , and this one is a prime example for that . the ravishing barbara bouchet ( one of my favorite actresses ) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen , and she is a great actress too . bouchet 's presence has graded up many italian flicks , among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest cult-masterpieces of italian 70s cinema within one year ( 1972 ) : fernando di leo 's `` milano calibro 9 '' , lucio fulci 's giallo-highlight `` do n't torture a duckling '' and this unforgettable gem . apart from the wonderful miss bouchet , the film 's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young sybil danning , marina malfatti ( `` the night evelyn came out of the grave '' ) , and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera . as the whole film , the murders are stylish and extremely elegant , yet frightening and macabre , and some of them are quite gory . bruno nicolai 's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets , and makes the film 's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting . the plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings , the tension-level increses with each passing minute . `` the red queen ... '' begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second . overall , this is one of the films that i can not find enough words of praise for . `` the red queen kills seven times '' is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest gialli ever made , and a top-priority for every fan of horror and/or italian cinema to see . 10/10
a surprisingly effective thriller , this . david duchovny and michelle 'ensign ro ' forbes are a successful , professional couple , he a writer , she a photographer . forbes is desperate to move to california and , in an act of compromise , mulder agrees to the move on the condition that , along the way , they visit sites of historical interest concerning famous serial killers . his idea : he writes the words , she takes the pictures , with the end result a bestselling coffee table book that will set them up for life . to help finance the trip , they decide to car share and advertise the fact . as their bad luck would have it brad pitt sees the advert and , shortly after killing his landlord , he and his girlfriend , juliette lewis , meet the writer couple and begin their cross country trek . inevitably , mischief ensues . pitt is outstanding as the genuinely chill inspiring early grayce and is capably backed up by lewis playing her customary white trash character that seems to be her default setting . duchovny and forbes make for a convincing double act too and , as events spiral out of control , you as the viewer are sucked into their plight and can feel the tension ratcheting . intelligent , sinister and beautifully shot , this deserves recognition beyond its current status . a top movie .
a few years ago , i bought several $ 1 dvd 's that contained two movies each . one of them had three broadway girls ( an alternate title for the greeks had a word for them ) and this one , happy go lovely . it 's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaire 's limousine . vera-ellen is that dancer and-wow , what legs ! ceasar romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she 's dating the millionaire whose car i just mentioned . and david niven is that rich guy who , when looking for vera-ellen , is mistaken for a reporter who 's supposed to interview her but gets stalled by romero . what i 've just mentioned may be confusing but ( mostly ) makes sense if you 're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite ms. vera-ellen . romero can be a bit frantic here but niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout . the print i saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it 's in public domain . and vera-ellen does pretty well with her lines since she 's not really an actress . so on that note , i highly recommend happy go lovely for movie buffs who love old-fashioned musical comedies .
i saw only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90 's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts via netflix ( convenient service by the way ) . all in all , i liked this lighthearted , sometimes genre challenged , mini series . the story of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine . yes , it does have some romance clichés of running in the rain or a train station goodbye , but the characters have a chance to be explored so it does n't seem cheesy , like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar . robson greene , who at times reminds me of a separated-at-birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare . personally , i think the series could have been done with two episodes , but that 's up for debate i suppose . apparently , there 's a sequel , and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix .
the shining starts with jack torrance ( jack nicholson ) driving to an isolated hotel named the 'overlook ' situated high in the colorado mountains for an interview with it 's manager stuart ullman ( barry nelson ) about becoming the winter caretaker . ullman tells jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh winter sets in . together with his wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) & young son danny ( danny lloyd ) jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine , it 's a beautiful hotel , absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal . however the overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & danny has the ability to 'shine ' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things 'ordinary ' people ca n't . as the days , weeks & months begin to pass jack become more & more insane , danny keeps 'seeing ' things & people while wendy becomes frantic as she does n't have a clue what 's happening to her family , as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped jack finally loses it ... this english production was co-written , co-produced & directed by stanley kubrick & is a fine horror film . it appears that the shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one i will be commenting on is the shorter european cut that runs just under 2 hours in length . the script by kubrick & diane johnson , is based on the novel by stephen king which i have not read so i ca n't compare them , goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film . there are very few character 's in the shining with jack , wendy & danny the only ones that really matter , since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them , become involved with them & what they go through . the pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that did n't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout . on the negative side i do n't think the reasoning behind jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me , the fact that jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & i do n't know if i missed something but that ending did n't make any sense to me whatsoever , i 'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about ! there is very little in the way of violence or gore , a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but the shining is a horror film that does n't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story . with a budget of about $ 19,000,000 the shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as kubrick , the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character 's around the maze of corridors , the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners , basements & cobwebs kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors , massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor ( well 80 's modern , just check that red toilet out ! ) . the acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & nicholson seems crazy from the very start . the shining is an absorbing film that i enjoyed watching although i 'm not sure i 'd watch it again anytime soon . for those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed , for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story i definitely think the shining is for you , well worth a watch in my humble opinion .
anyone new to the incredibly prolific takashi miike 's work might want to think twice about making this startling film their first experience of this truly maverick director . in keeping with miike 's working practice of taking any work that comes his way and then grafting his own sensibilities onto the script , this is at heart a fairly basic yakuza thriller , with a morally ambiguous cop chasing a gang which his lawyer brother has fallen in with . what takes the movie out of the realms of the same-old same-old however , is the utterly unflinching attitude so some of the most sudden and horrific violence seen in today 's cinema . and this is n't that nice cool , clean violence so beloved of us cinema - this stuff is nasty , painful and hurts ! that said , the pace is breakneck , the characters are unusual without being just being burdened with stock eccentricities , miike 's sense of humour reveals itself and the most unexpected moments , and his camera is never quite where you expect it to be , making it hard to look away from the screen , whatever he might be showing you ! it does n't have the `` ohmigod '' ending of `` dead or alive , '' but if you 're not squeamish , now 's the time to get on board the miike bandwagon before he ends up on some hollywood studio 's `` new john woo '' shopping list ...
the movie looked like a walk-through for `` immoral study '' . most likely i never got much involved with the burning need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about `` now , who drew this penis ? ! '' sounded a bit gratuitous . dialogues in this movie are rather dreadful , albeit visually this movie got its moments . i almost dig it when tassi got into painting a mental picture but then movie weered back onto penises . highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while .
i watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away . it is a real masterpiece of art and i do n't understand why most of the people think it 's garbage . the main idea of the movie - take your ego away and then you will have true power ! this was the main battle at the end of the movie and guy ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way . `` the greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look '' - do you remember this from the movie ? because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... that voice that always tells us that we are important , that gives us our pride , that tells us not to give , but only to take , that creates our aggression , that wants to be in control , that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts . gr expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance . a superb movie !
i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie displayed in the `` horror '' section in an oxford street store and also advertised as a `` classic thriller '' . in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur askey , one of the most popular names in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades . perhaps his incessantly cheerful , exuberant and essentially good-natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much british comedy of the past twenty five years . however there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos . askey was an idol of the great tommy cooper who frequently borrowed the `` self-strangulation '' gag that arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with . there is a striking , rare appearance by the under-rated linden travers , who makes an impact as the mysterious julie .
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies , it has every thing you would want in a film , like great one liners , sexy star and a outrageous story ! if you have not seen it , you are missing out on one of the greatest films made . i ca n't wait till her new movie comes out !
i recently purchassed the very underrated dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on . i bought soul calibur ( a classic ) and then i stepped across the domain of resident evil code veronica . i have resident evil 1 & 2 , and have played res evil 3 numerous occasions , and i have been impressed with all of them , especially no.1 which has to go down in history has a classic . but none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of brilliant gory gameplay . if its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort , ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me . anyway , the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which claire redfield searches for her brother ( chris - from the 1st story ) , who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation . little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys . so aiding claire , with the assistant of super brat steve , u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother . the 2nd cd enables you to control chris , thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear . the control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic , when the character notices danger , he/she faces the direction it is coming from . pure genius ! ! overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year , game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop ! ! . please purchase this game as soon as possible .
the brilliant thing about withnail & i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery . freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16 . i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it . i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days ( had some great mates - hate to think what they 're all up to now - probably running the local council ) . i 've watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection ( how can i like this film and the dambusters - does n't seem right somehow ) i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done . i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity . i have tried to obtain the soundtrack , but it has not been released ( shame , as it 's a corker ) . someone told me it was originally a stage play , not quite sure how that worked but i 'm sure it was fun . i liked the little shakespearian touches/references that seem to crop up throughout the film ( also spotted the dylan thomas ref as well ) and like all little gems , there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to easyrider as they start they 're next journey . all in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making ( love it ! )
if you like film , do n't miss this one . if you prefer action , or horror , or romance , then you 'll wonder what 's happening . everyone here is stuck in a gangster film . and what happens is transcendental murder . there are few similar films . no doubt it will see limited release , and be hard to find . but the search will be worth it . if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol , then this is indeed a film to study . you ca n't watch it once . if you do you 'll never see what 's happening . dark city is better . joe vrs . the volcano is more fun . but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism . . .or at least to think twice before shooting again .
i first saw this when they showed this around easter time 1993/4 and did n't think much of it then , i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson ( i liked his music before ) and enjoyed it more now i am older . it is a good film but it wo n't be this classic film like the sound of music , west side story , the wizard of oz etc . michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members . there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci . the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot . my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion .
this is a good family show with a great cast of actors . it 's a nice break from the reality show blitz of late . there is nothing else quite like it on television right now either , unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too . anyway , clubhouse is worth a look because jeremy sumpter gives the main character ( pete young ) a kind of likability and naiveté that is appealing without being overly sweet and cuddly . dean cain , christopher lloyd , mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the main cast members , and each is terrific in their role . i really like kirsten storms as pete 's sister betsy ; she is quite a pill , but she still cares about her mom and brother , even though she hates to show it . it may take a few episodes to really find it 's legs , but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while , so check it out people -- you 'll be glad you did !
richard dix decided to retire and so michael duane took his place playing the role as ted nichols who meets up with a young french girl named alice dupres barkley , ( lenore aubert ) . this couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a justice of the peace ( judge ) and it is pouring rain when they pull up to the judge 's home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day . as the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an automobile part from the engine . once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which surrounds alice barkley and so poor ted nichols starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage . good mystery , but i missed richard dix . enjoy .
the mystery here is why this delightful , small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves . simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti . lacking in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations , itõs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and , unlike some of itsõ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre , such as the taste of others , it actually entertains .
and i really mean that . i caught it last night on vh1 , and i was not expecting it to be so good . this is now one of my favorites . i must add that it has a killer soundtrack .
this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff . rather , it 's for those who either appreciate a good story , or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah-ish `` this is such a wonderful movie ! you must see it ! `` -semantics ( tho ' she is right , for once ! ) . the story unfolds flawlessly , and we are taken along a journey that , i believe , most of us will come to recognize at some time . a compassionate , existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable demise . acting is without faults , cinematography likewise ( occasionally quite brilliant ! ) , and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the story . a warm movie . not excessively sentimental .
this columbo episode is probably noted more for the director , steven spielberg , as one of his early films . it should be looked at for jack cassidy 's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle . jack cassidy would appear in a later columbo . after all , columbo meets his match in jack cassidy 's character . he is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder . after his first murder , his next victim would be the annoying general store owner/widow who would blackmail him for money . rather than losing more money , he kills her . it is very entertaining to watch cassidy and falk as always . falk 's familiarity as columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years . what television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters . it 's not about who does it , how and why , it the familiarness of columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself .
i just saw this film @ tiff ( toronto international film festival ) . fans of hal hartley will not be disappointed ! ! and if you are not familiar with this director 's oeuvre ... does n't matter . this film can definitely stand all on its own . i have to go the second screening ... it was amazing i need to see it again -- and fast ! ! this film is very funny . it 's dialogue is very smart , and the performance of parker posey is outstanding as she stars in the title role of fay grim . fay grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the film henry fool ( 2000 ) . visually , the most salient stylistic feature employs the habitual use of the canted ( or dutch ) angle , which can be often seen in past hartley works appearing in various shorts , available in the possible films : short works by hal hartley 1994-2004 collection , and in the girl from monday ( 2005 ) . i viewed this film most aptly on sept 11th . textually , fay grim 's adventure in this story is backdropped against the changed world after september 11 , 2001 . without going into major spoilers , i view this work , and story-world as a bravely political and original portrait of geo-politics that is rarely , if ever , foregrounded in mainstream fictional cinema post-911 heretofore ( cf . syrianna : of side note - mark cuban exec . prod in both these films ... most interesting , to say the least ) . lastly , for those closely attached to the characters of henry fool , simone , fay and henry this film is hilariously self-conscious and self-referential . that being said , the character of fay grimm starts off in the film , exactly where she was when henry fool ended , but by the end of the film ... fay 's knowledge and experience has total changed and expanded over the course of the narrative . what can be in store for the future of fay and the fool family ... ? ? i ca n't wait for the third part in this story !
i just watched antwone fisher on bravo . what an awesome movie and incredible young man . this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult . denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher . kleenex alert -- feel good and tearful . the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother , who he was taken away from at 2 months of age . and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister . i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago . definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection .
i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about cary 's [ leslie howard ] childhood . considering that at the time not much can be shown on the screen , [ not that there is much in the novel ] the obsession of the character with mildred [ bette davis ] is very well conveyed to the audience . i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her . i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale , but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked . one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it at least .
halloween is one of the best examples of independent film . it 's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance . it is a simple movie told very well . the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores ... if you have n't seen this movie yet , you must check it out . the cast is all terrific . i wish they had never made sequel after sequel . the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel . it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie . she has n't seemed to age ( she 's just as gorgeous today , without the hairdo and seventies clothes ) . the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever !
not on the same level as ring ( or ring 2 ) but still a good japanese horror flick nonetheless . i wish north american horror producers would take a page out of the japanese horror template and put more 'spookiness ' and less cheap shocks in their flicks . lots of good examples in this one , scenes where a whited out face is scene staring behind a young actress , photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling , just for a second , and more . worth checking out if you like the genre .
i went to see vanilla sky with a huge , huge , huge ! ! .. tom cruise fan , my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can i say .. i was totally blown away by the movie and especially tc 's performance , i thought it was a very moving film and it was not at all what i was expecting . i had read the reviews and had decided not to go and see it , i am so pleased that i was 'coerced 'into seeing it . the strange thing is i can not say why , all i can say is that i found it totally involving and could not stop thinking about it the next day . as to what i felt about the film , all i can say about is , its not the storyline ( fantasy , psychodrama , whatever ) its about the people and the events that shape their life and how small events , like getting into a car can change everything ...... as to what the critics wrote , yes maybe the original was a stunning 2nd film for alejandro amenábar , but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject , and by no means a narcissistic remake for the benefit of tom cruise and penelope cruz . i can not even consider writing a couple of trite , glib sentences to describe the film just go and see it ! ! ! ! yes i know this is n't a balanced thoughtful review but so what .it 's not that kind of film .
while the premise of the film is pretty lame ( ollie is diagnosed with `` hornophobia '' ) , the film is an amiable and enjoyable little flick . it 's also a darn bit better than the films they went on to make after this one -- probably since this was the last hal roach-produced laurel and hardy film . in fact , it would n't be a bad idea not to see any of their latter films , as the entire chemistry is lost in these films and the boys play their parts purely for pathos -- something true laurel and hardy films never would do . they had a bit of an edge that all the later films lack . stan and ollie work at a horn factory . this sounds pretty funny , but it is n't . not surprisingly with all the racket , ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and must take some time off work . the doctor ( james finlayson -- in his last film with the team ) recommends an ocean voyage . however , they do n't like sailing and stan has an idea of just renting a boat tied to the dock -- then they can get all the sea air they want without all the bother ! once they are on the boat , a dangerous escaped criminal boards the boat and they all accidentally set out to sea . fortunately , this portion of the film actually was well-paced and the very end worked out very well . while not a great full-length laurel and hardy film , it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers ( like in the devil 's brother or babes in toyland ) . additionally , there is still a decent amount of physical comedy -- something you would see almost none of after this film . part of this was due to the boys ' declining health ( and ollie 's increasing girth ) and part of it was due to the overall insipidness of these later films .
red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger , wes craven . wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa . after attending the funeral of her grandmother , she decides to take the red eye flight . during waiting , she meets this man named jack rippner , ( how fffrreeaakkyy is that ? ) and they sort of become friends . ironically , both sit right next to each other on this plane . then this is when the horror starts . this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who do n't like thrilling/horror films , well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants . this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production . wes craven did well with this film . he chose the right actors , like rachel mcadams , an intelligent , sexy girl who knows what she 's doing and is cautious of everything when she 's acting in a film . cillian murphy , the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film , and his face can really widen your eyes . wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one .
i know many people have a special fondness for the alistair sim version of dickens ' story , but for me , this 1984 version is the one to beat . my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs , and we watch it together every christmas eve . i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too , because it 's a very creepy ghost story . scott -- typecast as scrooge -- is shudderingly mean and nasty , making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving . i think it 's up there with his performance in patton . the spirits are all effective , each one creepier than the last . watching the dark , floating , skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year . and what a supporting cast ! david warner , in particular , is in top form as bob cratchit , as is susannah york as his wife . i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others -- but i may be mistaken , as it 's been several years since i read it . regardless , this is a terrific christmas classic .
the only notable thing about this film is that it was steve mcqueen 's first big starring role . mcqueen 's talent is undeveloped and raw but refreshingly honest in this campy little sci-fi horror piece . steve shows himself as the anti-establishment , hot rod car loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry just five years hence . later on , mcqueen would say he hated this film and that `` he was the blob '' . but everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is cute , fresh and innocent . would that we all had stayed that way . the plot is fast paced and although predictable , still an entertaining hour or so . and it 's really fun to see steve mcqueen before he became the king of kool ( and anita corsaut before she became andy taylor 's girlfriend ) . a close friend sent me the dvd a while back and it 's a treasured addition to my steve mcqueen film collection .
bill crain 's rarer than rare 'slasher ' movie certainly does n't follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts . the bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons ; - a sin that 's virtually unacceptable in most post-halloween genre pieces . but there 's still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you 've grown to expect . just as wally koz 's surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family , mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director . looking through the credits i noticed numerous 'crains ' listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature . but despite fairly good distribution across the globe , the movie failed to make an impression either side of the atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the vhs market . nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so i strained my resources to track a copy down it all takes place in the middle of the dessert , which as i 'm sure you 'll agree is hardly the most exciting location . with that said though , i must admit that there 's certainly going to be no chance of any nosey john q laws turning up unexpectedly . four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way . chris ( jennifer mcallister ) and her boyfriend greg ( kenny johnson ) meet up with amusing new age hippies trip ( kevin mcparland ) and mary ( nicole anton ) at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune-like wilderness . greg 's older brother kyle ( todd schaefer ) and his buxom girlfriend bambi ( laura albert ) soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave . kyle used to date chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze  something that kyle does n't seem too keen to forget . sound like a motive for a massacre ? well what did you expect ? before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve . will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel ? i have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature . i do n't even know if director bill crain is aka william crain  the man behind midnight fear and blacula among others . mirage certainly does n't appear on his official filmography , so your guess is as good as mine . judging by the credible work behind the camera , i 'd have to say that i find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience . the film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from dp michael crain , and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it 's necessary . r. christopher biggs ' gore fx are imaginatively created and gruesome , and kudos to the sleepy head over at the bbfc who inexplicably let this pass through uncut on a usually stringent 18 rating . a couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre . one guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade , while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck ! there 's also some black humor that 's surely unintentional . we spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer 's boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters . but when he 's revealed to hilariously resemble keanu reeves circa bill and ted 's bogus journey , i did n't quite know what to expect . thankfully crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts chris sadistically . there are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast . the divine jennifer mcallister does a superb job as the heroine and b.g . steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse . the casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully does n't come at the cost of thespian potential . the soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation , which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by hollywood bigwigs . watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film-making at it 's freakiest . mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite . when you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck , you have to say that they did a damn good job . the flaws are numerous , but never detract credibility from the net result . unfortunately you 've probably got more chance of finding liquid gold in your coffee mug than you have of ever tracking down a copy . if you see this one covered in dust on the top shelf of your local video store , then make sure you pick it up . recommended .
adrian pasdar is excellent is this film . he makes a fascinating woman .
this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours . wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage ( as always ) gently row the plot along . there are no rapids to cross , no dangerous waters , just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best . a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received .
i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever ! i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it ! the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast . nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks ! if you like kung fu you would love this ! ! !
this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do ! the acting was the best , farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous . james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful . there are n't many movies that have riveted me as this one . the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived her horror as she went through it . farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him , yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do . the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene .
come on people . this movie is better than 4 . i can see this happening ... wealthy people have done crazier things than this . and it was funny . i watch a comedy to be entertained , escape from the pressures of the world for a short while , and not to have to take anything too seriously . this movie fully suits that purpose . i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles . i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring , likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home . it will remain on my list of `` favorite ..... must watch for the holiday season '' . if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes , watch this one .
a beautiful movie , especially if you like horses , wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage , compassion and loyalty that transcends generations . the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters ' horse in his own training . i will buy this movie and watch it again . this is a family film and i recommend it highly.a good `` family nite '' movie . although there are some violent scenes , it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film .
a must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp , or wanted to . this film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about . it is funny , it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role . if you have not seen this movie .. what are you doing ? get off you butt and run the video store . have a great summer : )
ok , so soldier is n't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable . the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant . i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie 's in the t films ( and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same ) . so to the film itself , a reasonable us/brit cast are able to flesh out this little story . not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies , so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not . the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other . kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career ( unlike maybe escape from la - sequels are such fickle creatures ! ) . sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci-fi lineage . and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly . if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance . i do n't think you will be disappointed .
where the sidewalk ends deserves to be a better known film directed by otto preminger , the man who gave the world laura . and this time , he 's got the same co-stars : dana andrews and gene tierney . it must be said that tierney here is under-used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to andrews . he plays a tough , hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him . when suspicion falls on a cab driver ( tom tully ) , he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he 's in love with the cabbie 's daughter ( gene tierney ) . tierney , by the way , looks a little too elegant for the girl she 's playing here and does n't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story . the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it 's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero . by the end , it turns into a morality tale with andrews developing a conscience over his crime . it 's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast . a good entry in the field of noir , forcefully directed by preminger and nicely played by andrews and tierney , despite the slight miscasting of her character .
the only word that sums up this movie is quirky . it 's a light-hearted romp through an existential concept . bouncy ( in more way than one ) and a bit nutty . i would n't exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it does n't seem quite as memorable as the director 's first movie `` cube '' but it 's a good pit of fluff to watch on a sunday morning . the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe that 's how it was to be written . done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension . a little like `` the matrix '' meets `` head '' meets `` human nature '' . 6.8 out of ten
here 's what i knew about `` atlantis '' before watching it : * - it 's officially disney 's first animated sci-fi adventure . i 'm not sure how accurate that is ( i like to nitpick ) but it made me curious first time i heard it described . * - the preview looked , for the most part , damn cool . evidently , it was also `` too cryptic '' according to some critics after the fact . * - it apparently did so badly that disney said , `` screw it , let 's re-release 'spy kids ' '' . so , with all that said , how is the movie ? hella-cool . i 'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway , but `` atlantis '' goes all out . it 's a throwback to all the cgi eye-candy shots in `` beauty and the beast '' and `` aladdin '' , so much so that it 's almost an effects animator 's best-of show . the characters maybe are n't that memorable ( except , perhaps , for the ship 's medical officer ) , and the plot 's a little dull , but this is n't a movie you watch for the plot . here 's a controversy that bothers me . the `` failure '' ( as in , it `` only '' took in , like , five-hundred-million or something ; i know animators who 'd kill to see fifteen bucks of that ) of this movie compared to the popularity of `` shrek '' and `` monsters inc. '' has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation . i do n't think that 's true . how do you account for the `` south park '' movie ? what about `` final fantasy '' ? really , the story and the artistry is everything , not the method . i do n't know what disney 's comeback movie will be like , but i do n't think they 're out of the picture yet .
i gave this film an 10/10 with some reluctance as it 's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years . the sheer menace on the woman in black 's face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread . i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did disturb me for years . i 'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too . so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board , this really is incredibly powerful stuff . i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not , but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people . i have n't seen it since i was 10 and i 'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some sleepless nights . i ca n't quite put my finger on what it is exactly , but i think it 's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman 's greatest weapon and that we , as viewers , are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely . it 's remarkable that other viewers ' feelings are so unanimous . i 've also seen the stage play , which was an excellent production ... but nothing can compare to this .
according to john ford 's lyrically shot , fictional biopic of abraham lincoln 's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in `` the worst way . '' ford 's camera has only praising views to reveal of mr. lincoln 's early life . but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision . uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film , what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames , ford has a unique eye for telling a story . the film sings of the life of a hopeful young man . henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to a tee , one of his best roles . the film concerns two young men , brothers , on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed . in classic angry mob style , the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them , until honest abe steps into the fray . he charms them with his humor , telling them not to rob him of his first big case , and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer . what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder-dramas thereafter , as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge , jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links . the film plays out like many john ford movies do : a tablespoon of americana , a dash of moderate predictability , a hint of sarcasm that you are n't sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself . despite the overtly 'hollywood ' feel of the film , and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln 's future presidency , the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed , if you can take your drama with a grain of salt .
i saw this movie on cable , it was really funny , from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys , jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part . i compare this movie to `` rush hour '' in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case . the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories . enjoyable soundtrack , good script , i give it 10/10 .
it has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick.i have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by gautham.from my perspective , i feel this movie is virtually flawless . surya as acp anbuchelvan-no doubt .. classy.jyothika played her role as maya very well.the character suits her very well.the character that caught movie-goers attention was pandia.jeevan played the role of pandia very well.brutal and fearsome.jeevan deservedly received the best villain award in the itfa 2004.the supporting cast of daniel balaji , devadharshini and other performed well . racy screenplay , perfectly-timed dialogues and brilliant narration by gautham.the soundtrack by harris jeyaraj are all chart-busters while the bgm suits the movie very well.cinematography by r.d . rajasekhar is rich.peter hein choreographed the stunts well.anthony 's editing is precise.above all , kaakha kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance . even some hollywood film cant compete with kaakha kaakha ... undoubtedly .
there 's a certain allure i 've always found in discovering the great ( semi- ) unknown film . these discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films - in my experience , unknown sci-fi , action and horror are unknown for very , very good reasons . i found `` high tide '' on video at a junk store , mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality . of course , that 's the only place i would find it , as it is still not on dvd . while i was watching judy davis ( as lillie ) throughout the course of this film , i was somehow certain i was watching a great undiscovered performance . yes , i had previously seen davis in several small parts - and one starring role in `` a passage to india '' . but , although she was superb in the aforementioned film , `` high tide '' is a different animal entirely . since recently watching gillian armstrong 's later film , `` charlotte gray '' , i was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her . davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to cate blanchett - in both manner and sensibility . judy davis ' performance is stunning , i can not say enough good things about it . she shares an amazing on-screen relationship with young claudia karvan ( as ally ) , this film 's other great actress . there 's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together , the details of which i wo n't presume to reveal here ( see it for yourself ! ) . there 's too much good in `` high tide '' to cover in one review . indeed , i would hardly care to - the film speaks well enough for itself . in conclusion , i would like to praise screenwriter laura jones for her stunning dialogue , director gillian armstrong for her understanding of actors , and the great russell boyd for his brilliant , understated cinematography ( please see his work in `` tender mercies '' ) .
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy `` show people '' released by mgm in 1928 . davies plays a hick from savannah , georgia , who arrives in hollywood with her father ( dell henderson ) . the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is davies outrageous southern costume . davies lands a job in slapstick comedy , not what she wants , but it brings her success . she meets fellow slapstick star william haines , who is immediately smitten with her . well , davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ( `` high art studios '' ) and lands a job in stuffy period pieces . a handsome but fake actor ( andre telefair ) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star . davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life , but of course learns that is not who she really is . marion davies is wonderful throughout , as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a `` serious '' actress . william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self , and there are cameos by charles chaplin , john gilbert , and other famous stars of the day , including the director of the film , king vidor . this is a silent film with a few `` sound effects '' as sound pictures were just coming into their own . a treasure of a film .
i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television : since then , i have never missed an episode . it 's humour is very weird , like a cross between brass eye 's social commentary , the fast show 's excellent one-liners , and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere . the best example of this was hillary briss 's special stuff - what was that all about ? the humour will not appeal to all . some will say it 's just too sick , and it 's easy to see where they 're coming from . nonetheless , give it a try . if you do n't like it , do n't watch it , but if you do like it you 'll be very glad you took my advice .
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent . kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute . susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius . karen boettcher-tate as profster was interesting . burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny . gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant . whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy . whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon . this story is about when lisa , snoodle , doodle go to the big rock candy mountains . this show is excellent the kids will like this show , new words , songs , and watching them playing .
this was a pretty good movie , i liked it . i thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it 's not about dieting , it 's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this . beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling . i also think one of the best lines in the movie is where beth yells the words , `` it 's not about you . '' to her mother . those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie . i think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie .
this was one of those films i probably never would have picked off the shelf , but it came on ifc one day and i said - eric stolz , william forsythe ... why not ? if i 'd changed the channel , i would have really missed a treasure . the subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower-class rehabilitation center . it would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear-jerker . but , that does n't happen because it was written by neal jimenez , after he himself was accidently paralyzed . no hollywood happiness here . all of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds , but they share a feeling of helplessness , of being at the mercy of others . stolz is very good as a `` lone wolf '' type , forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend ( helen hunt ) ; wesley snipes is fine as a former ladies ' man whose family is falling apart ; but william forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence . see this film .
i could n't have been more thrilled ; just eight years old back in 1983 , i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater ! the best day of my life was about to happen . to that time , my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars . i had n't even seen the empire strikes back yet . and boy , did that day deliver for my less critical eyes . jabba . big rebel spaceships . the emporer . a green-bladed lightsaber ! ! wow ! since that magical day , i must have watched this movie hundreds of times . i ca n't even form an accurate estimate at this point . with those multiple viewings , i have of course observed that this movie - the real episode iii - does have its flaws . of course in the context of a star wars movie , those `` flaws '' are more like `` quirks '' . millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 . in may of 1983 , i had mine . and this was my star wars movie .
about two hundred members of a cleveland , ohio usa film society , named cinematheque , gathered on august 19 , 2000 to view a pristine cinemascope print of michelangelo antonioni 's 1970 film , `` zabriskie point . '' cinematheque director john ewing , who does a superlative job of obtaining the finest prints for his series , shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially flown over from italy for this one showing only . the audience was held spellbound as the film unfolded its artisty on the huge panoramic screen . watching this superb print , shown the way antonioni intended , made one aware that this is indeed a modern art work . it was all the more fitting that the series is housed in the cleveland insititue of art in university circle . antonioni 's compositions are created for the cinemascope landscape . his beautiful balancing of images , striking use of colors , sweeping choreographic movements , all are the work of a genuine artist , using the screen as his canvas . at last the audience could understand `` zabriskie point . '' as its narrative unfolded , it became obvious that this work is not about story per se , but rather an artist 's impressionistic rendering of fleeting images of his subject . the setting of some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties provides only a dramatic motor for the artist 's sweeping collage . antonioni is not bound by conventional narrative standards , and can pause at any point to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments . the audience willingly went with the flow of his remarkable imagination , as his huge images on the massive canvas held one in rapt attention . while the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships , it realized the theme here is human aleination , the director 's recurring theme . it was also realized that no print any smaller or of lesser quality than this original one in cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering . the audience was therefore all the more appreciative of viewing `` zabriskie point '' in its original , breathtaking format , and broke into thunderous applause at the end .
this film is like a 1950-version of ettore scola 's brutti sporchi e cattivi . less sex and less realism , but a tale with great humanism and warmth . i would n't call this a neo-realistic picture . it 's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale , and should probably be classed as a comedy , although it deals with serious matters ( a little like chaplin or 1930-comedy ) . typical italian though , very emotional , and hard to resist except for a stone cold person . the sentimentalism is a letdown , although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama . it 's not a masterpiece like umberto d or the bicycle thief . but it is a lovable and hilarious comedy , with good music . 7/10
just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion ( and justice ) to the movie . first of all , to get things straight , this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie . it does n't aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one . if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest , i suggest you discard your critical-mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you wo n't find any in here . with that established , let us further into the movie . i had low expectations for this movie simply because it did n't have a strong plot ( yes , moviegoers , i underrated this movie as well ) , but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much . i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks ( which i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and would 've rated it a 9 as well ) . action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places . spoilers alert , i think the action might be unreal , but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways ? there are a lot other sports movies ( drama ) that already did it well , why create another ? spoilers end i 'm not even sure why you 're reading this . go ahead and watch it . just remember , no thinking - just watch , enjoy , smile , laugh , and every once in a while they ( the movie industry ) creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies , and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump . i 'm not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have , then again , if we 're talking about stephen chow-ish comedy , this one 's a top ten . highly recommended if you love : -no brainer movies with really good action -kung fu -death trance -kung fu and comedy -what the heck , watch this . you 'll have a great time . 9/10 for you the cast of kung fu dunk . ^_^
home room deals with a columbine-like high-school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors , their trauma , guilt and denial . * spoilers * the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion , with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer . the film has three protagonists ; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident , played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps . the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues . erika christensen , though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting . busy philipps , three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me , blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence . this girl was the part . it 's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls . gus van sant 's elephant ( 2003 ) though good , seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting . what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america . ten out of ten
a series of shorts spoofing dumb tv shows , groove tube hits and misses a lot . overall , i do really like this movie . unfortunately , a couple of the segments are totally boring . a few really great clips make up for this . a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie .
this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali . the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen . the film is superbly shot , i love the cinematography in this , it feels fresh and original . plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall , dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff . morgan sullivan ( jeremy northam ) is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp , a large technological corporation . he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do . it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen . it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife . after his first job things become strange , his habits change , his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares . he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster ( played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu . ) he takes an instant attraction to . however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems . he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp . the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies . sullivan , whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on ( the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages . ) suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else . digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence . sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby . digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it , they now effectively control what these spies do , except for sullivan . when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp , make sullivan a double agent . they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down . samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system . the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn . he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him . when a mysterious third party becomes involved , the person it is revealed that foster works for , sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent , who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for . the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires . the cast are great . northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent . he brings a great visual aspect to his performance , his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby . lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact . the rest of the cast are also good . director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube , has a real visual flair . he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look . for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi is n't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively . the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films , it is up there with them . the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this , that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident . the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along . this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states . * * * * 1/2
with the release of peter jackson 's famed `` lord of the rings '' trilogy , it is even easier to dismiss ralph bakshi 's 1978 animated lord of the rings film as inferior . i agree with the majority that jackson 's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of tolkien 's work , but that does not prevent me from enjoying bakshi 's ambitious pioneering effort . jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing bakshi 's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations . the film 's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable . i was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters . the pairs of pippin and merry and eowyn and galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually , the balrog and treebeard were unimpressive , but these points did n't bother me very much . however , the nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie . the only character representation i was bothered by was sam 's ; he was made to look unbecomingly silly . this film is novel for its animation techniques . in addition to hand-drawn characters , live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping . it is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped , but none the less i found that the film 's style was a novelty . the use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well . the voice acting was generally of high quality . particularly good was john hurt , who provided an authoritative voice for aragorn . aragorn is n't a favorite character of mine from the stories , but backed by john hurt 's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation . my other favorite was william squire , whose voice is appropriately strong for gandalf . the only actor who seemed inappropriate was michael scholes as sam , whose voice acting was irritating and added to sam 's unfortunately silly image . the only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names . particularly strange was the decision to frequently have saruman referred to as `` aruman '' . in producing this film , ralph bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films . hence , this film contains about half the story , from the start of `` the fellowship of the ring '' to the end of the battle at helm 's deep in `` the two towers '' . the obvious implication of this is that the film 's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books . i enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations , but the liberties taken to compress the story did n't bother me , even the choice to leave arwen out of the story . enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the lord of the rings story in 132 minutes . the battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at helm 's deep were tremendous . ralph bakshi 's version of `` the lord of the rings '' is n't perfect and no doubt a number of lord of the rings readers lament the cuts to the story . however , for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy . my only strong lament is that i am unable to see the second part of this `` first great tale '' of the lord of the rings since bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel .
`` house of games '' is a flawlessly constructed film , and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends . i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert 's review , which proclaimed it the best film of 1987 . i had my doubts , mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year . boy , was i in for a surprise . this was one of the smartest , most well-written movies i had ever seen . the screenplay is quite a piece of work , not only in terms of the plot ( which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out ) , but also in terms of character development . on my second viewing , i began to realize that mamet 's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film , but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations . the climax of the movie is particularly effective , because it is absolutely inevitable . it stems naturally from what we know about the characters , and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending . the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film . i can not picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike , and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset . their work , plus mamet 's extraordinary screenplay , combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980 's . it is truly a must-see .
. . .but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy . i 'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie , i was driving that model bus . it was only ( during his murder trial some 15 years later ) that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it . i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus ' being shot up and driven wildly . i 've been looking all over for this movie to no avail , since viewing it in the mid-80s . i liked the movie , i do n't usually watch thrillers , but after reading the summary in the tv guide , and viewing its beginning ( although fuzzy ) i stayed for the whole thing .
michelle rodriguez is a well-built high-school senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a brooklyn gym . santiago douglas is a a handsome young man , barely older than she , who also trains there . they meet after class , so to speak , and feel attracted to each other . no sex . santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout . both are participants in a `` gender-blind '' athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females , a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field . a conservative radio commentator recently announced -- and i swear i 'm not making this up -- `` let 's face it ; the president is black . '' i 'm here to make an equally perspicacious observation -- `` men and women are different . '' now , in 99 cases out of 100 , this need n't make any difference in physical performance . but in the top one percent -- trained athletes whose skills have been honed to a fine edge -- men generally have the advantage . with their narrow hips they can run faster . and they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength . these differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them . this sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection . without it , there might not be any humans at all . and that , boys and girls , is why they have men 's events and women 's events at the olympics . i speak to you as your anthropologist . that will be ten cents , paypal preferred . that 's why i called this gender-blind program misguided . as talented a boxer as rodrigues is , as she approaches the zenith of the game , she will eventually lose to a male . that 's where the complication arises in this movie . rodrigues is finally matched against her boy friend , douglas . neither wants to loose any anger on the other , not to mention roundhouse rights , but the pride of both is at stake , and the pride is both personal and gender related . douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring . and rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude . it ends happily . i was n't really expecting much from the film . i thought it would be a rip off of clint eastwood 's `` million dollar baby '' until i discovered that this was released years earlier . and i 'd never heard of the director or of any of the performers . that sort of obscurity generally augers ill -- made-for-television weepers and so forth . but i was surprised at how neatly this is put together . the total absence of bathos left me open mouthed . so did the minimal use of boxing clichés -- the frayed ropes , the blood , the cutting of the swollen eye , the battered post-bout faces , the fat and sweaty onlooker shouting `` kill him ! `` , the slow motion landing of glove on nose , the spray of sweat from the mauled head , the heroic music signaling the long-awaited apotheosis of the victor . none of that here -- well , almost none . the whole plot could be considered formulaic . tough kid finds outlet in the ring , etc . the feeling you 're left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are like . different from those we see on tv and in ordinary movies . no bells ring , for instance , instead a dancing and observant referee yells `` stop ! '' and `` box ! '' the contestants wear head gear . the gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators , but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on . it 's a clean movie , despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics . michelle rodriguez can look pretty mean , what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her lowered brow , but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants , and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals , she ai n't bad . ( a scene in which she battles her father to the floor is overdoing it . ) it was a little hard to understand douglas 's restraint when rodriguez crawls all over him in bed . the director , karyn kusama , has chosen her talent carefully . shows what you can do with some talent , imagination , and a modicum of money . there ought to be more films like it . take one of those multi-billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little .
laurence fishburne is a fine actor , and deserves respect for trying this , but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and welles ; and he further suffers from kenneth branagh . this irishman , always brilliant , cleanly steals the show away . olivier recognized that potential in his production , and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage . i did n't nearly realize the possibilities of iago , shakespeare 's most evil character , but branagh shows us the depths . nice to see the views of venice , too .
evidently , not many people have seen this movie , because no one is posting any more comments . this is not a movie to be missed . after all , it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award . paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie . eugene logan who was a co-writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity , or loss of it , by being a technical adviser to truman capote 's movie the glass house . this movie is now available on dvd . if anyone is interested , i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote . thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies .
excellent documentary , ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two west coast retro rock'n'roll bands : the dandy warhols and the brian jonestown massacre . what it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - anton newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world . interestingly , for a music documentary , there is hardly any music . what there is - snatches of songs , more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central . although the protagonists are musicians , the story is not about music but rather about a particularly american version of a british myth of a cartoon lifestyle , ie , one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full-time basis . tantrums , drugs , violence , grossly dysfunctional attitudes , egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about . as a film this is a first-class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers . for example , why is anton 's music so conservative ? for someone so wild and outrageous ( and he is wild and outrageous ) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols ( the stones , velvets etc . ) for someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level . similarly , the dandy warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969 . nothing wrong with pastiches , of course , but surely there 's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s . why do n't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did ? because , one suspects , this is not about music . music is just an accessory , a prop , or an excuse , to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives . but why ? in the dandy warhols case , the answer is obvious : to make lots of money and be famous . big deal . anton newcomb 's case is more interesting . he is obviously very talented , but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it , usually in the most dramatic way possible . he is terrified of success , and at the same time , deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the dandy warhols . fascinating movie . highly recommended .
the story of a drifter , his sheep ranch boss , and the boss 's daughter is not for all tastes , but it 's still very intriguing . it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand , amongst the scenery we 've come to know so well through other films from this region . this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan , and i 've been a fan of hers ever since . the cast also contains bruno lawrence , who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film `` smash palace '' . terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter ( regan ) . sharply acted , with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads . i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america , but believe you me , the unexpurgated version is not to be missed .
piece of subtle art . maybe a masterpiece . doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence . tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world . the life is , in this film , only exercise of adaptation . lesson about limits and original sin , about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways . leopold kessle is another joseph k. images of trial and same ambiguous woman . and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age . methaphor or parable , the movie is history of disappointed 's evolution . war , peace , business or lie are only details of gelatin-time . hypocrisy is a mask . love- a convention . the sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality .
our song is a marvelous example of passionate , movie making at its aesthetic best . it is , in fact , a genuine wonder of a movie ; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city ( crown heights , brooklyn ) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult , life altering choices that will likely re-define who each of them is , as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come . jim mckay 's writing/direction is graceful and uncluttered . there is no sappy , gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film . what we see here seems , at times , to be heart breakingly real . there is a naturalism - a credibility , if you will - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre , including american graffiti and cooley high . much of the credit for the film 's spirit goes to its principle actors . the combined presence of melisa martinez ( maria ) , kerry washington ( lanisha ) , and anna simpson ( joycelyn ) is dazzlingly powerful . it would be easy - and , of course , blatantly obtuse - to dismiss , as some apparently have , the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional . in fact , their quiet charm , their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw , sometimes unconventional intelligence , throughout the film , are absolutely riveting . one would have to be completely `` out of touch '' with , or completely indifferent to , the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen . likewise , the supporting cast , particularly marlene forte as lanisha 's mother , compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film . our song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age .
another spanish movie about the 1936 civil war . this time we 're told about the story of carol ( lovely played by débutant clara lago ) , a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york . it is such an initiating trip , and soon she 'll find about the injustices of the human race , their stupid fights and conflicts , their contradictions . imanol uribe makes his best film since `` días contados '' ( 1994 ) with such a sober pulse , a beautiful photography , and a nice script . he tries not to take part in the conflict , he just shows us some facts and let us decide ( ok , the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in ) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple : clara lago and juan josé ballesta . a well cared production . my rate : 7/10
last night i finished re-watching `` jane eyre '' ( 1983 ) , the bbc mini-series adapted from charlotte bronte 's gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of english literature with timothy dalton ( my favorite james bond ) as mr. edward rochester and zelah clarke , as jane eyre , a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl , a governess at mr. rochester 's estate , thornfield . `` jane eyre '' has been one of my most beloved books since i was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words , `` this book is amazing '' and so it was and i have read it dozens of times and i am still not tired of it . its beautiful language , refined , fragrant , and surprisingly fresh , the dialogs , and above all , two main characters , and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers . `` jane eyre '' has been adapted to tv and big screen many times , 18 according to imdb . the actors as famous and marvelous as joan fontaine and orson welles , william hurt and charlotte gainsbourg , george c. scott and susannah york , ciarán hinds and samantha morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society , laws , religion , by the differences in age , backgrounds , experiences , and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years . of all these films i 've only seen one , 300 minutes long bbc version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where timothy dalton who frequently plays dark , brooding characters did not just play edward rochester brilliantly and with class , he was mr. rochester - sardonic , vibrant , the force of nature , powerful , passionate , sexy , and tormented master of thornfield . zelah clarke was also convincing as sweet , gentle , intelligent and strong jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning , and quiet but firm willpower . added on september 17 , 2007 : during the last two weeks , i 've seen five `` jane eyre '' movies and it was a wonderful experience . there is something to admire in every adaptation of `` jane eyre '' even if not all of them are completely successful . this version is still my favorite `` jane eyre '' film .
i love ghost stories in general , but i particularly love chilly , atmospheric and elegantly creepy british period-style ghost stories . this one qualifies on all counts . a naive young lawyer ( `` solicitor '' in britspeak ) is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly , deceased woman 's estate . it 's the 1920s , a time when many middle-class brits go to the seaside on vacation for `` their health . '' well , guess what , there 's nothing `` healthy '' about the village of crythin gifford , the creepy site of the elderly woman 's hulking , brooding victorian estate , which is located on the fringes of a fog-swathed salt marsh . when the lawyer saves the life of a small girl ( none of the locals will help the endangered tot -- you find out why later on in the film ) , he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit , the woman in black . she is no filmy , gauzy wraith , but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil . the viewer only sees her a few times , but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame . as the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he 's reading through legal papers , you expect to see the woman in black at any moment . when the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house , the camera snakes in on him and you think she 'll pop up there , too . waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail-bitingly suspenseful . we 've seen many elements of this story before ( the locked room that no one enters , the fog , the naive outsider who ignores the locals ' warnings ) but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new-seeming and compelling ghost story . watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black . . .
terry gilliam traveled again to the future ( he had already done it in `` brazil '' ) to tell this story about a virus that 's destroying the human race . the script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it 's quite entertaining and gilliam proves that he 's got imagination ( the futuristic scenes are just great ) . as for the cast , bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe ( whatever happened to her ? ? ) are just ok , but brad pitt is so annoying , whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he 's not credible at all . he should just play good-looking successful young men . * my rate : 7/10
sunny , a cocktail waitress in the d.c. area , is a bit dim , to put in mildly . she drives an old clunker and rents a tiny room from a gay male couple . however , she saves the life of a prominent arab , by taking a bullet in the behind that was meant for the official . she charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks . sniffing an opportunity , presidential aides get her installed in the protocol department for the u.s. government . even then , she messes things up at times , but she tries hard and learns a lot . she even grabs the romantic attention of a state department official . but , is there another sinister plot in the making , involving an arab man who wishes to take another wife ? a blonde one ? lol , lol , lol . this movie features goldie as pretty as a picture and as dumb `` as a fox '' , as they say . sunny learns her way around the jungle of the u.s. government very , very well . she even has important things to say about honesty and the lack of it in her protocol surroundings . perhaps , the arab community would be less than thrilled with this work , but for those who like to laugh , rent this today .
along with south pacific , guys and dolls is for grown-ups - - it is sassy , sexy , and full of men being men and women being strung along . there is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the strength of jean simmond 's performance , and the charm of a young brando , and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece . guys and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is : an mgm musical . still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come . warmly recommended .
this was an excellent 2-part episode , although i had never been seen the older ones , i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal , extra terrestial of course but not paranormal . this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans , in a futuristic time , would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible . being that it 's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith , especially if its also going to entertain american audiences . but who care about what yanks say , we rock ! doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 , first being so harmless to scary , from fun to serious , from light to darkness . i hope many old fans will one day soon say `` the old doctor who has returned '' . 10 out of 10
i must admit that at the beginning , i was sort of reticent about watching this movie . i thought it was this stupid , little , romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him . i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script , since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie . still , i watched it ! and i was amazed ... '' before sunrise '' is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way , wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth , we are sentenced to death , or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity , or that , we , humans , can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales . the ending was wonderfully chosen ( we do not know if they will meet again in six months , at six o'clock , in vienna 's station ) -in our optimism , we sincerely hope so . the actors acted in a very good manner , so , that , i began to believe that i , myself could live a love-story just like this .
though `` the sopranos '' is yet another gift from the megahit `` the godfather '' and sequels , which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia , `` the sopranos '' takes another tack . no suited up , classy mobsters here with homes in lake tahoe and stakes in vegas casinos - these guys are goombahs , with a front of waste management , who deal with things that fall off the back of trucks , topless bars , protection money - in short , what the neighborhood mobs were all about . colorful characters dominate this series , which does n't hold back on the sex and graphic violence . tony soprano ( james gandolfini ) is a mob head with a wife and two children , living in new jersey , who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one . to get to the bottom of his attacks , he sees a psychiatrist , jennifer melfi ( lorraine bracco ) , who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time . tony 's henchman - paulie , his nephew christopher , his uncle junior ( the titular head of the mob ) , his good friend pussy - are all fully fleshed-out characters . as we learn going through the series , there are enemies not only from without , but from within , and one of those enemies includes tony 's sickly but horrible mother ( nancy marchand ) , who convinces junior that tony is a danger to him . tony 's sister janice , meanwhile , is searching for money in her mother 's house with a stethoscope and a geiger counter . tony has mistress problems , and a wife ( edie falco ) who puts up with a lot because she loves him , all the while keeping ties to her catholic religion . `` the church frowns on divorce , '' she tells one woman contemplating a split . `` let the pope live with him , '' is the response . as far as tony 's mistress problems , his psychiatrist points out that tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough , and asks him if it sounds familiar . yeah , it sounds like his mother . i 'm of italian descent , and yes , i 'm sick of italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all italians are mobsters . yet you ca n't help liking this show , which is a constant reminder of our culture . ( thanksgiving , it 's pointed out , is n't turkey and sweet potato pie - it 's the antipasto , the manicotti , the meatballs and escarole , and then the bird ! ) not to mention , the right-on pronunciation of words like melenzana ( mullinyan ) , escarole ( scarole ) , manicotti ( manigot ) etc . the only un-italian thing about tony is that he does n't have a finished basement , something unheard of in the rest of my family ( except my parents never had one either ) . the standouts in this show are gandolfini , as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants , falco , who is brilliant as his wife , and bracco as the tortured jennifer . but everyone is excellent . if you can take the violence and the language , this is a great show , an unrelenting portrait of new jersey mob life .
best stephen king film alongside it , though this one is more fun than scary . this one 's got it all : -a great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king himself ; -well dosed horror in an amusing storyline ; -great use of music , santo & johnny 's `` sleepwalk '' in particular ; -likeable characters in a typical king setting : middle of nowhere village ; -lots of humor . you ca n't really get good scares here because it 's too much fun and over the top ; -old but really nice makeup effects like they do n't make anymore ! a 4,5 rating : i do n't get it really . when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one ?
this is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical `` b '' film 's that i have seen ( and since i 'm in my 40 's now and only seeing this now , i am not an expert but i have seen all the well known films out there ) . when there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time , usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits , and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow . call me in a crazy kind of mood but when i saw this on tcm europe , i was laughing out loud with pleasure ! so who delivered the laughs for me ? without a doubt mischa auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs , he even steals the ending , it was great ! speaking of which , i think why this movie works is because although l & h are a selling point ( and why i got hooked to watch this one ( them and hal roach ) , i love them in their early hal roach stuff ) , this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on adult fare ( by 1930 's standards , and not that far from today 's standards if you read between the lines ) . jack haley is also great to watch , i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there , and i also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show . patsy kelly is the only `` ugly '' femme in the 30 's movies that actually turns me on ( something tells me she was a spitfire in real life ) ; and the musical numbers have a real professional production ( busby berkley'ish ) quality , that blew me away from what i am used to in this genre . i could go on and on , but rest assured i really enjoyed this movie . 8 of 10 i saw it on tcm europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on tcm usa . good stuff !
when it comes to the erotic genre , i 'm lucky to get through the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch . this movie is different . julie davis ( i love you do n't touch me ) directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller . kira is convincing as `` kim '' a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug jeffery 's `` the man '' a handsome stranger . kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role , and as actress , giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability . i believe it to be her best performance yet . and julie davis ' direction is a great gift to erotica .
a sober , reflexive piece , a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen . this quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various spanish accents ranging from mexican to peruvian , and marisa paredes ' more authentic iberian peninsular usage ! garcíadiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel : even the grand maestro garcía márquez should be proud of her superb work . and hats off to arturo ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem , a ruby , and so refined , so elegant , so sensitive , so touchingly ..... el coronel - fernando luján - is waiting to get his pension , while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the colombian jungle ( however , filmed elsewhere , not in colombia ) with his fighting cock and his wife ( in that order ? ) . and that is all there is to it . but , oh , so much more .... this film is a rhapsody . i must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible . worth the high side of 8 out of 10 , which is very high on my scale . this is not light commercial hollywood stuff .
malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere . nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest . soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell . from here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison . that leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light . honestly i think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together . anyway i was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast . the kills are raw and eerie ... its does n't take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in hellraiser . malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint . at times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger ... when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on marcus breasts it seems normal , so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be ? with its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do . i just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale . several elements like the visitor with the camera , the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end do n't fit tight in the story . anyway , i 'll keep my eyes open for other movies from director valette , although its a turn-off to see he 's is doing a hollywood remake of `` one missed call '' which was worn off and useless already in the miike-version .
yes , some plots are a bit hard to follow , and the bill does have a tendency to get violent , but it is actually an engrossing show , that i try not to miss . a vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense , and the acting is fairly good , though i do miss roberta taylor as inspector gina gold and todd carty as gabriel kent . i will admit , i prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes , and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed , as i found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00 . still , why i like the bill is because not only it is engrossing , but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable . it is true though , that it is more melodramatic than it was , but i really like this programme as a programme that does n't try to take itself too seriously . 8/10 bethany cox
when i saw commercials for this i was thinking `` no what has nick at nite done ! '' because it was taking up `` fresh prince '' slots . well , i still love the fresh prince . but george lopez is a surprisingly good show . i love how not-stereotypical benny is . carmen is a pretty good character , its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes . i feel bad for the guy who plays max , he looks much younger then he actually is ! but max is a fun character , and acted well . and yeah , angie is a little stereotypical , but she has her funny moments . ha ha george does have a big head ! nah but he can be really good too . funny show ! it definitely should be on more often then home improvement .
if you are viewing this show for the first time , you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality . colorful and imaginative characters ? entertaining dialogue ? plots that seem to have some depth to them , even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times ? i mean , this is a syndicated children 's show right ? this is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as `` pokemon '' , `` pepper ann '' , `` mighty morphin power rangers '' , and `` vr troopers '' ( please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass japanese exports , courtesy of the fox network and saban entertainment ) . do n't worry , you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980 's and early 1990 's . some examples of this period would be `` transformers '' , `` garfield and friends '' , `` captain power '' , and `` c.o.p.s . '' ( a cartoon not to be confused with the live action show on fox ) . besides these prime examples , disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids , coming up with a lineup called `` the disney afternoon '' . aside from a dumbed-down show called `` the gummi bears '' , early shows like `` darkwing duck '' , `` duck tales '' , and `` chip 'n dale 's rescue rangers '' gave credence to the disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like `` the little mermaid '' , `` beauty and the beast '' , `` the rescuers down under '' , and `` the great mouse detective '' . but above all these wonders shines `` talespin '' . the premiere of `` plunder and lightning '' was a two-hour thrill ride , and won an emmy . much to my delight , the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere . while i enjoy the plots and dialogue , i guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters . there 's rebecca cunningham , an independent female , but still fallible ; kit cloudkicker , full of pre-teen angst and optimism ; louie , with his loyalty and support ; frank wildcat , the most entertaining engineer since scotty on the original `` star trek '' ; molly cunningham , cute and witty , but with some depth that most child characters do n't have , and of course in the middle of it all , there 's baloo , whom i would describe as a slobby version of james bond . this is because whenever there 's trouble , baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker-than-most , fastest-of-all sea duck ( read : james bond 's aston martin ) . of course every great show has to have great villains , and talespin does n't disappoint here either . from the megalomania of businesstiger shere kahn , to the vain and always failing air pirate don karnage , to the hilarious and inept soviet-satirized thembrians . the animation is good , the music appropriate , and the episodes are ( for me ) the finest that children 's programming has ever had to offer . great fun for the whole family !
he 's stocky , sweaty , slightly cross-eyed and restless . he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert . he claims that we  the film viewers  perceive the screen as a toilet bowl , and are all secretly wishing for all the s * * t to explode from the inside . he 's unpredictable and scary . well ? come on , you could have guessed by now : he 's one of the leading philosophers of our age . slavoj iek is both a narrator and a subject of sophie fiennes ' extraordinary new film , a pervert 's guide to the cinema . fiennes illustrates a feature-long lecture by iek , and does so in two ways : by providing exemplary film clips and putting iek on real ( or reconstructed ) locations from the movies he speaks about . it 's always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies ( although revenge of the sith got here as well ) , but the main attraction of a pervert 's guide is iek himself . what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one can not help but ask over and over again : what is more outrageous , iek 's views or iek 's screen presence ? in a documentary by astra taylor ( iek ! , 05 ) , slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent . because , he claimed , he feels like he does n't exist in the first place , the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly . and talk he did , and how . also a pervert 's guide is dominated by his voice  delivering perfect english in most crazy way , and making some astonishing points about the cinema . what are those ? well , for example he sees chaplin 's reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself ( kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night [ 45 ] ) . he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects , not to provide us with them . he identifies groucho marx as super ego , chico as ego and harpo as id . he says a million other interesting things , and all the time we can not take our eyes off him , so persuasive ( and captivating ) are his looks . at some point i could n't help but stare at his thick , scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath . craving , of course , for more insights . most notable are iek 's readings of lynch and hitchcock ( which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them ) . the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of iek 's lecture memorable and  unlike others  difficult to argue with , since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors . this does n't go for his reading of tarkovsky for example , upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality , dismissing precisely what 's so remarkable in all tarkovsky ( namely strong religious intuitions and images ) . the question is n't whether iek is inspiring and brilliant , because he is ; or whether fiennes film is worth watching , because it is likewise . the real question is rather : are iek views coherent ? one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride , but after the whole thing is over , some doubts remain . for example : while considering vertigo ( 58 ) iek states that what 's hidden behind human face is a perfect void , which makes face itself only a facade : something of a deception in its own means . however , when in the final sequence we hear about the ever-shattering finale of city lights ( 31 ) as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another , it 's hard not to ask : what happened to the whole facade-thing ? why should we grant chaplin 's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novak 's of this same privilege in two bold strokes ? or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacan 's terms ? ( the name of the notoriously `` unreadable '' french psychoanalyst is fundamental to iek 's thought . ) the film has all the virtues of a splendid two-and-a-half hours lecture : lots of ground are covered , many perspectives employed , even some first-rate wisecracks made ( when iek travels on a melanie daniels ' boat from the birds [ 63 ] and tries to think as she did , he comes up with : `` i want to f * * k mitch ! '' ) . but it has also one shortcoming that is n't inherent to two-and-a-half hours lecture as such : it 's almost obsessively digressive . iek 's yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn , but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of iek 's perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on , changing subjects constantly . overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant , cool , fizzing wave : you 're simultaneously taken by surprise , refreshed , in mortal danger and confused no end . as you finish watching , your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you 're already planning on re-watching some films  but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity . the ultimate question is : did iek lost it ? or have n't we even came close to the real thing ? once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment , we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other ( not having any movies around to turn our faces to ) . i dare you all : who will have enough guts to approach iek and defy him ? my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life , you become a believer .
the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia ( brooke adames ) & bradley marshall ( jeff hayenga ) who have tried for the last five years to conceive , virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child . they visit dr. richard meyerling ( james karen ) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends , dr. meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child . dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant . at first everything seems perfect & the marshall 's could n't be happier , but their picture perfect lives do n't last for long as virginia 's pregnancy develops problems , she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth ( jane cameron ) , another woman who has undergone dr. meyerling 's procedure , who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher . virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her ... produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller ( it 's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe ) that pleasantly surprised me . the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least . the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects , it 's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears . it moves along at a fair pace although it 's not exactly an action packed film by any means . the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then , maybe flender knew something the rest of us did n't . on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times . also , i have to mention it , what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh ? ! director flender does an ok job , the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it 's good enough . the atmosphere is good & there 's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr. meyerling 's sinister plans are n't fully revealed until the last possible moment . disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens , the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i 'll remember too much about it . technically the film is ok , i 'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it 's well made even if it 's a little bland & forgettable . the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement . the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends ( 1994 - 2004 ) star lisa kudrow , i have to be honest i do n't like friends & i do n't even know who she was in this so i ca n't tell you how she did . the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen , it 's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves . if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different , something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn . followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii ( 1994 ) which i watched straight after this , check my review out if you want ..
this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see . while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise ; it 's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive , despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film . it 's good to know that films like this are still being made ( even if they are n't getting wide releases ) , and cypher is refreshing for that reason . the plot twists and turns , which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher 's mystery . the plot follows morgan sullivan ; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons , to him , unknown . however , his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita ... this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it 's apocalyptic imaging of the future . this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type , with it 's only real close affiliate being kubrick 's a clockwork orange . the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing . you never quite know where you are with the plot , which serves in making it all the more intriguing . the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars ; jeremy northam and lucy lui . northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale , and does well with his role . lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that does n't quite fit her talent , but she has a look about her that just fits this movie . cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent ; but on the whole , if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film ; cypher is the way to go .
personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem . way back in the eighties , the early eighties , i discovered this movie , like so many released at the time , `` night patrol '' `` bad manners '' or even `` king frat '' the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you . of course being of an age , movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like `` screwballs '' and the many others , captured the imagination , and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches . made many years after the huge success of `` animal house '' and having seen how it had fared down through the years , i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory , much like that of national lampoon 's vacation . to be honest , not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success , however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies , with instantly recognisable characters , such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham , so good in charles band 's `` terrorvision '' still lingering in the past glories of his youth . or how about stephen furst 's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs . sweet as . which makes me ponder . as i already said , personal taste not withstanding . people can be so cruel , so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its 's peers within the comedy world . it does have some merit . being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes , who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work `` weird science '' as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u.s bonds . what more can i say , it 's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered , time and time again .
before viewing , please make sure you have seen night of the living dead ... this might well be the best 7 minute parody i have ever seen ! absurd , crappy 'special effects ' ( the rope , the rope ! ! ! ) , and maneating slices of bread ... what more do you need ? ? ? ( do not watch this movie while eating bread ... you might get scared ! )
if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head . the representation of hobbits , dwarves etc have had the 'disney ' treatment . the dark riders are excellent , and as i had always imagined from the books . cinematically this is an excellent film , mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year . i only wish he ( bakshi ) had been given the money to complete his epic . it 's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings ! !
a big surprise , probably because i was expecting it to suck . the reviews were pretty dismissive of it , even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden : a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero , and finds , when he wants to break up with her , that she 's kind of a psycho . i kept expecting it to fall apart , but it never really did . sure , it does n't make as much of its awesome premise as it could , and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film 's universe . but i ca n't blame it for that . uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero , g-girl . and i 've discovered , after several years of disliking him , that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub . he 's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 ( the other in the pretty much unreleased idiocracy ) . i absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex . it 's one of the funniest sex scenes ever . my only real complaint is that they make g-girl a bit too much of a psycho , like almost unbelievably so . maybe with some background i could have accepted it better . i can forgive its flaws , though , because i had a really good time watching it . underrated , for sure .
such a delightful movie ! very heart warming . one ca n't help falling in love with the character of gigi . he 's adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist . the whole movie revolves around him . he lives in a wonderful world  living all life  curiosity , desire and anticipation . there is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life . the father is very stereotypically italian and so is the mother . i wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene  and have them cry and laugh . i also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother . his personality seems to have been trashed entirely . passion and ardour  that 's the key to life . and looking through the camera  focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life .
as i watched one of orson welles ' last contributions to hollywood as a filmmaker , i knew i was watching a great movie unfold , though at times i did not know why . the story in the lady from shanghai has the prime elements of a film-noir : average-joe lead , femme fatale , conspicuous supporting characters , and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure . it is an entertaining ride , and it 's filled to the brim with welles ' unique gifts as a director , but there are scenes that tend to just not work , or do n't feel complete in what was welles ' full vision ( the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer harry cohn and the columbia execs are to blame for that ) . welles co-stars with his then wife , the profoundly gorgeous rita hayworth , as mike o'hara , an irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people . hayworth is mrs. bannister , married to mr. bannister ( everett sloane , who played mr. bernstein in citizen kane ) , who is accompanied by a friend mr. grisby ( glenn anders , who has great control in his eyes ) . they want to go sailing on their yacht and take o'hara along for the ride , and at first he 's reluctant , but agrees since he 's falling for the married mrs. as their journey unfolds , o'hara finds that bannister and grisby are not pleasant to be around , and more so with grisby , who at first seems out of his gourd . yet as the plot unfolds , o'hara is drawn into a scam that grisby is planning for insurance money , with results that i dare not reveal ( although they have been discussed over and over by others ) . whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story ( and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated ) , the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty-five years . though he does n't have the terrific greg tolland ( kane 's dp ) at his side , dependable charles lawton jr. assists welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark , covered in shadows , deep focus , low angles , the works . a particular accomplishment is the fun-house mirror scene , which is merely a highlight among others . welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent is n't anything special- and hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush , despite her path in the story . the lady from shanghai is worth checking out , especially for welles , hayworth , or film-noir buffs ( fans of the coen brothers might find this fascinating as well ) . it may just take a little while , repeat viewings ( as was for touch of evil ) , for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in .
lizzie borden 's love crimes is an important film , dealing with the dark side of female sexuality ( and including full frontal female nudity , which sure beats the male kind ) . it flirts with sadomasochism and the captive falling in love with captor theory . this treatment of feminine libido is sometimes shallow and jerky , but borden has travelled well beyond feminist dogma of females gaining power through their insatiable lust . one striking scene exposes the female fetish for horses , when the antagonist , a counterfeit fashion photographer , is seducing an older woman wearing breeches by asking her to show how she rides a horse . he shoves a riding crop between her legs , pressing it against her crotch , and this greatly increases her excitement . then suddenly he leaves her home and she swears abjectly at the closed door . patrick bergin plays the con artist , and though he falls a long distance from handsome , he picks on plain janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line . by all reports , sean young proves a weird person , and she is scarcely beautiful . yet in this film as the district attorney her intense face and long-limbed slender body and accentuated hips and periodically disjointed movement alchemize into erotic fascination . her performance is forceful and complex . borden possesses an intriguing worldview , and the fact that it stands so at odds with the modern feckless zeitgeist i truly appreciate .
for all the hoopla , respect and recognition this film gets from kung fu historians , it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas : action and fight scenes . but i must say that the plot is probably the best and most original i 've ever seen in a martial arts film . five deadly venoms without a doubt is a must see , not only that , a movie you can watch again and again ; but i also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better . it somehow leaves you wanting something , you want more . the producer chang cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but does n't follow through with giving us more of the action we want . the fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer ( centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard , toad ) and they are shown , but battles are noticeably short . the toad and snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much , much more , in fact the toad is killed off by the middle of the movie . interestingly enough with this movie , the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot , this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome . this movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe . sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel . to start off the movie and to introduce the poison clan producer chang cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon . the ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more . still though this movie is one of shaw brothers best and is quite enjoyable . my overall impression of the movie would conclude with this : the styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail , sad thing is , the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and did n't expand on it . i am left wondering what could have been with this movie , still one of the best though . 8 out of 10 on the scale .
if you like jamie foxx , ( alvin sanders ) , '' date from hell '' , '01 , you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp , ( jumbo size ) and at the same time lots of gold bars . alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw , and david morse , ( edgar clenteen ) , `` hack '' '02 tv series , decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals . there is lots of laughs , drama , cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard . jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture .
over-powered mobile suits that can annihilate entire armies - check ! weapons that hardly need to be aimed and still annihilate everything - check ! mobile suits based on angels - check ! ok - its a gundam series . this one , gundam wing , has good character development , real-world complexity , interesting ideas and some pretty eye-candy . with characters , the initially weak relena dorlan ( later peacecraft , then back to dorlan ) gets stronger and more independent ( although is still absolutely besotted with heero yuy , the series main character ) . the aforementioned heero , initially a cold , hard butcherer , becomes more and more human , while still remaining in-character . and seeing the lost millardo peacecraft ( whos nomm de guerre is zechs marquise ) float between oz , freelance , and command of white fang shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations . the complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting how the real world works . however , in 49 half-hour episodes , it does become a bit of a liability in that this complexity is n't used to its full potential . the ideas at the core of the series - the necessity of fighting , the desire for peace , etc - are ones that resonate even today . in retrospect , the series was ahead of its time , what with the `` war on terrorism '' and all . but its exploration of these ideas , the monologues , especially those of treize kushrenada , is an incredible dramatic piece , forming some of the best writing in the series . but that sometimes good writing is also sometimes extremely poor , which dramatically causes it to lose some of its edge . in terms of eye-candy , which is what this one has in bucketloads , everything from the mobile suits to the battleship libra ( no not the tampons you idiot ! ) is wells designed , and explodes in big balls of orange ( which is bad , because better animation would 've had better explosions ) . but who cares ? ! stuff explodes , and thats all that matters . in short though , the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes , you 've missed out on a lot . the poor writing can leave you cringing , and sometimes the animation makes you go `` wtf ? ! ? ! '' but this is made up for in its classic animation style , its scale , sparks of incredible dialogue , and its more mature exploration that one expects of such japenese animations .
seeing `` moonstruck '' after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this film was when it first appeared . who knew that cher could act ? who had ever heard of olympia dukakis ? nicholas cage was the beginning of his career , and vincent gardenia and danny aiello were not known for their comedic talents , nor was norman jewison the director . the only really flat note in this splendid work is `` when the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie , that 's amore , '' a song that is sung too many times in the movie ( once is already too many ) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music . cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as loretta castorini , a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom . aielo ( johny cammareri ) obliges by proposing , offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring , then rushes off to sicily to be with his dying mother . he charges loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother , ronny , attends the wedding . loretta confronts ronny and quickly falls in love with him . meanwhile , her father ( vincent gardenia ) is cheating on her mother ( olympia dukakis ) , which loretta accidentally discovers when ronny invites her to the metropolitan opera . everything works out in the end , as it inevitably does in films of this genre . in the meantime , all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself . in its way , `` moonstruck '' is how hollywood used to be at its best : rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever . if they 'd only lost `` that 's amore '' along the way , it would have been perfect .
i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in 1969 . after actually seeing it , however , i 'm not surprised anymore . it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style , cinematography , and use of flashback to help develop joe buck 's character . the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe buck 's character in such a short movie . i think voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked . the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him . i think when he looks in the mirror he 's trying to see if it 's really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible . i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role . otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate . anyway , this considered an all-time great for a reason .
this is jackie chan 's best film , and my personal favourite . after the disappointing u.s made 'the protector ' directed by james glickenhaus , jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong . this is also probably jackies most violent movie , with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts . the action is fast and furious , jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design . bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you 'll see in the credits . the script is a simple cops and robbers affair , nothing special , after all it was written around the action . i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing , but it should n't put you off too much . so , get the lads round , crack open the beers and enjoy . by the way , the film was nicknamed 'glass story ' by the stunt crew . why ? i 'll let you find out for yourself ! !
this is the first review i 've wrote for imdb so bare with me , but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it . richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective who bends the rules to get the job done . i think the story is great , and there 's never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down . some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking , but if you 've ever seen a crime film like se7en , you 'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine . so all in all , if you 're looking for a good detective/suspense movie , ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it .
i saw this movie on tv when it came out , and never seen it again . for the life of me , i could n't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy thinne 's movie credits . excellent , dark , and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as `` crowhaven farm '' ; `` do n't be afraid of the dark '' ; and `` satan 's school for girls '' , all lost satanic classics . i also think it has many parallels to clint eastwood 's classic , `` high plains drifter '' . why do n't they release these great little movies , especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal-mart ? most of these flicks have a cult-following , so sales should n't be a problem .
taking over roles that jack albertson and sam levene played on broadway , walter matthau and george burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics , a team in the tradition of joe smith and charles dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life . walter matthau ca n't stop working , the man has never learned to relax , take some time and smell the roses . he 's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent richard benjamin is finding less and less work for him . what hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner george burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family . a workaholic like matthau ca n't comprehend it and take burns 's decision personally . benjamin hits on a brain storm , reunite the guys and do it on a national television special . what happens here is pretty hilarious . the sunshine boys is also a sad , bittersweet story as well about old age . matthau is on screen for most of the film , but it 's burns who got the kudos in the form of an oscar at the ripe old age of 79 . burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well . as we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of burns & allen who the monty python troop borrowed a lot from . in 1958 due to health reasons , gracie allen retired and george kept going right up to the age of 100 . or at least pretty close to as an active performer . the sunshine boys is based on the team of smith & dale however and if you like the sunshine boys i strongly recommend you see two tickets to broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the american public at the turn of the last century . the doctor sketch that matthau and burns do is directly from their material . and i do think you will like the sunshine boys .
in this `` critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events , gabriel ( robin williams ) , a celebrated writer and late-night talk show host , becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother ( toni collette ) . when troubling questions arise about this boy 's ( story ) , however , gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret '' according to film 's official synopsis . you really should stop reading these comments , and watch the film now ... the `` how did he lose his leg ? '' ending , with ms. collette planning her new life , should be chopped off , and sent to `` deleted scenes '' land . it 's overkill . the true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious , by the time mr. williams returns to new york . possibly , her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the `` highway '' or `` video tape '' scenes . the film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a `` director 's cut '' ? williams and bobby cannavale ( as jess ) do n't seem , initially , believable as a couple . a scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage . otherwise , the cast is exemplary . williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization , and not a `` gay impersonation '' . sandra oh ( as anna ) , joe morton ( as ashe ) , and rory culkin ( pete logand ) are all perfect . best of all , collette 's `` donna '' belongs in the creepy hall of fame . ms. oh is correct in saying collette might be , `` you know , like that guy from 'psycho ' . '' there have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women , due to a slighter dispersion of roles ; certainly , they could have noticed collette with some award consideration . she is that good . and , director patrick stettner definitely evokes hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful . finally , writers stettner , armistead maupin , and terry anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere . * * * * * * * the night listener ( 1/21/06 ) patrick stettner ~ robin williams , toni collette , sandra oh , rory culkin
i know anime . i 've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon ; i loved ranma before most people knew what dragonball z even was . and just so you know i 'm not bragging about my , let me say this : out of all the animes i 've seen , castle in the sky is by far one of the best . it 's obvious people say spirited away is the best , but i really disagree . most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award ; this is n't an exaggeration - i 've shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people who 'd only ever seen spirited away , and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three . personally , i 'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke , until i finally saw castle in the sky . i still think that the prior is the better of the two , but castle in the sky is easily on par with it ; in many ways , castle has major elements that mononoke was missing . in either case , if you 've only seen spirited away , and think that that is miyazaki 's best film , be prepared to have your earth shaken .
i 'm 60 years old , a guitarist , ( lead/rhythm ) , and over the last forty years , i 've been in four bands , it 's all there , the fights , the foul-ups , the rotten food , the worse accommodation , always travelling , little or no money , and every one was drunk or high . but , the clubs , the fans , and the music , made it all worth it ! just like strange fruit ! i 'm too damn old for it now , and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking , but for the length of that video , it all came back , and it was all there ! the birds , the brawls , and the booze ! and i was young again ! it 's just like billy connolly 's voice over , god likes that 70 's stuff ! rock on forever !
this film starts out with a family who were all going in different directions and their teenage daughter martha macissac ( olivia dunne ) was very much in love with joe macleod , ( zack ) . the mother is played by mitzi kapture , ( jill dunne ) who suddenly walks in on her daughter and zack making out and then all kinds of problems seem to surface . jill dunne has a husband who is always traveling or staying away from the home quite often . there are also big problems that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip which their daughter olivia dislikes and just can not adapt to sleeping outdoors and requires a tent to be kept out all the bugs . in many ways , olivia does an outstanding performance as the teenage and nick mancuso , ( richard grant ) gives a great supporting role as a hotel owner . this film will keep you guessing how it will end and you will enjoy a film filled with plenty of horror and terror . enjoy
i saw this movie years ago on late night television . back then it went by the title of `` stairway to heaven '' . even as a young boy , i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial ( those who have seen it know what i 'm talking about ) . such imagination ! a perfect blend of romance , drama , humour and fantasy , this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made : citizen kane , casablanca , gone with the wind . this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so - over 51 % voters rated it 10 out of 10 ; over 84 % rated it 8 or higher out of 10 . i was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until i realized so few have seen/rated this movie , compared to those on the list . what a pity . i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region 1 ( north america ) , so that 1 ) , i can purchase it , and 2 ) , others discover this hidden treasure .
i saw `` fever pitch '' sort of by accident ; it was playing on the airplane going over to europe . it actually was n't half bad . ben ( jimmy fallon ) is the world 's # 1 red sox fan , but his relationship with lindsay meeks ( drew barrymore ) may strain that . the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples ' relationships . it 's especially eye-opening now that the red sox have ended their 80-odd-year losing streak . i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just do n't tend to notice them . not too bad . another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000 's `` frequency '' . check them both out .
i have n't seen all of jess franco 's movies , i have seen 5 , i think , and there are more than 180 of them . so maybe it 's a bit early to say so but `` necronomicon geträumte sünden '' ( better known as 'succubus ' , but that is the cut version ) is according to me if not the best , certainly on of franco 's best . franco is best known ( although 'known ' might be slightly exaggerated ) for `` vampiros lesbos '' , a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90 's when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer . through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the cucumber ' ( 'vampyros lesbos ost ' ) : jess franco is an overwhelming director . when the phone rang during 'vampiros ' , i let it ring . i just wanted to see more of the movie . since that moment franco never could grip me that much . but then i stumbled on this movie . it is even better than `` vampiros lesbos '' , i think . franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera . we find out he can do a lot . i certainly did n't expect to find `` necronomicon '' that great : its beginning did n't impress me at all . remember , i had seen `` vampiros lesbos '' before ( although chronologically that came only three years later ) and both movies kinda start the same . but then the story went on , puzzling and gripping , beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he were n't so occupied with spreading his political messages . later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or was n't old-fashioned . the man says that all movies have to be old-fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed . but the girl replies that `` bunuel , fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow '' . janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon , a franco regular , is also there . luckily the acting is good ( something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you , but not this one ) . but certainly watch out for the dummy scene . the erotic tension , the wild directing and the fact that it 's a yesterday 's movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see . the fact that it is a bit more accessible than `` vampiros lesbos '' certainly helps .
i first saw this video 15 years ago . i thought it was excellent then and i still do . i am a former teacher of english ( high school and college ) and a lover of english romantic poetry , so coleridge rates highly with me . anything which might detract from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would n't get my vote of excellence . in this case , everything works well to engage the viewer , especially high school students . the story is well illustrated for a generation which grew up on television . in addition , the voice of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authority to it . okay , so there was n't a big budget for the project . so it was n't star wars and there 's no cgi in it . but who can dismiss gustave doré illustrations as part of the presentation ? the comment above , which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash , is grossly unfair and unperceptive . i 'm a friend of the producer , but that is n't my reason for this comment . rather , i 'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels . it is well suited to bring coleridge 's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts .
although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows : `` fire in space '' and `` living legend '' , if you watch the original shows you 'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out . i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it . i would say if you want to see the show in its original version , see the video versions on vhs . they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now . another good video is conquest for the earth , which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves . overall , i rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers .
rock star : inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched ! it had some of the greatest rock n ' roll songs ever written , performed by 15 very talented singers/performers . it also had ( in my opinion ) the most heart-felt , feel-good , surprise endings in all of reality tv . it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner ! ! ! over the 13 weeks of this televised competition , the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants . after 30-some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show . and the fact that inxs was , and still is , one of the greatest rock n ' roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series . if you do n't have the series recorded , rock star : inxs the dvd is a great alternative .
i was very pleased to go and see a `` milanese '' film shot in milan . alessandro alatri is a roman director who has understood properly and fortunately printed in a film the milanese philosophy . film tells the story of a standard -in career- milanese couple , starting from `` the birth '' to the death . the birth-wedding is so typical out of any scheme that becomes original and involves all the wedding guests in a flash back story of how the couple came to each other and felt in love . life is hard in the `` urbe '' of milan and after the sweeties old days became tougher and tougher , then finally the product : a child , who instead of strengthen further the couple relationship it weaken because `` the selfish effect '' typical of a nowadays `` metropolis '' personality . the advertising environment with all the `` creative '' under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot . we are losing the life values and this is well and deeply reflected in this nice and sharp movie from the senza pelle 's director . the actors are well chosen , stefania rocca nice and well characterised , and a positive surprise , an unexpected good fabio volo , well known by the `` trash '' tv serie : le iene . rating : 7/10
this animated feature ( a co-production between ireland , belgium and france ) deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie : the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript , the book of kells . in this fantastic retelling of that story , a prepubescent boy named brendan , living in a monastery ruled by his uncle , a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings , must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named aidan needs to finish the book . to do that task , in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named aisling.gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand ( there is some computer animation in a few key passages ) in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional celtic art , and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes , this film is relentlessly strange , but is a good strange , not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort . if one were to nitpick - beyond some anachronisms , like an african monk in 9th century ireland  one would have to say that the blend of catholic mysticism with celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce . and the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad . that 's why i can not give them the highest ranking . but these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film .
what percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars ? answer : too many ! this movie is n't like that . it is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable . downside : not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind . upside : forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives . well acted by : scott cohen , judd hirsch , susan floyd , ato essandoh and elliot korte . contains some good lighthearted humor .
when you see the cover of the dvd you 're convinced this is some class b cheesy cheapie , a film made for $ 1,000 in somebody 's backyard . wrong ! this is quality material and really good . it 's a comedy and a clever one at that . it also is very touching in spots , with a nice spot of kindness . the production values are very good ( this looks excellent ) , the actors are known , the film 's direction and sets are great . it 's amazing . who would have thought ? carrie-ann moss , playing against-type , is terrific , as '' helen robinson , '' the june cleaver-like wife ; billy connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie `` fido ; '' tim blake nelson ( `` mr. theopolis '' ) is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend `` tammy , '' and henry czerny and dylan baker as dads ( check ) are excellent , too k'sun ray as young `` timmy robinson , '' should n't be overlooked , either . in fact , he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone . if i explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it . you 'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very , very pleasant surprise . you need a dark sense of humor , though ; an appreciation of the absurd .
if you enjoy the subtle ( yes , i said subtle ) actions and reactions of john candy , you ca n't help but like this film ( pronounced `` fillum '' by salvatore dipasquale ) . the unobservant ( and uninformed ) watcher always saw candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon . and sometimes he was ( see `` stripes '' and `` splash '' ) . but , when given the opportunity , he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle . it 's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side , because we 'll never get to see more of the other . oh , yeah , the movie . one can watch `` going berserk '' over and over ( i know i have ) with the frequency of `` caddyshack . '' it 's just that good . the plot , although a little convoluted , is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind . it allows candy and the always under-rated joe flaherty and eugene levy to bounce off of candy ... and they bounce hard . definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed sctv or candy 's other work .
a few years ago i added a comment to the imdb on `` the real mccoys '' tv series . i said then and repeat now it was a charming , funny , and entertaining show , well-acted with wonderful characterizations . i recently saw on dvd four old episodes plus the reunion of 2000 with richard crenna , kathy nolan , and tony martinez . as another writer here mentioned , it is curious that lydia reed ( hassie ) and michael winkelman ( little luke ) were n't refered to , but perhaps they can be tracked down via sag or aftra . the reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show . one piece of inside information we did not get was whether or not kathy nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute , which left luke a `` widow '' in it 's last year , which was n't very good . nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called `` broadside '' , about women nurses in the pacific in ww ii . get it ? broadside ? no , not funny . unlike the sleazy , salacious , and violent trash on tv now that is so undermining our values , `` the real mccoys '' entertained with decent values and fine human beings . and i thank all involved , including the creator , irving pinkus , for having brought it to my family . we never missed it .
i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it . i did n't know anything about the story , the cast , the director , or anything about the film 's history . all i knew was it was a highly-acclaimed french film . had i known more , i probably would n't have viewed the picture with an open mind . on paper , the premise does n't sound interesting to me . had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time , my interest while watching would have been limited . however , not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it . throughout , i had no clue has to where the story would go , what the characters would do , and what the end result would be . it was , if nothing else , not a predictable film . indeed , it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks . telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers . since the lead character is seen in present day , the audience knows she will remain alive . by using the flashback technique , director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage , giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside . a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard-looking face , one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood . instead , denis presents france as a beautiful girl , someone who looks fine on the outside . it could be argued that chocolat is more about france 's mother since she is given far more screen time , though i believe it is ultimately about france . to me , what chocolat is really about is how a mother 's actions affect her daughter . it is about how parents ' behavior stays with their offspring . france is not ruined by her mother 's actions in the story , yet her mother 's actions clearly made an impression on france . had france not been affected at all by her mother 's actions , the flashback aspect would be irrelevant . for a movie that deals with two time periods , the past and the present , chocolat was a very well paced , there were no scene of excess fat . none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place . the film had nice rhythm , the editing crisp , leaving only what was necessary to tell the story . with a well told story , solid editing , and organized directing , chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen . it was responsible for launching claire denis ' career and with good reason : it 's an incredible directorial debut .
this was the most visually stunning , moving , amazing and incredible story i 've ever experienced . quite frankly , even those adjectives just can not describe it . i ca n't just choose one scene that stood out for me . i suppose if i had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims ; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator , who were unaware of what was going on , as they finally emerge to the horrific scene ; the shock and disbelief of the onlookers ; and finally the silence . on that day , and even now , i am reminded of star wars ( 1977 ) . obi-wan says , ` i felt a great disturbance in the force , as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced . ' it is amazing how it is so accurate in its description . there was truly a disturbance in the force . this documentary vividly reveals this disturbance . the feelings are so incredibly visual . the anger , the frustration , the shock , the fear , the exhaustion , and the realization of its very magnitude . it 's all there . not a thing is missed . this is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the emmy . not just because it documents 9/11 but because it is simply everything it should be . if you plan to watch , be sure to grab a box of tissues . you 'll need them . i know that i did .
i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this . but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is . this hbo special features him teaching `` american history '' to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal . he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the u.s. but some other parts of the world . this documentary/comedy was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true . i enjoyed how mr. wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting . i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his/her beliefs .
i do n't doubt that victor mclaglen won his best actor oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the mutiny on the bounty leads of clark gable , charles laughton , and franchot tone who were all in the same race . but the informer is still a fine film because john ford would n't have gotten his first best director oscar if it was n't . no split involved in his award . the movie and the story by liam o'flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named gypo nolan who was once a member of the irish republican army . he was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in . he 's down to his last pence and if he ca n't get back in , wants enough for passage to america . there 's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named frankie mcphillip played by wallace ford . in a moment of weakness he goes to the black and tan constabulary and informs on mcphillip . the ira is pretty anxious to find out who ratted mcphillip out and they 're pretty certain it was mclaglen . he has n't the wit to really cover his own tracks . he does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named peter mulligan played by donald meek . he also picks up a hanger-on played by j.m . kerrigan . the whole action of the informer takes place in 1922 in dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning . of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows , making it possibly the first noir thriller . had it been done post world war ii the informer would have ranked as a great noir classic , like odd man out or the the third man which it bares a lot of resemblance to . john ford knew this world very well . he took some time off during the rebellion and was in ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the ira . his real name before having it anglicized was sean o'fiernan . preston foster plays the ira commandant dan gallagher . in the book gallagher is a harder and meaner man than foster has him here . my guess is that john ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest . he makes it clear that foster has to eliminate the informer because the black and tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril . the ira trial scene is the highlight of the film . when foster asks donald meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court , meek ai n't in a position to say no . the king 's justice and writ does not run here . it graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary , the british are indeed losing their grip on the population . of course the informer a rather grim story has its john ford touches , but rather fewer than you would expect . even as mclaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree , the ira is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing . the informer is a tale well told about ireland in a grim and dismal time .
historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans . starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin . this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women , because these were free people . they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors . the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives , whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community . i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe , anna bella , and marcel .
had this movie been made just a few years later , i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor . at times , the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes ( normal ambient sounds are missing ) . but , given it was 1931 and a french movie , this is quite forgivable . especially since this also occurs in later french films -- by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely ( such as in l'atalante from 1934 ) . okay , apart from some minor sound problems , this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it . and , during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you ca n't help but like . a nice charming film all-in-all .
poorly cast , terrible script full of holes , hot blonde gets eaten alive , the evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache , one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor , terrible special effects , they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster ... awesome . the only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings . haha . good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners . i highly enjoyed this movie , but before you watch it make sure you 're in for a good laugh . i recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so serious . i can not , in my right mind , think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously . however , if you can watch it and sit back and just enjoy , i really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed . very simply . so get some popcorn and a couple beers and have a fun night with some friends and this movie . it brought some joy into my life .
there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first . the answer to one of the clues is murphy 's law : anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . this is exactly the case for dan burns ( steve carell , the office ) a columnist for the local newspaper . dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life , yet he comes to realize that things are n't so picture perfect in his own . dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy , tragedy , and beauty of them all . besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious . the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own ... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life : the first one anxious to try out her drivers license , the middle one well into her teenage angst phase , and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood . things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore . her name is marie ( juliette binoche , chocolat ) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations ... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household . if you 've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine , you 'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well . steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life : the frustration and sincere compassion . the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax . the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes , yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability : which is an irony within itself . dan in real life is definitely worth seeing , for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life , and i 'll most likely enjoy it a second time , or even a third . just `` put it on my tab . ''
presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland , along with her standard singing moments . the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break . i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here . i really recommend this film for everyone . judy is breathtaking in this role !
i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake . he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen . and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film . he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before . the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all . i did not know what to expect from jewel 's performance but i think she did rather well . lots of exciting scenes . a thoroughly good ride . i am absolutely a fan of maguire 's . check out cider house rules . one of the all time best ever .
10/10 for this film . i 'm a british india doctor , currently in india . the word beckham put me off , 'cos i 'm a die hard liverpool fan , and personally think that owen is really cool . since liverpool and man utd are rivals , i was dead sure that i would n't watch the film . but then i was in delhi to meet some friends , and i had an early morning flight , so i thought , `` what the heck , let 's bide time by watching this film '' , 'cos it was a late night show . what a moron i was . i should 've seen this film the day it was released . i guess using beckham 's name was to draw audience attraction ( which had back-fired in my case ! ! ! ) , but then i really ca n't think of a better title for the film . and nagra , knightley ( drop dead gorgeous ) , and rhys-myers did a superb job . if you hate football , dislike manchester united ( or england for that matter ) , then this is definately the film for you . in fact , i 'm just 29 yrs old , a psychiatrist by profession , but a kid at heart . this film has knocked `` star wars '' off my no.1 position . surprisingly , there are n't very many comments on this film by indian-brits like me . i wonder why ? 10/10 for this film .
-kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you 're rich then you 'll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe . a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita . at first , their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while , creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father/daughter relationship . one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process . when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice . -keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it . i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right . the only problem is the annoying visual style , which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott . i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i 'm sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it 's been possessed by demons . i would n't have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it 's spread through out the whole movie then that 's when we have some problems . the same annoying style was recently used on `` domino '' and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie . -another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images . somehow , williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i 'm sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better . the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience , it rather makes you feel like you 're being punished . the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it . i do n't know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie . -the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals . little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart . if the end of the movie does n't make anyone cry then they 're dead on the inside . denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily , for him he gets to play a great character . the whole idea of a man that 's lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character . i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge . radha mitchell plays marc anthony 's wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i ca n't hate the movie too much . j.lo 's husband comes and goes in the movie but he does n't really stand out much . mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact . -one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie . a little too late for that if you ask me . let 's hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this .
there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former . this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience . it presents a simple story , told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going , then just gets better and better . clooney 's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own . likeable and funny , hilariously so towards the end , welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre .
a terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon , and in the process of trying to escape , he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised . soldiers are able to retrieve the case , but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out . they eventually make it to where he 's hiding , and `` cleanse '' the hotel and its occupants . unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation , and if you 've seen return of the living dead , you know what happens next . zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike , as a complete mess of a movie . while that 's a fair assessment , it 's not without it 's high points . for one thing , it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore-hounds happy . there 's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible . they 're in the water , the rafters of houses , hiding in trees , and for some reason , they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush , only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape . there 's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator . you have to see it to believe it , as that scene alone makes zombi 3 required viewing imo . it may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting , especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors i 've seen , but zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie . sometimes it 's nice to sit back and watch a movie that does n't require anything more than your time and an open mind . zombi 3 fits that bill , and then some . it 's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers , and watch it with some like minded friends . i give it an 8/10 , just because of sheer enjoyment .
this time around , blackadder is no longer royal ( or even particularly close to being any such thing ) ... instead , rather a butler to the prince regent , portrayed by hugh laurie ( who replaces tim mcinnerny , who presence is sorely missed , and that hole is never filled ... his character had an innocent charm ... while he was a bumbling and complete moron , we ca n't help but care for him , which is n't at all true of his replacement ) as being intolerably daft ( which he apparently was , according to the trivia page ) , not to mention loud-mouthed and utterly non-threatening . edmund can now do just about what he pleases , and does so . why is he so frustrated and angry ( honestly , it gets depressing at times ) ? yes , his master is a buffoon , they always are . he does n't seem to lack money , nor is he in any danger . in the second series , the queen was mischievous and childish , and would cut off someone 's head - or marry them - on a whim . here there is simply never enough at stake for any of the conflict to be exciting and interesting . there is still commentary and even a little satire . too often , it seems as if they thought that the history was funny enough on its own , so they merely restate it , not bothering to actually turn the facts into jokes or gags . and i ca n't tell you how many of them i figured out before they were done , literally more than a minute away . it 's not usually a positive when you know the punchline before it is delivered . baldrick does n't change from last season ... he 's still rather pathetic and stupid , leading to `` silly '' humor . frankly , the amount goes through the roof . do n't get me started on the gross-out stuff . the sarcastic , verbal wit can still be great , though much less of it is than before . i 'd say about half of the episodes were rather amusing and downright funny , while the other three did n't really get me into them at all . i was disappointed in how predictable some of the plots and developments thereof were ... i could see many of such coming a mile away . some of the material tries way too hard to be funny and winds up coming across as incredibly forced . this continues with the tradition started by `` ii '' of letting the plans work out occasionally . the theme is the worst of the bunch , the credits sequences the least creative . all in all , this is , by far , my least favorite of the four . i recommend it to fans of the franchise and of british comedy in general . 7/10
hold your man finds jean harlow , working class girl from brooklyn falling for con man clark gable and getting in all kinds of trouble . the film starts out as his film , but by the time it 's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character . the film opens with gable pulling a street con game with partner , garry owen and the mark yelling for the cops . as he 's being chased gable ducks into harlow 's apartment and being he 's such a charming fellow , she shields him . before long she 's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets . gable , harlow , and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst , but then gable wo n't go through with it . of course when hurst realizes it was a con , he 's still sore and gets belligerent and gable has to punch him out . but then he winds up dead outside harlow 's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify . she goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter . the rest of the film is her 's and her adjustment to prison life . her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes . i think some of the material was later used for the mgm classic caged . harlow also gets to do the title song and it 's done as torch style ballad , very popular back in those days . she talk/sings it in the manner of sophie tucker and quite well . gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience , a part he 'd play often , most notably in my favorite gable film , honky tonk . still it 's harlow who gets to shine in this film . i think it 's one of the best she did at mgm , her fans should not miss it .
despite what others had said ( * cough * ) , this is my favourite movie of all time . i do n't know how long i had been waiting to see it , but once i finally did , i immediately fell in love . sure , it 's strange , but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour . for those who do n't know , moonchild is one of gackt and hyde 's first movies . they have n't done very many at all , maybe 3 or 4 tops each . so , give them some credit . we all know that adam sandler was n't the best at first either . i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there , but i over look that to find the best points of this movie , the emotions displayed and whatnot . therefore , i have given , and always shall give , this movie a 10 out of 10 .
this is an almost action-less film following jack , an insomniac , as he goes through hallucinations , is visited by dead friends , throws himself off a building , and , for a lot of the time , ca n't tell reality from hallucination . dominic monaghan , as jack , is truly believable . confused , and scared but lethargic and , at times blankly accepting of what he sees , we follow him trying to sort out what he 's seeing and find a way to sleep . introduce a talking dog ( another hallucination ) and children that suddenly appear in jack 's bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there ( more hallucination ) and you have an interesting , mind boggling , 43 minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more .
i love this movie/short thing . jason steele is amazing ! my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells `` spoons ! '' i crack up every time . i would recommend this movie to knox klaymation fans , and people who enjoy jason steele 's other movies . his style of animation is very original . it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds . his humor is also hilarious , and is definitely not something you 'd hear before . like max the deformed spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life . this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where .
though i really did n't feel anything for lance 's character , and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else . it could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development , perhaps with lance- i would have liked it better . however , i have to completely agree with doyleluver , when they said `` and to quote glenn quinn 's character ben : ' i 'm the star here in it , that 's right i 'm the talented one ! ' '' if you watch the movie , just watch him , even when he 's in the background ... just his facial expressions , all in the eyes , you know for sure what motivates ben , exactly how he feels about comments , even if it 's a quick look behind a character 's back . great acting in a fair film .
people forget that there have been several king kong ripoffs- congo , king kong vs. godzilla , king kong ( 1976 ) , they all ripoff one another , but yeti stands on its own . it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal 's attraction with one female . the yeti myth is based on bigfoot ( not like king kong ) and archeologists have been fascinated it , at one time they did exist , but there is no scientific data to prove it . this movie is hard to find , but its worth watching it . the first time i watched it was on `` elvira 's mistress of the dark shows '' in the early 1980 's . it sent chills down my spine as a kid , especially when the yeti got mad . i saw it again , around 1:00am on abc about 2 to 3yrs ago . seeing it again made me appreciate it more , it has some overall good effects ( for its time ) and the story involves a mute boy and his dog , and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes . also the music is pretty cool , its very yeti like . : - ) gianfranco parolini and the yetians creates a great monster like atmosphere . vote 7 and half out of 10 .
this was a hit in the south by southwest ( sxsw ) film festival in austin last year , and features a fine cast headed up by e.r . 's gloria reuben , and a scenery-chewing john glover . though shot on a small budget in nyc , the film looks and sounds fabulous , and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call `` the scottish play , '' as a reference to the word `` macbeth '' is thought to bring on the play 's ancient curse . the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself , lust , jealousy , rage , suspicion , and a bit of fun as well . the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced ( in the lead role ) by a well-known `` pretty face '' from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds . the green-eyed monster takes over from there , and the drama unfolds nicely . fine soundtrack , and good performances all around . the dvd includes director 's commentary and some deleted scenes as well .
`` the garden of allah '' is a prime example of `` popular women 's literature '' , turn of the xxth century style , combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of catholic guilt . just as jane eyre could n't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins , or the heroine of `` rebecca '' could n't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife ( and her castle burned down around her ) , or poor psyche could n't leave well enough alone and had to extract cupid 's secret at all costs , domini , the devout catholic heroine of this piece of tripe , can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows . like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours , this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book : basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one 's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late . the logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act . it is paul claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards . oh well ... it could have been much worse and it often was ... without the religious overtones , the film 's plot is that of your basic porn flick : oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic , shapely but naive catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery , all passion spent , leaving her to clean up his mess . and i really resent another commentator 's comparison with anatole france 's `` thais '' , a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of catholic sexual repression , some of which transpired in massenet 's opera of the same name , thankfully . but what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism , of course , is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering , vibrant life . imperishable technicolor photography that will outlive us all , a truckload of worthy character actors ( including one cute dog ) , a music score by max steiner that seems determined to accomplish the `` composed film '' that michael powell ( who , ironically , had a bit part in the 1927 silent version ) always dreamed about , tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic , operatic exoticism , a dream-like atmosphere where material considerations are no object , characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next , dialog is sparse , vague and suggestive , the art direction is close to celestial , flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent , the heroine 's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats , saints , doomed but horny sinners , mystics or poets . ahh ... hollywood ! the mgm dvd presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable . the bit rate is very high throughout , the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to max steiner 's score and to boyer 's penultimate confession . a historical note on this sort of `` women 's subject '' : the following year ( 1937 ) , julien duvivier , visibly inspired by `` the garden of allah '' , directed `` carnet de bal '' , where a very similar clothes-horse butter-won't-melt-in-her-mouth heroine ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic alpine lakeside villa ) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book . she finds them all in time , only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood , overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences . it was duvivier 's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later .
in all honesty , if someone told me the director of lemony snicket 's series of unfortunate events , city of angels , and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and that 'd it be real good , i 'd say that person must be joking . but that 's what director brad siberling did . and it was really good . `` 10 items or less '' has a similar conceit to films like `` before sunrise , '' `` lost in translation , '' or more recently `` once . '' it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity did n't put them there , they 'd probably never cross paths , or if they did , they would n't say word one to each other . like those films , `` 10 items or less '' focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each other 's strengths and weaknesses . the story involves morgan freeman , playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control , ends up spending the day with the lady in the 10 items or less lane played by paz vega . she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary . initially , freeman 's character just needs a lift home . after spending time with her , however , he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advice . brad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega . the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the film 's 80 minute duration . freeman has fun with his character , as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vega 's character , scarlett , inhabits . vega , in the meantime , grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her life 's situation looking to move on . there a couple things that really stood out in this film . first of all , siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and does n't fall into any hollywood pitfalls . it 's a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film . it works , even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivable . i am also impressed with the performances . while freeman 's presence gives this film credibility from the get-go , he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him . paz vega , meanwhile , is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future . i loved her in spanglish and she 's equally good here as the tough , no-nonsense scarlet . towards the end of the film , she successfully conveys the growth of her character . i 'm looking forward to seeing her in more films . overall , 10 items of less functions best as a character piece , well scripted and directed by brad siberling . he has n't done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films . yet there 's certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if he 'll take this road again .
a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors , such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono . after 15 minutes of watching , your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters . this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience , it takes you in , it makes you a part of the story ... costumes and settings are brilliant ; especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built . it is definitely not very akira kurosawa , however it still gets a lot from the master , especially the stylistic story telling tells us we 're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance .
this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry , and a light eccentric character study as well . the pacing is a bit slow for a comedy , and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny , except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments . but it does have its amusing moments , and it is very deft in its execution . the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element . the union procedures are quite droll , very reminiscent of i 'm all right jack ; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness ' character . the political machinations actually carry the story . ernest thesigner is very notable as a heavy . i do n't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers , or kind hearts and coronets ; but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing .
caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for . many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it did n't like it as it was not what they wanted to see . the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you 're a fan of the genre . it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself . an absolute diamond , a film i still have on video to this day . check it out .
i feel very sorry for people who go to movies with a pad and pencil to write down flaws and keep notes on how bad a movie is . i feel equally contempt for people who go to movies and ca n't suspend reality and/or let themselves enjoy 90 minutes aways from their boring or busy lives ! get a grip people . ecgtb is a very entertaining movie . if you take movies seriously , this is not for you . if you are expecting the movie to resemble the book in any way , this is not for you . but if you enjoyed the utter hilarity of priscilla queen of the desert , or the `` what the hell am i watching '' of moulin rouge . or the gross out comedy of `` the sweetest thing '' then let yourself escape to cowgirls . it has some really funny parts . hilarious actually . it also has some really good music ; kudos to kd.lang . also did i mention it has 90 minutes of uma thurman ..... need i say more ?
this early anime movie was a rather good film that i caught once on the science fiction channel when anime was actually popular here in america and not the ratings disaster that adult swim claims it is on the cartoon network . i quite frankly think it has less to do with it being less popular and more with the fact people would rather now buy dvds are watch the episodes uncut on the internet . this film though probably did not have all that many cuts and the voice work was okay for a dubbed movie , though i would rather watch the original japanese version . americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything dubbed . this film features a young boy who boards a train called the galaxy express in the hopes that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to turn him into a robot . he wishes to become a robot to avenge his mother , who was brutally murdered at the hands of a robot who hunts humans for fun . during the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train as well as a woman that resembles his deceased mother , a beautiful woman named matel , who as with most woman in anime movies has a secret that could either be really good for our young hero , or really bad . he goes from planet to planet too as the train makes various stops and he runs into a space pirate named captain harlock who apparently starred in his own animated cartoon series , so basically the galaxy express takes place in that universe . all in all a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected ending . there would be a sequel to this one , but it was not quite as good as this one , however the ending was a bit more final than it was here .
if you like mech war games it 's pretty good . some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing . i 've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i 've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs . if you like the genera then games you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and $ 350 to spare steel battalion . the movie is worth seeing at least once . there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there . less remakes and more original works . enjoy
i have to agree with cal-37 it 's a great movie , specially for the family , kelly linch is beautiful , the little girl is really talented and cute , of course jim belushi has earned his strips ! but want i really liked was the piano song , if you 're a musician or not watch this movie just for that , you 'll know which it is . `` you 're nobody till somebody loves you '' written by russ morgan , larry stock , and james cavanaugh so have fun watching see ya , nelson
melvyn douglas once more gives a polished performance in which , this time , he inhabits the role of a detective who ca n't place love before duty and adventure , and the warmly beautiful joan blondell ( who , far from being illiterate , as one reviewer suggested , wrote a novel about her early life ) is as enjoyable as ever as his ever-suffering sweetheart.it 's almost a screwball comedy , almost a thin man-type movie , almost a series , i guess , that did n't quite make it to a sequel . it does n't quite reach classic status , but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script , fine character actors , and direction that keeps it all moving fast enough so that you nearly do n't notice that williams ( douglas ) is n't exactly columbo when it comes to detecting . i wish there were more films like this .
i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday . the episode with hilton 's eccentric genius brother , george ( played by the late roscoe lee browne ) , is classic hilarity . it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy . mr. cosby and ms. rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists . the roster of comedic dynamite ... madeline kahn , phylicia rashad , and mr. cosby ... classic genius !
this documentary was interesting , but it was also long ( so long it lasts a total of 225 minutes ) , like ben-hur long . but if your into that , this is for you . but only if you have a passion for movies , like i do . being that martin scorsese is my favorite director ( live and maybe even ever ) , this is quite fascinating , especially if you know the style of scorsese 's works . because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films . not the best documentary film ever made , but it is a leap for scorsese , which is always good to watch . a
every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap , another plot twist comes along . best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one . most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve ( which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw ) , this movie has a great deal more to recommend it . sidney bruhl ( michael caine ) is a very unhappy man . once a successful playwright , his last several plays on broadway have flopped . and while his wife myra ( dyan cannon ) is nothing but supportive , in both the monetary and emotional sense , this does little to make sidney feel any better . to add insult to injury , young playwright , clifford anderson ( christopher reeve ) , has just sent sidney a play to look at . it 's anderson 's first , and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer . he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over , kill him , and submit the play as his own . she laughs with him at first , but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner , she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action . and her fears just may be justified ... it 's a brilliant script . there are twists and turns all through the plot , and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end . it 's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning , and keeps you there the entire time . an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery . the acting is excellent . caine gives his usual excellent performance , and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured , refined , and intellectual men . reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who is n't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems . cannon 's franticness works well for myra . and irene worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic . this is a film with an ending you 'd never expect , and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings . an unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time - and that is a real shame .
mpaa : rated r for violence , language , nudity and brief drug use . quebec rating:13+ canadian home video rating:18a i saw coonskin today.this film is also known as bustin out and street fight.after watching fritz the cat , i wanted to see more of bashki 's films.i saw cool world and thought it was mediocre and i saw this.when it was first released , the film was very controversial.it was considered racist and al sharpton wanted the film banned , he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing.the film was only released on vhs under the title `` street fight '' .it is now considered a cult-classic film and african-american celebrities such as comedian richard pryor , director spike lee and the rap group the wu-tang clan are said to have enjoyed this film.i personally thought fritz the cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well.worth watching for bashki or blaxploitation film fans.the film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film who framed roger rabbit.i would have preferred it in full animation but whatever.the film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison.while the prisoners wait , the older one tells a story of three men he knew.the film then switches into animation format , we see three black men who sold their house to this man.they decide to make names for themselves in harlem.so the leader , a black rabbit , kills a big player in harlem and he basically becomes a big shot.the film moves on as the italian mafia want him out.the mafia involves the godfather , his three sons who are homosexual and an italian clown.coonskin is an entertaining animated film that 's worth checking out , if you can find it .
i 've seen this movie after watching paltrow 's version . i 've found that one a very good one , and i thought this would not be as good ... but i was wrong : british version was far better and enjoyable ! i found jeremy northam more `` agreeable '' than mark strong , but i can say that strong catches much better austen 's knightley . anyway , both versions are good , but anyone that loved austen 's books , should watch this movie . i agree with * caalling * : andrew davies changed a few things , but still remains faithful to the original . 10 out of 10 my 2 cents !
eva ( hedy lamarr ) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon , she realizes that her husband does not desire her . her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love , makes eva returning to her father 's home in a farm , leaving her husband . one afternoon , while bathing in a lake , her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva . they fall in love for each other and become lovers . later , her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home . eva refuses , and fortune leads the trio to the same place , ending the affair in a tragic way . i have just watched `` extase '' for the first time , and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network : the movie has only 75 minutes running time , and it seems that it was used different reels of film . there are some parts totally damaged , and other parts very damaged . therefore , the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer , if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale . the film is practically a silent movie , the story is very dated and has only a few lines . consequently , the characters are badly developed . however , this movie is also very daring , with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty . another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers , symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover . the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear . the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie . i liked this movie , but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version . my vote is eight . title ( brazil ) : `` êxtase '' ( `` ecstasy '' )
i first watched this movie on its release in 1987 and was greatly affected emotionally , through a combination of guilt at what my fellow white human beings could do to innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against man . particularly moving was the funeral of steve biko , made even more vivid and hard-hitting by the south african anthem played at the time . i have long believed that this movie achieved what nobody else had managed - to open the eyes of the world to what was really happening in south africa . i consider myself to be a normal right thinking person and i can attest to how this film changed my whole way of thinking about not just south africa , but how we as white people perceive black people . i have never seen any difference between people of any colour or creed , but after viewing this film i physically changed my life and have spent the last 17 years living in a predominantly black country and helping many people rise above their present standard of living and achieve that which they would not have thought possible . the greatest reward i can honestly say i have received - to be able to say that in my own small way i have contributed and redressed the balance a little . but if more people thought like me and actually did something to help black people without seeking reward then the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off . i challenge any right thinking person to watch cry freedom from beginning to end and not feel that emotion tugging at your heartstrings as you witness the 700 schoolchildren brutally shot dead in sharpville for refusing to learn afrikaans , the senseless murder of steve biko , such a champion for his own people 's rights , and then , ultimately , to understand that all this is not merely a film , albeit a magnificent one , but that it all actually happened and less than 30 years ago . yes , my friends , watch this movie and then see if you can go out afterwards and party hard . i could n't . i was too upset at knowing the truth . that is the hallmark of a great film . it was obviously the intention of sir richard attenborough to get this message over about south africa . of course he has achieved it . unless you happen to support apartheid . god help you .
it was a doubly interesting experience . for some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th century had never been the central figure in a movie * . the closest i can think of as films with einstein in them are champaign for caesar , where ( like a `` deus ex ma-china '' ) the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show , so that ronald colman is proved to have given the correct answer after all , and in bullshot where the great albert is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain , intent on stealing some machines of theirs . it is notable that in those two cases , and in iq , we are dealing with comedies . so far nobody has tried to do a serious film about the life of einstein , like john huston 's attempt to do one on freud with montgomery cliff . i guess it is just too hard to get the world of mathematical equations or the secrets of electro-magnetic field theory into exciting dialog . but then , only three years ago russell crowe and christopher plummer did a beautiful mind . maybe nobody really has tried . ( * subsequently , after writing this , i remembered the successful comedy young einstein with yahoo serious about ten years ago . but that is an exception and it was a spoof . ) the other surprise was the actor playing the great albert . it was walter matthau , here taking time away from the series of films he did with jack lemmon in that last decade of their careers . matthau was a highly capable and gifted character actor , in both comedy and drama , but normally his comic personas were variants of his `` whiplash willie '' gingrich from the fortune cookie . they were connivers and gonifs . later they would shed their criminal propensities because we had grown to like them , but they remained grumpy types . but his albert einstein happens to be genuinely sweet . more like his kotch than like willie clarke . he plays albert as good old uncle albert . it seems that matthau 's einstein is living in princeton with his niece catherine boyd ( meg ryan ) , and she is seeing a stuffy professor named james morland ( stephen fry ) . but fry 's car needs repairs , and they take it to the auto shop where ed walters ( tim robbins ) works . robbins falls for ryan , who is attracted to him - but finds that he lacks the mental equipment that she admires . good old uncle albert , aided by his three friends ( lou jacobi , joseph maher , and gene saks ) decide to give their assistance to robbins and make him an apparently unrecognized physics genius . this will open the doors of romance between him and ryan , provided ryan is impressed and fry does not spoil things ( as he hopes to do ) . the atmosphere is sweet , as when matthau and his chums rig up a super physics quiz that they help robbins cheat on ( by switching the positions of their bodies ) . the plot eventually leads to the outright lie that the brilliant robbins has constructed an atomic powered rocket ship - which brings in the interests of the nation in the figure of president eisenhower ( keene curtis ) . it was a charming comedy , and an interesting stretch for matthau in that he was not as hyper as normal , but far more subdued .
this is one of the best movies i 've ever seen . it has very good acting by hanks , newman , and everyone else . definitely jude law 's best performance . the cinematography is excellent , the editing is about as good , and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie . the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special . to me , it takes a lot to beat godfather , but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest . definitely a best picture nominee in my book .
why did this movie fail commercially ? it 's got a sharp script ( by ron shelton ) and great performances by kurt russell and , especially , robin williams , in a brilliant manic nerd turn that 's different from any of his other work . a great renter .
this is an interesting series that takes real life people ( jesse james , john wesley hardin , etc ) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story . railroad detective `` matt clark '' -- takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts . in that sense , it 's almost an anthology series , and as someone else pointed out , this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events , but it 's a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western-hungry 1950 's audience -- and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later . clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of history 's baddest baddies . and his girl-sidekick frankie is quite a dish . if you 're a western fan , be sure to check it out if you have a chance .
d.w. griffith could have made any film he wanted to after the enormous financial success of 'the birth of a nation ' ; he chose to make the most technically ambitious film to that date , 'intolerance . ' he took a risk with such innovations in film montage and form , and the well-known financial train wreck resulted . buster keaton does n't take that kind of a risk with 'three ages , ' a parody of 'intolerance . ' this is keaton 's first feature-length film of his own ( he only acted in 'the saphead ' ) . he had the fallback plan of dividing the three episodes in this film into three separate shorts , which griffith did do with 'intolerance . ' keaton did n't have to . chaplin had already succeeded with feature-length comedies , so if keaton was taking a risk here , it was completely calculated . chaplin had already done a parody of another film , too , with 'burlesque on carmen ' ( 1915 ) . keaton appears to allude to that film , as well . the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplin 's film . the comical distance from the plot of both scenes is the same , too . furthermore , chaplin 's film imitated the glossy style of demille 's 'carmen , ' and chaplin 's film seemed a tribute to that film . keaton does n't attempt the radical editing , narrative structure or monumental nature in his parody , but it seems respectful of 'intolerance ' nonetheless . at least , the stories are n't told completely straightforward as in other post-'intolerance ' films , such as dreyer 's 'leaves from satan 's book ' ( blade af satans bog , 1921 ) and fritz lang 's 'destiny ' ( der müde tod , 1921 ) . there is some mild jumping back and forth between episodes . where keaton did take risks , however , is in his physical , daredevil comedy . that 's keaton unintentionally failing to jump across buildings in the modern episode . reportedly , he was convinced to alter the scene rather than attempt the jump again . and , it was n't just keaton who took risks ; the anachronistic baseball gag , for example , was rather dangerous . thus , although in a different way , keaton , like griffith , took risks with his big film . and , i think they both succeeded .
the absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty dane douglas sirk ( born detlef sierck ) , written on the wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame . from its justly famous opening sequence , with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback , the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later , little-screen knockoffs as dallas , dynasty and falcon crest over their years-long runs . the combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme americans , in our dollar-based society , find irresistible . brother and sister robert stack and dorothy malone are the spoiled , troubled heirs to the hadly oil fortune ; boyhood chum rock hudson and new bride lauren bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron . ( it 's been rumored that the story was based on libby holmann 's marriage into reynolds tobacco money . ) as always , the misfits get all the scenery to chew -- and the best lines to spit out ( malone , in her oscar-nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for hudson , gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them ) . hudson , while good , ca n't compete with all this over-the-top emoting ; bacall starts out strong but grows recessive , a mere plot convenience . no matter ; with a succession of set-pieces shot in extravagant hues , sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s america . nobody ever did it better .
almost every review of this movie i 'd seen was pretty bad . it 's not pretty bad , it 's actually pretty good , though not great . the judy garland character could have gotten annoying , but she did n't allow it to . somewhere along the line , i 've become a fan of brooding , overbearing , overacting van heflin , at least in the early 40 's . judy 's singing is great , but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship . i gave it a 7 .
the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour . it incorporates world war two into the plot but not as much as i initially believed it would , and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well . askey , playing the role of tommy gander , is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or `` dragging '' . the story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards . it is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is the ghost train . gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well . he is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being `` annoying '' but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940 's humour . his humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watch . if it was not for askey/gander , than this film would of been shorter in action , enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion .
`` 9/11 , '' hosted by robert deniro , presents footage from outside and inside the twin towers in new york , on september 11 , 2001 . never too grisly and gory , yet powerful and moving . `` 9/11 '' is a real treat . anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything . 5/5 stars --
the cure is an amazing film ... so suspenseful and just so real ! i was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'the cure ' at it 's nyc premiere and it completely blew me away ! i also heard it won an award from that particular festival , and it definitely deserved it . the first thing that struck out at me was the cinematography . eric giovon did an amazing job . the shooting style of the love scene halfway into the film was amazing . a love scene was necessary in this film , and jafri got the point across but also kept the scene tasteful . giovon and jafri make an excellent creative team and they should definitely work together on future projects . judy maier 's narration was so surreal but simultaneously heart wrenching , it made me feel what the main character felt . i 'm a very tough critic but i must say the cure is one of my favorite films .. just love it ! if you have n't seen it yet , check it out !
contains spoilers ! i saw an advert for this on a video.then my sister discovered that we had the book so i read it.i rented the video on the same day i finished the book.i thought it was very memorable as was the book . the cast was brilliant.tara fitzgerald was excellent as helen and rupert graves was hateful as arthur.the costumes , music and settings are stunningly beautiful . warning ! don ` t read any more if you haven ` t watched this on the downside there are some sex scenes that have been added in and some violence.this is why the video is rated 15 . there are some other things that have been thrown in.after the first part , i felt that the accuracy went downhill . while the book is better than this , i am glad i have seen it and would reccomend it to people who have read the book , are fans of bronte or like costume dramas ( i am all 3 ! ) as long as you fastforward through the sex scenes . the book is rather underated.anne brontes books don ` t seem to be that widely read or well known as jane erye or wuthering heights which have made it into television and film several times . another thing.when i read the book , i was surprised at how much religion ther was in it , but here they had axed that all out ! 7\10
it 's a bit easy . that 's about it . the graphics are clean and realistic , except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d , but that 's forgiveable . the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n64 games . the sounds are magnificant . everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic . the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times , but it 's the same for every platform game , like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong 64 . i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 , and since then , i have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times .
this schiffer guy is a real genius ! the movie is of excellent quality and both entertaining and educating . i did n't know what a weather girl was before i learned it here .
the ogre is a film made for tv in italy and was n't intended to be a sequel to demons as lamberto bava even mentions it on the interview on the sheirk show dvd , but it was called demons iii to be part of the demons series . the music in demons and demons 2 was 80 's rock music while this is more creepy music and while the first two was gory horror demons iii : the ogre is a architectural horror so that 's how demons iii is n't a proper sequel to demons but i still like this film . the music is creepy and that adds a tone to the castle that the film is set in , the ogre is another thing why i like the film . there are two other films that are classed as demons iii and that is black demons ( demoni 3 ) and the church ( demons 3 ) . demons iii : the ogre is a good film as long as you do n't compare it with demons and demons 2 .
this is the best series of its type i 've seen all year . i ca n't help thinking it 's just my luck - a series i love gets 6 episodes ( and more next year ) and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending episodes . i think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many . the scripts are good , and the mix of characters superb , the acting is top flight , and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat . the stories are n't all that memorable , but that 's not the reason i watch shows like this one . the theme song is a favourite , and we were disappointed to find it is n't available in any published edition . great stuff , bbc- a triumph of sense over sex-appeal ( aside from the young constable nobody 's there as eye-lolly , and even if he is , he can still act ! ) .
this show was absolutely great , and i always look forward to watching it.all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way , each and every episode provided non-stop laughter , and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows.everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny , that you could n't help but love this show.there were a few dead weight episodes , but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere , to where it just really did n't matter.this was one of the best shows to ever be aired , and i will watch this show anytime i can , for it never gets old , never gets unfunny , and never gets uninteresting .
maria braun got married right in the middle of combat all around her and her husband hermann . an explosion ripped through the building , to begin with , and she and hermann had to sign the papers on a pile of rubble on the street . perhaps this may strike some as a heavy-handed metaphor for what 's about to come : marriage on the rocks , so to speak . it 's a betrothal where the husband goes off to war and is held in a russian prison camp , unbenownst to the helpless but hopeful and proud maria , who keeps standing by the depressing rubble of the train station as some come home , others do n't , with a sign awaiting hermann . trouble arises , as happens in rainer werner fassbinder 's melodramas , and as its one of his best and most provocative , we see as maria ( uncommonly gorgeous hanna schygulla in this role ) will do a two-face : she 'll stand by her man , even if it means working at a bar for american gi 's and , even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black gi and comes close to bearing his child ( that is , naturally , until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe ) , or working for a german businessman ( effectively sympathetic ivan desny ) and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company . maria will do whatever it takes to be successful , but she 'll always be married . it 's hard to say there 's anything about maria that is n't fascinating . money , sex , power , all of these become interchangeable for maria . she 's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile : she gets to have a husband , more or less ( actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film ) while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can , a new and expensive house with servants , a secretary , money- that others around her are n't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere ( such as the secretary , played interestingly enough by fassbinder 's own mother ) . maria is sexy , confident , and all alone , with an idealized life going against a life that should be made in the shade . she says of the two men- the american soldier and poor old and sick oswald- that she 's fond of them , and at the same time will stick by those roses the confused and soul-searching husband hermann sends from canada , after being released from prison . she 's casts a profile that a feminist would love to trounce , but understand where she 's coming from and going all the way . fassbinder employs this inherent contradiction , and moments with maria appear to go against the conventions of a melodrama ( for example , hermann walking in on the jubilant and half-naked maria and gi is just about a masterpiece of a scene , with maria 's reaction not of surprise or guilt but pure happiness to see that he 's there let alone alive ) , while sticking to his guns as a director of such high-minded technique with a storyline that should be predictable . but it is n't really . it 's like one big metaphor for a country that , after the war , could n't really move on to normalcy . a few times fassbinder puts sound of the radio on in the background , and we see maria walking around her family house , hustle and bustle going on around her , and the radio speaks of a divided germany , of things still very unsettled , of a disarray . maybe the only way to cope is excess , or maybe that 's just my interpretation of it . it 's hard to tell , really , under schygulla 's stare face and eyes , anyway . it 's such an incredible performance , really , one of those showstoppers that captures the glamor and allure of an old-time hollywood female star while with the down-and-dirty ethic of a girl of the streets . most telling are the opposing costumes one sees in one scene when she finally is with her husband , where she stars in one of those super-lustful black lingerie pieces and high heels , and then moves on to a dress without even thinking about it . that 's almost the essence of what maria is , and schygulla wonderfully gets it down , a headstrong but somehow loving figure who is adored and perplexed by the men around her , sometimes in a single sentence . this is what fassbinder captures in his wonderful first part of his `` trilogy '' ; while i might overall prefer veronika voss as a masterpiece , maria braun is perhaps just as good as a character study , of what makes a woman tick and tock with ( almost ) nothing to lose .
a number of posters have commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion . this is always a problem with long , complex dramas . crime is essentially banal , so the pay off is always anti-climactic , whilst detailed exposition detracts from the human drama . the writer has used a number of clever devices to try and get round this , but has not been entirely successful . answers to precisely what happened and why may have been supplied , but if so they are well buried . the viewer inevitably feels a little cheated . but in a sense this is unimportant . the drama was never about the crime , or even the investigation , it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved ; the family , the investigators , the witnesses , the press . and as such it was gripping . the writing was a significant cut above the run of the mill for prime-time drama , and the performances uniformly good . in an ensemble piece it is invidious to focus on individuals , but penelope wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother-wife-daughter , and janet mcteer was in cracking form as a hard-bitten old cop . one of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race , as the elephant in the room that no-one is prepared to mention . subtle , powerful stuff .
fearful symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults . the first thing about the episode is that it takes place near mountain home air force base in southwest idaho . season one 's 'deep throat ' takes place near ellens air base , also in southwest idaho . i 'm wondering if the air force bases are one and the same but they decided to use the real name in fearful symmetry . mulder and scully have some good dialog , always a plus . ed meecham , the zoo keeper , reminds me of cranky , old school teachers . they must have liked children at one time , you just ca n't imagine how . just like he must have cared more for animals at one point . i liked the concept of the episode , but i felt it had some inconsistencies . if aliens are so adept at abducting humans and returning them safely , why ca n't they put the animal back in the right place ? and the aliens are just now having problems returning the animals ? i do n't buy mulder 's theory of a problem with the space-time continuum . as if he 's an expert on that . i also thought jayne atkinson 's performance as willa ambrose was not well done . besides those nitpicks , i still enjoyed this episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens harvesting animal dna as well as human dna .
taking old collection of stories poses a challenge for the production team , how can this classic character be brought up to date and make it interesting enough to capture a new audience while stirring memories from her former audience . in my opinion , their mission was accomplished . a must see for young children , pre-teens , teens , and their parents . ok there are a couple scary moments that are resolved in short order , but parents with young children should sit tight , the movie moves on to better things . i am going to go with those astute user reviewers who point out that emma roberts provides us with a positive role model for young women , not syrupy about it either . nancy balances her femininity with career minded sleuthing skills . a lot to like in here , laughs , does n't take itself too seriously , a real mystery to solve ( one you can figure out yourself as an added bonus , and likable characters . nancy drew even makes a good date movie in my opinion .
i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy . i was n't sure i would like him this way . and i was n't sure he could pull it off . but this astounded me . he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people . the movie is engrossing and fast paced . bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy . the real talent here is thomas . the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that 's the way real people would fight ... if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad !
this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that i 've ever seen on screen . andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction . he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it 's primitive in a good sense . his purity , honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art . i was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end . sometimes prematurely , but his scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly . the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that goldsworthy 's art has . it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself . fred frith 's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound . this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect . it has no boundaries as far as age goes .
one of the most excellent movies ever produced in russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the ussr . incredibly clever , hilarious and dramatic at the same time . superb acting . overall a masterpiece . score it 10/10 .
whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i 've ever seen , i invariably reply `` black noon '' and to this day nobody 's ever heard of it . i watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening . as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhs . if anyone can trace a copy please let me know . if i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film !
having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers ' ratings i was most pleasantly surprised . although clearly low-budget , it bears the signs of clever ingenuity . for example , when julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window i found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location . and lo and behold ! the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water 's edge . there are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller . savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed . as to the performances , george macready is his usual creepy self , barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence . nina foch was surprisingly good as the no-nonsense working girl who 's not about to submit without a fight . but dame may witty , oh boy , she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes . this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed .
the third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear . it is a political film more than a plain entertainment . jason bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity : he really killed some one who became his corpse . but the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the cia within a blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all american citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people . who was one essential officer of the cia up to 1980 , when he became vice president ? that goes along with what is being said on the internet . then the truth will come thanks to jason bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the cia is a woman and that woman gets the senate involved in a general investigation . a woman and the senate ; read my lips . in the usa politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign : it is music and the cinema . right now hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia , academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general , and this film in particular , to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the senate . so go and watch the film . it is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for , but no one is able to pretend it wo n't come : the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines
one of the best true-crime movies ever made and very faithful to truman capote 's book which invented the true-crime novel genre . haunting quincy jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry , the killers . why wilson did n't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me . the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch . the re-creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination , even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off . the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders . the movie has a very documentary feel -- -besides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to . nancy clutter 's beloved horse , babe , is even in the movie . will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie . this is a solid movie , scary every time you see it .
this film is like an allegory of the gospel . it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was ravaged and devastated , and was filled with a huge homeless , impoverished population . it is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit , as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration . toto is a character like doestoevisky 's `` idiot '' , a modern christ finding his way in a big city . he is goodness and purity fortified by love , and his acts change the people he encounters , as much as the miracle working dove . the story is told in a natural manner and simple style , yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of fellini 's surrealist fantasies . it is one of the most inspiring , uplifting movies ever made .
de sica is becoming one of my favorite directors , but this one was a hit-and-miss for me . a grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside milano . it is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses , complete with evil capitalists and trigger-happy police forces , but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale , as the boy wonder toto develops unlimited superhero powers . i had it up to here with the ever-smiling toto after 10 minutes , and when the magic took over , i was left in the dust . there were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots , so many good characters among the settlers , that i kept thinking it was a waste the movie was n't more serious with its material . the coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the `` look-what-we-can-also-do-mum '' sort than as a fully developed piece of work/art .
this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'the prsoner of zenda ' . set in a london that only hollywood could manage , atmospheric but nothing like the real thing , it is a story of obsession and thwarted love , from the novel by somerset maughan . i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones . so i bought it . well she looked fine but i 'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh . bette davis was one of the greatest film actors , make no mistake , but here she did make one . it was impossible to take her character seriously . it was n't as gruesome as the dick van dyke 'mary poppins ' cockney accent but close . in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly . he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well . worth watching despite ms davis ' vocal gymnastics .
obsession comes in many flavors , and exists for a variety of reasons ; for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder , but for others it may be an avenue of survival . lack of nurturing , combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements , may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone . and in extreme cases , the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession , driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing , and as we discover in ` the luzhin defence , ' directed by marleen gorris , a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem , and in fact , may actually exacerbate the situation . obsession , it seems , has no prejudice or preference ; moreover , it gives no quarter . at an italian resort in the 1920 's , alexander luzhin ( john turturro ) is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament , the winner of which will be the world champion . luzhin is a master of the game , but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him ; rather , it is his obsession , that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life , and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family . so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel , a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands , and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament . that man is valentinov ( stuart wilson ) , luzhin 's former mentor , who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin . valentinov is an unwelcomed , disconcerting presence to luzhin , and once again life threatens to overwhelm him . not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament , turati ( fabio sartor ) , against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours , but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life -- his feelings for a young woman he 's just met at the resort , natalia ( emily watson ) . and , genius though he may be , dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace , as well the curse , of his entire life . to tell luzhin 's story , gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess . and as his background is established , it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life . for the scenes of his childhood , gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into , and underlies , the present , more pastoral setting of the resort . the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled , and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting , yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well . she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov , concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense , which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film , making luzhin 's tragedy all the more believable and unsettling . the single element that makes this film so memorable , however , is the affecting performance of john turturro . for this film to work , luzhin must be absolutely believable ; one false or feigned moment would be disastrous , as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately . it does n't happen , however , and the film does work , because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true-to-life . he captures luzhin 's genius , as well as his inadequacies , and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real . it 's a performance equal to , if not surpassing , geoffrey rush 's portrayal of david helfgott in ` shine . ' and when you compare his work here with other characters he 's created , from sid lidz in ` unstrung heroes ' to pete in ` o brother where art thou ? ' to al fountain in ` box of moonlight , ' you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor , and what a remarkable artist he truly is . as natalia , emily watson is excellent , as well , turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely . though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin , watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective . most importantly , because of the detail she brings to her performance , it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story . you have but to look into watson 's eyes to know that the feelings she 's conveying are real . it 's a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor . the supporting cast includes geraldine james ( vera ) , christopher thompson ( stassard ) , peter blythe ( ilya ) , orla brady ( anna ) , mark tandy ( luzhin 's father ) , kelly hunter ( luzhin 's mother ) , alexander hunting ( young luzhin ) and luigi petrucci ( santucci ) . well crafted and delivered , ` the luzhin defence ' is an emotionally involving film , presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon man 's inhumanity to man . we do n't need a movie , of course , to tell us that there is cruelty in the world ; but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget , inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change , and to make a difference in the lives of those around us . i rate this one 9/10 .
a fabulous film . with everything you could want in a film . huge battle scenes and lots of other action . suspense , and a romantic love story . kind of like an old swashbuckler film . totally entertaining from start to finish . the editing was fast and you are never bored for a second . the story is like a classic story of trouble in the royal household . the actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent . the costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative . the special effects are amazing too . gary stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at . he looks like a sure bet for super stardom . john rhys-davies is wonderful as he usually is . he is one of the great actors of our time . and cindy burbridge , ex miss thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady , even doing an english accent with remarkable success . i found out that the film has won numerous awards , and i can see why . all in all this is an amazing independent film . see it for sure . i highly recommend it . and give it a ten + ! ! !
fabulous film ! rented the dvd recently and was floored by this stunning piece of work . douglas sirk was a filmmaking genius and he gets performances out of rock hudson , dorothy malone ( oscar winner ) , robert stack ( oscar nominated ) , and lauren bacall that words can not describe . paul verhoeven brilliantly payed homage to this film by having dorothy malone play sharon stone 's murdering inspirational guru in his basic instinct . what a great joke ! by turns the film is hilarious , riveting , campy , biting , trashy , compelling , and eye rolling ! it 's definately the grandaddy of every tawdry big-and-little screen soap opera but none have had the dazzling style like you 'll see here : the camera work is smooth and polished , the use of color is breathtaking , the opening montage set to the title song is beyond memorable , the one dimensional characters are unforgettable , and the final image will have you scratching your head as to how the censors back then let it make the final cut ! while most older , highly regarded films can sometimes be a boring chore to sit through , written on the wind contains so much and goes by so fast that it 's actually a shame when it ends . thank you to mr. sirk for crafting -and todd haynes for drawing attention to- what has now become one of my favorite films of all time ! see this movie ! ! !
this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid . there is really not much i 'd need or want to say here . except maybe `` see this film '' and `` enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal '' , who carries you through this neat , funny and heartbreaking story about 'spending your eighth day ' - your own day ! seeing this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day = my life ! it appears , that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do . either if it 's pleasing a career or just consuming tv-shows and ballgames . what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference . about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - now ! ( on the eighth day ) ... at least that was what i got from 'the eighth day ' .
you play as b.j . blazkowicz , a us secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover nazi secret and turn the tide of world war ii . that means everything from breaking out of a nazi dungeon to thwarting hitler 's war machine and even the fuhrer himself . this is quite possibly the most influential game of its time . that 's because it literally inspired obsession . many games existed at the time and even more do today , but every so often you get a real grabber . this is one of them . just like tetris before it and more recently gta iii in 2002 . yes , doom is better in almost every respect , but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming 's biggest tidal waves were fired by b.j . blazkowicz . the space marine , duke nukem , max payne , serious sam , john mullins , jc denton , agent 47 , gordon freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at id . whether directly or , in most cases , indirectly , but they still do . even with its old look , very aged graphics , super simple gameplay ( this is really a game , games now border on the `` experience level '' ) and highly rectangular levels , the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun . especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them . also : `` halt ! '' * bang ! bang ! bang ! * `` aarrrgh ! ! ! '' never grows old . -- - 8/10 voluntarily rated pc-13 for `` profound carnage . '' however , it 's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today .
i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend . we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving . it was very well directed with strong imagery . the visual effects were amazing - especially for a short . it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic : this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father . there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard . this leans towards the gothic feel . i would love to see this as a full feature film . -- carrie
this film could well have been one of those ordinary `` soapies '' relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined .. broken relationships , building new friendships , street bashings , near accidents , hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes ! what a mixture of events ! fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers . he asks in this chaotic world do things just happen , is it just luck when things turn out right or , taking a fatalistic view , is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective ? most of us have had this uncanny experience . is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important ? as one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was . this is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships . danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role .
a documentary about two rocks bands , spanning a number of years . brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols . what makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure . anton newcombe , the main man of brian jonestown massacre , is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues , his friends and rivals the dandy warhols , but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him . sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world . newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan ) . newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments , writes and produces all bjm 's music , can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day , has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius , but is also a heavy drugs user , flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity , orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life , and can blow deals as fast as he makes them . bjm go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise newcombe 's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable . the warhols acknowledge their debt to newcombe 's creativity and do n't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the warhols have something that bjm do n't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense , the real world , and their market  as a mixing pot of talent ( even if much of it is distilled from guru newcombe ) and accessibility , they are the very definition of 'cool . ' dig ! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy . at one point , newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the warhols ( in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap 'to clean up their act ' )  only he forgets to tell them it 's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against newcombe . by the time the dandy warhols take off in europe with hits like 'every day should be a holiday ' and 'bohemian like you ' , newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated . bjm are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the warhols get busted for drugs around the same time , let off with a warning , and even allowed to keep the grass . the wider appeal of dig ! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music . the downside is that it is still a documentary , however intimate , and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands . newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius , and there are feint glimpses of this in the film , but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this . in the words of one of the band members : `` in every spiritual tradition , you burn in hell for pretending to be god and not being able to back it up . '' newcombe is n't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime , and dig ! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius .
first of all , do not call this a remake of the '63 film . even though this version is truer to the stage play , it is extremely long . the casting was good with some exceptions . chyna phillips was not a good casting choice . she was almost 30 when she did this film , and it was hard to believe she was a teenager . jason alexander was good choice , but after a while he gave me a headache . tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson . george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee , and showed he could even hold a tune . like the '63 film , they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie . marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed . i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing . so what made this a tv ratings flop ? it was lengthy for one . they put in new songs and scenes . even though some of the new songs were good ( like `` let 's settle down '' ) , was it really necessary ? now do n't get me wrong , i liked it , but i rather watch the '63 film ( see my review ) . this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles , making some changes , and once again , length . one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams . she does a good job with the role and the music . give her any lyrics and she could sing them . so here is my advice coming from someone who 's done a couple productions of bye bye birdie : if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play , watch the '63 film . if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play , watch the '95 version . just take it in moderation though . do n't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting .
artemisia gentileschi , the daughter of orazio gentileschi , showed an early promise as a painter . taught by her father , artemisia was born in an era that denied talented women the right to have their work seen side by side art created by men . her tragic life is chronicled in this biographic film directed and co-written by agnes merlik . having read the novel `` the passion of artemisia '' by susan vreeland , made us investigate more into the life of this woman , her work , and her legacy . we also read mary garrard 's `` artemisia gentileschi '' , which should be a must read book by all art lovers . `` artemisia '' presents the fictionalized facts we have read about showing the early life of the young woman as she starts to paint . she was clearly influenced by the work of her father , by caravaggio , agostino tassi , and other florentine painters of that period . her relationship and love affair with tassi is the basis of the film . artemisia , unfortunately could n't go as far as she could have because of the prejudice against women in the arts . it did n't help either she caused a scandal where she is accused of being raped by tassi . she had to go to rome in order to distance herself from that unhappy time of her life . valentina cervi makes a beautiful artemisia . she is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men . michel serrault plays orazio , her father . miki maojlovic is seen as tassi , the man who wanted artemisia , but ended up in jail . emmanuelle devos appears for a moment . the film has a glossy finish that the camera work of benoit delhomme captures in all its splendor . the scenic locales of the film offer an idea of what inspired that school of painting to show in their canvases . the music by krishna levy serves well what we see . agnes merlik directed with sure hand showing a visual style of her own .
intelligent , wry , and thrilling , `` the invisible man '' stood out in 2000 among sci-fi 's usual lineup , balancing out `` farscape '' 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty , cynical plots and modern noir dialogue . the show sat between `` law and order '' and `` doctor who '' on the believability meter , but there was no denying the fact that `` i-man '' 's characters went beyond caricature . even characters that verged on predictability like the keeper , the official , and eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic . paul ben-victor and vincent ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly , made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors . the effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot , and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable . the show 's low points are still entertaining , and i 've never seen such taut pilot episodes . matt greenberg and sci-fi should be commended , and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive dvd edition of the show . every time i come across a marathon of `` hercules : the legendary journeys '' on sci-fi , i roll my eyes and sigh , mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that `` invisible man '' and its ilk represented .
movie `` comedies '' nowadays are generally 100 minutes of toilet humor , foul language , and groin-kicking . modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator , the undemanding and slow of brain . sure , an occasional good comedy will come along , but they 're becoming rarer all the time . `` mr. blandings buildings his dream house '' shows what 1940s hollywood was capable of , and it 's just screamingly funny . jim and muriel blandings ( cary grant and myrna loy ) decide to build a house in the connecticut suburbs . the film follows their story , beginning with house hunting trips , the house 's riotous construction , all the way to the finished home -- with its `` zuzz-zuzz water softener '' . grant and loy are perfect for their roles , of course ( grant is particularly funny as he watches the house 's costs zoom out of control ) . however , the film is stolen by the blandings ' wise attorney , played to perfection by melvyn douglas . managing to steal every scene he 's in , douglas is understatedly hilarious while he watches the blandings lurch from crisis to crisis . reginald denny as the blandings ' harried architect and harry shannon as the crusty old water well driller are also wonderful . i 've watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh . i think it 's a good film to watch when you need a lift , whether you 're building a house or not .
three horror stories based on members of a transgressive hindu cult that return home but changed in some way . in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult . somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other . reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants . what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story . things get quite bloody . second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy . the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task . again , things slow down a bit and get weird . then there 's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising . final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands . one of the patients is a former cult member , so the successful healing gets more complicated . again , we are surprised by a twist . has a pretty gory scene in there . there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason . i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath . note : review of the german dvd .
okay , i did n't get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode . it seemed like something significant was going on that i could n't put my finger on . this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention- and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno ! but let me see what has n't been discussed yet ... a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator . yeah , 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons , especially religious , but here 's one more for ya . on a hunch i consulted wikipedia , and guess what dante divided into 7 levels ? purgatorio . excluding ante-purgatory and paradise . ( the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and ... what tony ca n't get to . ) on to the allegedly `` random '' monk-slap scene . as soon as the monks appeared , it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory . you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial ( death , disease , and sin ) came on , and he 's getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him . by the time he meets the monks he 's thinking `` hey maybe these guys can help me ? '' which sounds like contemplating other religions ( e.g . buddhism ) and wondering if some other path could take him to `` salvation '' . not that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist , but it appears finnerty tried that ( and messed up ) . that slap in the face basically tells tony there 's no quick fix- as in , no , you ca n't suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here . tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven . but at the `` conference entrance '' , he realizes that 's not going to be so easy for him . at first i saw the name vs. driver 's license problem as tony having led sort of a double life , what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people . he feels free to have an affair with quasi-melfi because `` he 's kevin finnerty '' . he figures out that he can fool some people with kf 's cards , like hotel receptionists , but it wo n't get him out of purgatory . those helicopters- the helicopters of heaven ? - are keeping track of him and everything he does . after reading all the theories on `` infinnerty '' , though , it seems like kf 's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could 've taken in his life . possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti 's that made no sense to me otherwise . aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out .
angela lansbury plays eglantine a middle aged lady in war torn england , during the wwi . she has been studying witchcraft by mail , and has been secretly learning it in her home , she is doing well , until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid , are sent to stay in angela lansbury 's huge house . she is not happy about having them , because of her secret . they only want to go back home . the oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat . the other two a boy and a girl are just inquisitive about their new place to stay and the lady that is their hostess . the kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins . fun and more of it . family fun . laughter , frolic , adventure , something for everyone . the special effects are quite good . this is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other disney films . add this to your family video library . you will not be disappointed .
wow baby , this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore , and a crazy outlandish movie . this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo , except in this case with all the blood and guts , there is a bizarre love story . it 's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie , with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites , turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs . the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human , is they need to kill each other and eat the other . hmmm , yum yum . this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that , with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun . the movie also borrows a little from carpenter 's `` the thing '' in creature design and effects . i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds , as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore . and a must-have for stoners , because you do n't even need to read the sub-titles , the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip . the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter 's movies , which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour . `` meatball machine '' is great fun for gorehounds , there is no doubt about it , and i simply loved it .
i first saw this movie on some movie channel ( hbo ? ) some time ago . i was a fan of public enemy , nwa and other early rap and had seen cb4 in theaters . anyway , the promo for it caught my eye , and i wanted to see what it was all about . well , right off the bat i knew it was going to be good ( warning ! ) and i was right . the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over ( my peanuts ) , but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great . you 've got to love the satire of rap groups ( obviously nwa ) , certain rappers ( eazy e , flava flav , ice cube ) , and the humor of the three members of nwh . who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass ? it 's too bad this movie did n't get the credit it deserved , as it was overshadowed by cb4 during their releases , but in my opinion is a much better film . if you know and like 90 's 'gangster ' rap , you 'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time . if you are n't into or do n't like 'rap ' , you 'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre .
i have to be honest and say i bought this movie , not because of the content , but because david cubitt is in it ; i know ... shallow , or what ? - but , come on , mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly . i really did n't know what to expect from watching this movie , i 'd read the other write up , and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go . david cubitt as theo , and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers , the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death . the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly , he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing - which of course he has . the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad , moving , uplifting and a celebration of life in parts . i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo . i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving , and i 'd go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo 'what makes you think you can be a father ' and theo says simply 'you . ' theo walks away then , but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort . a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts , the acting , directing , writing etc are all so well done . i ca n't really find anything else to say about this movie , except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly , to the infinite degree . the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love ( without being contrite and mawkish ) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today . well done to all concerned . not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general , and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i do n't , but this movie did , it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter .
beware spoilers . this movie was okay . goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it . okay , so the goofie foreign guy who ( spoiler here ) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny . this guy 's boss was good , too . but the movie really belonged to sarandon and hawn . these two should have had a lot more time on screen together . they 're chemistry was great . the bathroom scene-wow ! romantic , sweet , yummy . hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians . to talk about sarandon would be to give a lot away . spoilers this is a rather untypical romantic/political comedy , and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic . it touches on political issues , and just barely skims on romantic areas .
this is the best made-for-tv movie of all-time ! am i saying this because i 'm a huge silverstone fan ? partially , but even without her , i 'd still see it . i 'm a fan of serial killer genre films , and believe this to be a great entry in that category . also , mary giordano easily ranks among alicia 's top five character creations . totally memorable - like she really exists . i 'd have her on my side , too , if there was a mystery to be solved . she plays the character , like she does with her real life , with complete confidence in everything she does . seems sweet , honest , nice ... just like she is in real life . so is that acting ? yes , indeed , she 's sort of a rebel once again . this time she 's not bad , she 's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law . but she does n't do things the normal teenager would do . instead , she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes . a cliche abounds : she 's sort of avenging her father 's death , in a different way than vigilante-style . at the time , alicia seemed to be playing the same characters : rebellious , seductive , without a parent , a loner . this happens here , too , but she 's a bit nerdy this time around . that does n't matter ; she 's still cool as a nerd . check this out soon , or else giordano will be investigating why you have n't ...
all i can say is , if you do n't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie , then you 're not human ! even after watching it for the first time , i was hooked . it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe , as i 'm sure other fans will attest to . after watching it , you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us . at least we have grey gardens to remember them ! i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with . although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy , she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do . what a rare treat to have know such people ; i only wish i had !
cccc is the first good film in bollywood of 2001 . when i first saw the trailer of the film i thought it would be a nice family movie . i was right . salman khan has given is strongest performance ever . my family were n't too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him . rani and preity are wonderful . the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars . it 's about raj ( salman khan ) and priya meeting and falling in love . they get married and go to switzerland for their honeymoon . when they come back raj and priya find out that priya is pregnant . raj 's family are full of joy when they find out especially raj 's dada ( amrish puri ) . raj and his family are playing cricket one day and priya has an accident which causes priya to have a miscarriage . raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor , balraj chopra ( prem chopra ) . he tells raj and priya that she can no longer have anymore kids . raj and priya keep this quiet from the family . raj and priya decide to go for surrogacy . surrogacy to them is that they will find a girl and raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to raj and priya . raj finds a girl . her name is madhubala ( preity zinta ) . she is a dancer and a prostitute . raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees . raj changes madhubala completley . raj tells priya that he has found a girl . madhubala and priya meet and become friends . they go to switzerland to do this so no one finds out . priya spends the night in a church and raj and madhubala are all alone and they spend the night together . the doctor confirms that madhubala is pregnant and they are all happy . raj tells his family that priya is pregnant . they are happy again . madhubala comes to love raj and she wants him . what happens next ? watch cccc to find out . the one thing i did n't like about the film is their idea of surrogacy . they should have done it the proper way in the film but it did n't ruin the film . it was still excellent . the songs of the film are great . my favourites are `` chori chori chupke chupke '' , dekhne walon ne '' , `` deewana hai yeh mann '' and `` mehndi '' . the song `` mehndi '' is very colourful . in that song it shows the ghod bharai taking place and it is very colourful . the film deserves 10/10 !
i´m from germany and i love the mvovies . i go 200 times a year . tonight i saw `` pecker '' , it was a wonderful evening . thank you , mr . waters . everybody who has a chance to see the movie , go ! ! !
when reading a review from another user , saying that it 's a terrible game , i could not stand idle and do nothing ! well , this game is great , from the news clips ( with two real persons , full of humour sense and credibility ! ) , to the story , i find it very good ! i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die , until they disappear ; and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions , when riding the bike , here and there ... except that , it 's a great game , with a great story , good graphics , excellent characters , great soundtrack ... i recommend it ! surely ! it can be a bit old , but still enjoyable ! at least , on the dreamcast ... but the ps2 version shall be the same .
while the prices have gone up a lot , and some of the details have become dated , any homeowner who 's struggled with problems of homeownership should get a lot of chuckles out of this movie . i know i did . mr. blandings , a new york ad executive , decides to move his family to the connecticut suburbs and build himself a nice house there . he gets into one hilarious jam after another , from mortgages to lawsuits to construction difficulties , as the costs and schedule of the construction keep escalating out of control . i thought that the funniest scenes were where blandings hires a contractor to dig a well for water . they dig down hundreds of feet , but never find water . yet only a short distance away , a few days later , the basement of his house-to-be floods ! cary grant and myrna loy give believable performances as the harried blandings couple overwhelmed by problems they never imagined , and melvyn douglas is even better as blanding 's lawyer and family friend . the only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948 . mrs. blandings is portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb who has no idea how much additional trouble she 's causing , and there 's a black maid ( horrors ! ) . so do n't watch this movie through the social lens of 2003 , and you 'll enjoy it all the more .
neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple -- a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment . lemmon is neatnik felix ungar , bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison ( matthau ) with somewhat disastrous results . seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other 's ways , with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite . funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date . the priceless interaction between lemmon , matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches . the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters ( a pair of geese ) in disney 's the aristocats , and here -- their comic timing on top of lemmon 's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity -- where it remains much of the time . if you 're a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work , this one is not to be missed . matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast ( even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began ) and , of course , it 's easy to see why it became a top-rated tv show later on . summing up : top simon comedy , not to be missed .
i found this movie quite by accident , but am happy that i did . kenneth branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter , but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie . this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson . carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time . portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off , but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life , she made it so believable . if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women `` uglying '' themselves up for roles ( charlize theron , halle berry ) , i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar . if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did , trust me , it is worth the lost sleep .
in my opinion , a guy thing is a hilarious , witty , sexy , romantic , and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy . i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law . if you ask me , they lit up the screen like magic . you can also feel their chemistry between them . before i wrap this up , i 'd like to say that the performances were top grade , the direction was flawless , the production design was nice , the casting was perfect , and the costumes were perfectly designed . in conclusion , to anyone who 's a fan of jason lee or julia stiles , i recommend this movie . you 're in for lots of laughs and thrills , so , go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film ; i had read a lot about how spectacular it was , yet the actual futuristic sequences , the age of science , take up a very small amount of the film . the sets and are excellent when we get to them , and there are some startling images , but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards ... much the best drama of the piece is in the mid-section , and then it plays as melodrama , arising from the 'high concept ' science-fiction nature of it all , and insufficiently robust dialogue . there is far more human life in this part though , with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over-the-top as the small dictator , the `` boss '' of the everytown . i loved richardson 's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines , dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey 's aloof , confident visitor . this boss is a posturing , convincingly deluded figure , unable to realise the small-fry nature of his kingdom ... it 's not a great role , yet richardson makes a lot of it . everytown itself is presumably meant to be england , or at least an english town fairly representative of england . interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things ; the 'things to come ' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal , but to just go on and on . there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section , concerning more personal 'life ' , yet one is left quite unsatisfied . the film has n't got much interest in subtle complexities ; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle , blunt moralism , every time . and , of course , recall the hedged-bet finale : raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are ! concerning the question of the film being a prediction : i must say it 's not at all bad as such , considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right . the grander conceptions have something to them ; a war in 1940 , well that was perhaps predictable ... lasting nearly 30 years , mind ! ? a nuclear bomb - the `` super gun '' or some such contraption - in 2036 ... a technocratic socialist `` we do n't believe in independent nation states '' -type government , in britain , after 1970 ... hmmm , sadly nowhere near on that one , chaps ! ; - ) no real politics are gone into here which is a shame ; all that surfaces is a very laudable anti-war sentiment . generally , it is assumed that dictatorship - whether boneheaded-luddite-fascist , as under the boss , or all-hands-to-the-pump scientific socialism - will * be the deal * , and these implications are not broached ... while we must remember that in 1936 , there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out - or even how they were turning out - the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers ' vision on other matters . much of the earlier stuff should - and could - have been cut in my opinion ; only the briefest stuff from '1940 ' would have been necessary , yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous , and it is ages before we get to the richardson-massey parts . i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott ; who is just a trifle sceptical , cutting a flashing-eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose . the character is not explored , or frankly explained or exploited , except for one scene which i shall not spoil , and her relationship with the boss is n't explored ; but then this was the 1930s , and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then . edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles ; more so in the first as a hapless chap , praying for war , only to be bluntly put down by another massey character . massey himself helps things a lot , playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto , contrasting well with a largely diffident cast , save for richardson , and scott and chapman , slightly . i would say that `` things to come '' is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in 1936 ; one of the few serious british science fiction films to date , indeed ! its set ( piece ) design and harnessing of resources are ravenous , marvellous . yet , the script is ultimately over-earnest and , at times , all over the place . the direction is prone to a flatness , though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion . the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however ; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology , and an engaging , jerky performance that consistently beguiles . such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing ; powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this - they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers , great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate . `` things to come '' , as it stands , is an intriguing oddity , well worth perusing , yet far short of a `` metropolis '' ... 't is much as `` silly '' , in wells ' words , as that lang film , yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it .
the critics are dumb . this movie is funny and smart . i loved this movie a lot . why does everyone hate this movie so much . i wish people would love this movie more than they do n't . ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie . i do n't see you people out there making movies like them . so people should just watch it and not comment it . i like this movie . it is ok through it all . there are parts were it get 's dumb but at least they made it . jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens . but this is better than that . i ca n't believe this was rated so low .
here is a favorite tom & jerry cartoon perfect for halloween . i know it dose n't have much creepiness , but has the 'trick ' as in `` trick or treat , '' as jerry did to tom with the window blind and the vacuum-cleaner with a collared-shirt hanging on it to make it like a ghost ; but still like to put it on my list of halloween cartoons . in this short , tom was listening to the `` witching hour , '' a ghost-story program on the radio , and being frightened by the horror story being told . halfway into the story , the dramatics ( hair standing on end , heart leaping into throat , icy chills on spine ) begin happening to tom . . . literally . and jerry has been observing the whole thing and laughing to himself , thought he highen tom fears by scaring him . i love the ending , it was a little funny . and you know , this short is the first of four cartoons in which tom attacks mammy two shoes ; the others being the lonesome mouse , a mouse in the house and nit-witty kitty . and also this short is the first of twenty-five cartoons where tom speaks . the others are the lonesome mouse , the zoot cat , the million dollar cat , the bodyguard , mouse trouble , the mouse comes to dinner , quiet please ! , trap happy , solid serenade , mouse cleaning , texas tom , mucho mouse , and the cat above and the mouse below directed by chuck jones .
way back in 1955 , the british made a comedy called simon and laura , with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall . to this day , it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and , more particularly , about how television sitcoms become so popular . it was , and is , an excellent example also of self-referential cinema . so also soapdish , a film i 'd never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv . i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well , as you know . however , i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv . in fact , it 's been a while since i laughed so heartily . so , if you like satire , i 'd recommend you see it . the main actors  sally field , kevin kline , robert downey and cathy moriarty  quite simply do an excellent job , revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is . as i watched it , i kept thinking to myself : just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life ? that is , if actors ever do have a real life ? as you probably know , peter sellers , for example , was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters , so that nobody really knew the real person . so , as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie , i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch ... is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns ? and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter ( lori , played by elizabeth shue ) and , in an emotional moment , repeats the fictional lines she 'd used , on a prior episode of her daytime soap , when confronting her fictional daughter in that show ! are you confused ? well , it 's not all like that , but the dialog is stunning for originality , comedy , bitchiness , anger , depravity , duplicity , and even ... love . the story ? well , there are many stories in this film , all interwoven , and which all come together at the end ( of course  but not like a robert altman film , okay ! ) , and not all of them are resolved finally . life 's not like that anyway , right ? the pace is almost frenetic , and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes . spend the 97 minutes from your life and watch it ; you wo n't regret the time usage . the rest of the cast all perform well , although i 've never taken much to whoopi goldberg . perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and , for my money , the latter steals so many scenes from others , she gets my vote as the outstanding player . i kid you not , she gives the term bitch an entirely new face ...
when i think about this movie , all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world . texture , smell , color , that 's how i think this movie should be judged in terms of . see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace , or the sweltering turkish bath , and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice , coarse cloth , smooth skin , scented oils , flickering flames , satin rustle . do n't just watch and listen , be absorbed , let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you .
given the low budget and production limitations , this movie is very good . it is plausible , realistic , and shows how the csikos ( hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains ( puszta ) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis . we are drawn into strong feelings for the young , impressionable , yet highly courageous boy -- who admires the american pilot . if you 're looking for special effects , superman heroes , and magical endings -- this movie is not for you . if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent , amoral nazis and their lack of compassion , then you will be enthralled by this movie . i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses , dogs , and humble , helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end , this movie will be one you 'll remember for a long time .
i hand't seen the restored , or any version for that matter , of `` baby face '' with barbara stanwyck till i caught it on tcm . what a great movie ! in a nutshell lily lives in a speakeasy , she 's been pimped out by her own father since she was 14 ! then his still blows up and he 's killed leaving lily ( stanwyck ) alone cept for her black maid chico , played very nicely by theresa harris . lily leaves for the big city ( new york ) deciding to use her sex to get to the top . she does this in great style ! she seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy ! one dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law , also lily 's sugar-daddy , then commits suicide ! lily barely blinks ! stanwyck is terrific as a girl who really does n't know what love is . then in paris , she falls for courtland , played by george brent , they marry , but when he 's in deep financial straights , she bolts . nearly free with chico and a half-million , she realizes she loved court ! lily races to find him , but will she be too late ? this is pre-code hollywood at its best . stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect . this reminded me of `` original sin '' with angelina jolie , another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman , those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings , will not like baby face any better , those with belief in sex , love and power , will love it . highly recommended ! see it !
`` october sky '' is a film that will steal your heart , fill your mind with vivid imagery , and lift your spirit . the tale of homer hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first , especially when the film is set in a mining town , where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine . but homer can not follow in his father 's footsteps . with the encouragement of miss riley , ( a friendly teacher ) , members of his father 's staff , and his friends , homer attempts to make his dream a reality . yet as in any true to life story , there are many stops along the way . director joe johnston lowers us into the coal mines , where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock . with lit helmets and bent posture , they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness . the hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work . contrasting the mine shaft 's lugubrious load are the images of homer and his friend 's rocket launches . underneath the blue bowl of sky , rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere ... and nothing can match the scene when homer sees sputnik for the first time . yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters . homer 's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side as well . we see that he does love his son , despite their many arguments . the love and support of miss riley is evident as well . best of all , the film is uncomfortable . it does n't tie everything up in a nice bow . it tears at you , lifts you up . it keeps an air of reality , which is important in a film like this . this film can be considered a complete work . at first , i was disappointed that the film did not continue with homer 's life . i did n't want it to end . then i realized ... that 's what a good film does to a person . if it has done its job , you wo n't want it to end . and `` october sky '' accomplishes just that .
tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that `` tragedy is like another character '' in the film . the same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up tarantino- for sidney lumet 's best work in years , a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what 's at stake with the cast involved . kelly masterson does n't have a masterpiece of a script here ( it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end , and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount ) , but her script does convey character before plot , and in a story where the actions surround a heist it 's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat . it 's bleak as hell , unforgiving as satan , but also absolutely riveting 90 % of the time . chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during , and mostly after the botched 'mom- & -pop ' jewelry store robbery occurs , but because of the formidable cast assembled ( which , i might add , is lumet 's specialty ) . philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f * * * -ups , and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist : looting their own mother and father 's jewelry store in westchester . hawke 's hank involves another shady character though , murders occur , and suddenly it 's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father , played by a perfect albert finney . it 's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who , like in dog day afternoon , are painfully human , flawed to the bone but only wanting love & /or things to be set right , and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs . in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly ; hoffman has , until the aforementioned last ten minutes , a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation , but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally ( i.e . with finney or the car scene with tomei ) push his talents to the limit ; hawke , meanwhile , is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter , ca n't pay any debts at all , and is called a baby by his own father , and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he 's not quite as flawed as his older brother , but who wants to pick a straw for that title ? and finney , as mentioned , is spot-on all the way through , making his turn in big fish look like child 's play ( the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic , his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half ) . also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing marisa tomei , bug 's michael shannon as bad-ass white trash , and amy ryan , brian f. o'byrne and rosemary harris making brief , exact impressions , this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family 's perpetual downward spiral . if it 's not as mind-blowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumet 's done since .
so , todd sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 , shot-on-video z-epic , zombie bloodbath to be his first feature film . anyone who 's ever seen a little beauty called zombie rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is . i mean , what makes this one that much more superior ? well , then again , zombie rampage does n't include that mullet guy , now does it ? for one to comprehend exactly why zombie bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn , one must remember what the 90 's were like for lovers of bad horror . a decade that all but said goodbye to b and z-cinema as we knew it . technological advances , awkward trends , and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v . 's big-boxed golden years . and anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it 's own good , basically defeating the purpose . luckily , not everyone changes with the times . enter zombie bloodbath . and i guess this is the part where i explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years . alright , so , some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight , turning them into flesh-eating zombies , who go on a rampage , inflicting some of the most gruesome , yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90 's . the first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine . conversations that let you know that this is n't just a low-budget zombie flick , this is a z-grade disasterpiece , fella . plenty hysterical , non-existent acting to go around , and that goes triple for mr. mullet . that guy is truly the highlight of the night . the fact that todd sheets seriously considers zombie bloodbath to be that superior to zombie rampage , amuses me to no end . i mean really , both are complete jokes on celluloid , but then again , so is redneck zombies , so , obviously todd sheets is in the company of awsomeness . by 1993 , a movie this bad would no doubt , be a full-blast spoof , but mr . sheets stands his ground , giving us some good old fashion schlock , the way it was meant to be , unaware , clueless , and pointless . god bless todd sheets . for anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90 's b-horror , leif jonker 's darkness should be at the top of your list . as for zombie bloodbath , if you 're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 , then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up . 8/10
this slick and gritty film consistently delivers . it 's one of frankenheimer 's best and most underrated films and it 's easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date ( and if you are scratching your head thinking `` but i loved get shorty '' you need to be punched in the face ) . in my opinion , no one captures the `` feel '' for leonard 's characters better then john glover in 52 pick-up . the relocation of the story from detroit ( novel ) to hollywood ( film ) elevates the story 's sleaze factor to amazing heights . be a man , have a few beers and watch this movie . for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are : swag , rum punch , cat chaser , city primeval , and 52 pick-up . my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate . i also have a real special place in my cold , movie heart for dead bang and black sunday .
one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film ( and i 've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies , too ) . the actors , the beautiful settings , locations , and surroundings , the deep emotions portrayed , the sweet songs ( especially the singing voice of udit narayan , my favorite ) -- everything was just lovely . the human ( imperfect ) element was also woven in , to create some drama and drive the plot , as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution . alok nath is such a terrific actor , so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays , he almost steals the show from the young stars . i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances -- ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love -- as one of the best films out there , hindi or otherwise !
a best-selling book about honour killings in jordan is withdrawn by its publishers after allegations surface that the story has been fabricated ; associated with other allegations of its author 's past as a con-woman . a few years later , she resurfaces , conceding that she took a certain amount of dramatic licence but willing to cooperate with a film-maker to prove the substance of her allegations . what follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality , someone who 's behaviour on one had makes no sense unless what she is saying is true , yet who is seemingly incapable of saying anything that is not astonishingly dramatic but unproven at best and most often , verifiably false . it 's almost impossible to imagine what ms. khouri hoped to gain by appearing in this film : vindication ? celebrity ? - all she does achieve is to project a certain image of herself as a deeply damaged individual , and even that can not be taken at face value . director anna broinowski appears increasingly on camera as her film progresses , and increasingly exasperated to boot ; but she is finally rewarded with a remarkable , although scary and disturbing , tale to tell - and one of those films that reminds us what a thoroughly weird world it is we live in .
mating game is a charming , wonderful movie from an era gone by . hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie . my wife and i would go see it . it is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on amc . this movie has tony randall at his best . debbie reynolds is great , as always . loved it . we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of movies . too bad hollywood does not make movies like this anymore . hey hollywood .... time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe , update them a bit ( without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes ) , and hold a casting call . a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen , dvd , and on cable/sattv . sn austin , tx
page 3 * * * * out of 4 stars madhvi ( konkona sen ) enters her boyfriend 's house and its empty . she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture - 'ah ! another girl that two-timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it 's a guy this time around . and i say 'brilliant ! ' end of spoilers ( the above scene is not a spoiler really ... but for me it was so i did n't want to take a chance ) when asked upon as how was this film , my friend answered 'oh , it just an exposé of the p3 people ' which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more . when i went to the theater , i thought to myself `` i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film '' but i was proved entirely wrong and then some because i could muster only the goods . this film was great . great , not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands . konkona sen sharma is grace . she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part . one of the most charming actresses i 've ever seen . but this is not the only performance which is good in the film , there 's sandhya mridul , boman irani and atul kulkarni . particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen . ( and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normally ) the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush-hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about . and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same . but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it . even boman irani agrees to that statement  'it was a good story , madhvi ' . ( thank you ) . the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring . in the end its all a roller-coaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people . just the reason why i love watching films . ecstatic film-making . the screenplay is beautiful , clever and witty .
this is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man . it begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things , parts of high-tech equipment presumably ; it is n't really made very clear . the emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they 're herded around outside in little yellow jackets . the film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory , and talking with his crew as he does so . this is a world of relentless industrialization . it 's a relief at least to know these soulless images are n't going to be presented without a human voice , as is the case in nikolaus geyrhalter 's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry , 'our daily bread . ' 'manufactured landscapes ' contains images of people scavenging e-waste and a town ( many towns , really ) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever , with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is . some of these scenes , the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places , might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer sebastião salgado . but this photographer is n't as interested in seeing people up close . his orientation places him somewhere in between salgado and the cold , neutral modern landscape photographs of lewis baltz . all this happens in china , of course , though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in bangladesh . it is backed up by music in a new age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive . there are a good many stills of the photographer 's work -- or were some of them made by the film crew ? it is n't made clear . edward burtynsky is the name of the photographer . we see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work -- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow . the irony is that burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted , and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring . he admits himself that he takes no political stand . when we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film 's cinematographer peter mettler , burtynsky 's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification , and hence falsification . but he is showing us places that , if we look closely , reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be . logically , but not entirely fortunately , it is burtynsky whose voice-overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites . burtynsky 's `` epiphanies '' may have inspired his decades of fine work , but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we 're changing the planet irreparably ; are dependent on oil , which will run out ; that china has come into the game of massive industrialization late , and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel . the interest of 'manufactured landscapes ' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it . the reasons for watching it are two : to see glimpses of burtynsky 's work and the raw materials , the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully ; and to observe scenes from the vast , awesome , daunting , and rather horrifying industrialization of modern china . because of the limitations of the narration , the idea of the title 'manufactured landscapes ' feels insufficiently developed . it even seems a misnomer . new landscapes they are , but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than `` manufactured . '' 'landscapes of waste ' or 'wasted landscapes ' might be better titles . there is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject ; and those who want to know more about edward burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions .
this was great . when i saw the japanese version first , it was probably the scariest movie i had ever seen . it was not blood and guts , it was eerie , atmospheric and terrifying . when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version , i nearly had a heart attack ... i was concerned that the american version would be watered down , and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version . i need n't have been concerned . the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand , and gave the direction of the movie to the same man . they also set it in japan in the same location , in the same house . in fact , the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original , the only difference was the casting of american actors . that actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of `` strangers in a strange land '' to the overall horror . not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost , but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land , having difficulty integrating into society . it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and i thought it was an excellent touch . buffy actually does a very good job . she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well . there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies , or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters ' situation . in fact , it was easily as good as the ring which i also thoroughly enjoyed . i hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu . we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as `` horror '' ! ! 8/10
pialat films people in extreme emotional situations , usually with several violent scenes . in la gueule ouverte , he 's dealing with the devastating effects on a woman 's husband and son as she dies of cancer . in a nos amours , the teenage girl 's sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family . here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex-con . her motivation is a little cloudy , since loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than tv shows ; on the other hand , he 's got a fabulous body ( i wonder why depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique -- he would have been great as a rugby player ) . the casting is impressive . isabelle huppert is n't allowed to give a bland , inexpressive performance ( she has given many ) ; depardieu plays loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want -- see the scene in the bar , where he 's stabbed in the gut , runs away and seeks treatment , then soon restarts with nelly . guy marchand , with those coal-black eyes and distressed look , plays nelly 's husband beautifully ; it 's a fine repeat of the pairing in coup de foudre .
two sailors are on leave -- ladies man joseph brady ( gene kelly ) and shy innocent clarence doolittle ( frank sinatra ) . they meet beautiful susan abbott ( kathryn grayson ) and both fall in love with her . there 's more but you 've probably guessed it . the story ( even for a 1940s musical ) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and wholesome -- gets annoying pretty quick . also this movie is far too long . it 's 140 minutes and that 's way too much for such a silly story . there are also some boring numbers by jose iturbi and his orchestra . still this is worth catching . when kelly is dancing or sinatra or grayson are singing this becomes magical . none of the songs are particularly memorable but sinatra had such a beautiful voice you wo n't care . it 's shot in rich technicolor with all the gloss mgm had . the acting is ok -- kelly is fine ( although seeing him as a ladies man is pushing it ) and sinatra is just great ( although seeing him as a shy guy was pushing it too ! ) . grayson is given nothing to do but she 's incredibly beautiful to look at . some shots of her literally took my breath away ! there are plenty of highlights here : sinatra and kelly 's big dancing and singing number ; sinatra singing anything ; grayson 's two songs and the justly famous animated sequence in which kelly dances with jerry -- an animated mouse ! tom does a funny cameo too . also there 's little dean stockwell who steals every scene he 's in . so it 's too long and the plot just does n't hold up but it 's still worth catching . this was a huge hit in its day .
ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces ( i found only the egyptian one disappointing ) . stragely , all but the mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11 : the afghan refugees , deaf people , palestinians , the widows of srebrenica , aids and poverty and corruption in africa , pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath , suicide bombings in israel , paranoia-hit and state-persecuted muslim americans in the usa , old people living alone , and the aftermath of wwii in the hearts of asian soldiers . this might say something sad about the limits of empathy , in both ways : the directors might feel that americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies , while they effectively do the same with their short films . surprising myself , i found sean penn 's piece one of the very best in the collection , and * * * spoiler ahead * * * i also guess his portrayal of ernest borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a new york flat experiencing his widow life 's happiest moment when the sun shines through his window after the wtc `` collapsed out of light 's way '' , i guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general american audience would see it .
having no knowledge of this film prior to seeing it on rialto channel i found it to be a pleasant , poignant and enriching film . the casting was excellent . i loved all the characters , they were a little exaggerated in places , ( but this is a film ) . the way it looked and the enjoyably giddy ride the main character took until it turned badly , as real life can and does . yes , i thought andy macdowell was great . i was particularly interested to watch this film once it began because people so often joke about her acting abilities ( i find this quite wierd because she 's always a solid actress in my opinion ) . i loved the bit at the end where andy 's character said `` sometimes i feel he was never here '' etc. , it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that ( which i can personally identify with ) , then there was that gorgeous classical piece `` nocturne '' i think by chopin , which was a beautiful way to end ( bar the light comedy at the end , which was probably unnecessary ) . i say `` well done '' to the film makers - i have seen 1,000s of worse films !
this show was a landmark in american comedy as it was the first sitcom to star an all afro-american cast . sadly though it was never broad-casted on british tv . the evans family are a poor afro-american family living in a tower block . the dad is called james , he tries to run the house , but his wife florida always gets the better of him . the three children are the artistic jj , the moody thelma and the young intellectual child michael . always coming into the house is florida 's gossipy friend willona . i watched two episodes of this show on youtube ( black jesus and sex and the evans family- the only two on the site ) . you may be thinking why has an english viewer watched a series that has never been shown or hardly heard of in his country . the answer is this . in 1976 , britains first all black sitcom came out called `` the fosters '' only two series were made and it now seems forgotten . but i watched an episode and was really impressed . then i learnt that the scripts were identical to `` good times '' . they were exactly the same characters but with different names- sam foster was the dad , his wife was pearl foster and the three children were sonny ( a young lenny henry ) , shirley and benjamin . pearl 's gossipy friend was vilma . ( to read about the fosters , i have wrote a review about that ) . whilst watching `` good times '' only two things annoyed me . first off was the opening theme tune ( awful ) and secondly was the audience laughter . i like audience laughter , but in this somebody would say a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start clapping . apart from that it was a very funny show . let 's hope more episodes turn up on youtube and lets hope that someone will release `` the fosters '' on dvd in england . best episode : sex and the evans family- series 1 episode 6 . the foster 's episode of it was called sex in the black community . the other episode i saw , black jesus was a title of one episode of `` the fosters ''
`` the lady in question ( 1999 ) '' starring gene wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white raymond burr perry mason series . both perry and `` cash '' kept me guessing right up to the end . there were many suspects with a motive for the murder , but i had no idea which character it would be . gene wilder has a special charming wit about him , even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part . the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well . i 'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off . i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie . even his singing was a delight . i like him in this role more than his former `` sillier '' roles like `` the young frankenstein '' and `` willy wonka . '' i am hoping a & e will continue this series . they ought to call it something like `` the a & e gene wilder mysteries . '' the music fit the period . i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes . i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period . and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script . to me , that always distracts . overall , my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites : raymond burr 's perry mason .
`` once in the life '' is a very good movie . however it 's not good for everybody , due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations . the movie manages to represent in an anecdotic , believable way the `` life '' in nyc neighborhoods where drug problems are important . this depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs ( however i had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue . on video it 's ok ) . there is a little overplay sometimes , but i think it fits quite well to the general orientation fishburne gave to the movie , which gives matter for reflexion more than just being a good style exercise , notably in the time/action management . the characters , even though not simple , are easy to relate to and actors do a fine job at impersonating them . by the way i much enjoyed the soundtrack ( b. marsalis ) . if you 're not too prude , you should enjoy seeing that movie once , twice , three times . i rated the movie 9/10 .
i have not seen this movie ! at least not in its entirety . i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all . one sequence remains in my memory to this day . a ( very convincing looking ) spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon . the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him . the moon flashes into visability . . . . and for a few seconds there it is . parallel lines , squares , could it be .. then the light fades and the brief glimse of ... what ... has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth . wonderful . i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie .
i 'm normally a sucker for romantic films which are well-filmed and well-acted out . this is a romantic ( period ) film set in 17th-century italy , but filmed in french with english subtitles . the fact that it is a period film means it will inevitably be slower-paced than films set in the modern day era , so it will bore some . if you can overlook that fact , it is actually a really good film . the scenery , the costumes , and the cinematography are beautiful , and the main actors and actress are very compelling in their portrayals , projecting the intensity of the emotions that are running through the plot . the story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending . its easy to believe that this is an accurate portrayal of the real-life characters . in spite of the fact that i was really moved by the main characters and the storyline , i decided to check out the validity of the story and found out that the main theme of the movie 's story - that of an sad unfinished love story - was completely fabricated . in real life , artemisia was raped by tassi initially , rather than submitting to his advances willingly and passionately as the movie had portrayed . she continued to have sexual relations with him only because he had repeatedly promised to marry her . when they were in court , he had * not * admitted guilt of rape out of pity for artemisia 's torture ( unlike what the movie portrays ) . in reality , he had tried to portray artemisia as a loose , promiscuous woman with insatiable sexual urges . in the movie , his sister testified in court that tassi had a wife and had sexual relations with his sister-in-law , and tassi 's character was all the while made to appear as if his sister had been slandering him regarding his alleged affair with his sister-in-law ( although he admits to having had a wife back in florence ) . needless to say , in reality it was n't really like that at all . in fact , far from it . tassi was really responsible in the planned murder of his wife , whom he had begotten from rape . and to add to that , tassi really had sexual relations with his sister-in-law , impregnating her in the process , but all this was n't really mutual as well - again , he had raped his sister-in-law before . so now we have a clear picture of the real tassi as a multiple sex offender , what do we make of the film artemisia 's portrayal of him as a lover ? we take it as an attempt to make this movie into a romantic film ... that this film was never made to be historically accurate ... apart from these points just mentioned , there were other historical inaccuracies like in its interpretation of artemisia 's art ( in real-life , she was never really influenced by tassi 's painting style , and she was actually considered a much better painter than tassi ever was . ) one thing remains true and its the fact that artemisia gentileschi has been credited as the first woman painter in history , and although her mastery of the art rivalled many of her male peers , she had always experienced difficulty in getting enough credit for her work because of her gender as a woman , in 17th century italy . enjoy this film for its own sake , for it is a pretty good romantic drama , but take its historical references with a grain of salt .
i do n't know if i 'm just weird , but i thoroughly enjoyed this film . return to cabin by the lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake . in fact , i think that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one . i also thought that the cast in this movie was great , judd nelson is always the best ! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole . i liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of stanley 's screenplay cabin by the lake- it was n't a completely redundant film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them . - if you 're looking for some deep meaning , then this film is probably not the one for you . however , if you 're looking for a fun way to spend two hours , then go ahead and watch it . i 've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film . : )
ok clara bow silent film from 1927 , it 's a spin-off of rain , with bow playing the half-hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid english engineer -- clive brook . bow competes with the local widow ( arlette marchal ) for his attentions , but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up ( patricia dupont ) . the predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune . bow settles her hash fast . bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes : her opening nude bath , her hula in a grass skirt , and the dog rescue scene with bow and brook doing their own stunts . note : the imdb credit list is wrong . the film credits ( from the dvd i have ) list patricia dupont as playing mrs. haldane -- -not margaret truax as listed on imdb .
mary tyler moore and valerie harper still can turn the world on with their smiles . the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination reunion/newstart movie work . watch it and look forward to hitting sixty ! mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm . a touch of drama adds 2000 realism . a tv series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see lou grant , phyllis , sue ann , murray , and georgette !
a very early oliver stone ( associate- ) produced film , and one of the first films in the impressive career of lloyd kaufman ( co-founder and president of the world 's only real independent film studio troma , creator of the toxic avenger and , at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival , lifetime-achievement awarded filmmaker for over 30 years ) . having raised the money for this film on his own , lloyd wrote this script together with theodore gershuni in 1970 and in hindsight regrets having listened to advice to have gershuni else direct the film instead of doing it himself . but back then he was still inexperienced in the business and it is probably because of decisions like these that he takes no nonsense from anyone anymore . indeed it would have been interesting to see lloyd 's version of his own script - as one of the world 's most original , daring , experimental and non-compromising directors he probably would have given it even more edge than it already has . but as it is we have the gershuni-directed film . and weather it is due to the strong script , or the fact that he too is indeed quite a director of his own , sugar cookies is a very intelligent , highly suspenseful and well-crafted motion picture that deserves a lot more attention than it receives . the shoestring budget the small studio ( this was even before kaufman and his friend and partner for over 30 years now , michael herz , formed troma ) had to work with is so well handled that the film looks a lot more expensive , indeed does not have a `` low budget '' look at all . the story revolves around lesbian camilla stone ( played by enigmatic mary woronow ) and her lover who winds up dead through circumstances i wo n't reveal not to spoil a delightful story . this leads to a succession of plot-twists , mind games and personality reform that is loosely inspired by hitchcock 's vertigo and at least as inventive . the atmosphere is a lot grimmer , though , and some comparisons to nicholas roeg 's and donald cammell 's performance come to mind . in this mix is a very original and inventive erotic laden thriller that keeps it quite unclear as to how it is all going to end , which , along with a splendidly interwoven sub-plot with a nod to kaufman 's earlier and unfortunately unavailable big guss what 's the fuss , makes for a very exciting one-and-a-half-hour . certainly one of the best films in troma 's library , and yet again one of those films that defy the curious fantasy that their catalog is one of bad taste . the dvd includes some recent interviews kaufman conducts with woronov and the other leading lady lynn lowry ( later seen in george romero 's the crazies ) , thus giving some interesting insight in what went on during the making of this cult-favorite and a few hints of what would be different had lloyd directed it himself . highly recommended .
rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with ; this was one of them . it had good acting , dialogue , plot , and the scenery was beautiful . i laughed out loud many times , especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid . the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor , but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick . the story dealt with a group of people in their 30 's coming back to a summer camp that they had attended 20 years previously . it was a farewell week of camping , as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season . as adults the camp looked different , and they felt differently about it and each other . i recommend this funny , moving movie to all .
as the jacket proclaims , this film is `` gorgeously shot and masterfully edited , '' and , yes , it is mesmerizingly beautiful . the timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from goldsworthy 's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity . and so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in -- or in the words of matthew arnold from `` dover beach '' : listen ! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back , and fling , at their return , up the high strand , begin , and cease , and then again begin , with tremulous cadence slow , and bring the eternal note of sadness in . at one point near the end of the film goldsworthy says that `` words do their job , but what i 'm doing here says a lot more . '' as a wordsmith myself i take no offense and not for a moment do i think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates , is indeed something more than mere words can say . at another point he remarks on `` what is here to stay ... and what is n't . '' that is his theme . i think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time ; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral . the idea was , that by emphasizing how short-lived are even the mightiest works of humans , a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed . perhaps part of the effectiveness of goldsworthy 's work is in this sort of expression . he painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it , or places it in the river where it will be swept away ; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality . both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it . and it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural . thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity , but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along . this is art as art should be , akin to the spiritual . in a sense goldsworthy 's work is an inarticulated understanding . it is an experience purely of time and form . in a sense his work `` answers '' shelley 's famous poem `` ozymandias '' by saying , even as the tide washes the work away , and even as the river dissipates the expression , even so the art lives on because of our experience of it . similarly one thinks of tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out , and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished , they are given to the wind , so that we might know that all is flux . yet , in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos . goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer ( of necessity i would say ) and all his works , even the unsuccessful ones , he tells us , are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not . this cinematic production directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed . it is one of the most beautiful documentaries that i have ever seen and one of the most spiritual .
boris karloff and bela lugosi made many films together , but on the whole ( interestingly enough ) karloff usually is the better man of the two . the real exception is `` the black cat '' ( 1934 ) where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult , and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life . but more usual is `` black friday '' , where ( whatever his motive ) karloff is trying to improve brain surgery while lugosi is a murderous thug . in `` the raven '' lugosi is a sadistic surgeon , who blackmails karloff to assist his evil plans until karloff finally has had enough . rarely are they both negative characters totally . in `` the body snatcher '' , karloff does kill lugosi , but lugosi is trying to blackmail him . the one exception where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purposes to each other is this 1936 film , which i feel has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movies i have mentioned . in it karloff 's dr. janos rukh is a hard driven scientific genius who has been sneered at by the `` official scientific community '' for his theory that a rare form of radium is in nigeria on a meteorite that landed centuries ago . he has finally gotten the support of a well financed expedition led by sir francis stevens and his wife lady arabella stevens ( walter kingsford and beulah bondi ) , and has another scientist , a frenchman named dr. felix benet ( lugosi ) , rukh 's young wife diane ( frances drake ) and a friend and protégée of the stevenses named ronald drake ( frank lawton ) . before they leave , rukh is warned by his mother ( violet kemble cooper ) that he is possibly seeking wisdom that he should n't and it may end in tragedy . he tries to dismiss this , but he is worried by what she says , his scientific standing , and whether or not he is going to get his due credit . what he gets is a disaster . he finds the substance , but is infected by it 's remarkable radioactivity . he finds that he is slowly burning up , and if he tries to touch people or animals they die . he 's actually built up a friendship or understanding with benet , who figures out a type of radioactive fighting cocktail for rukh to use to counter the danger . but there are two things that are unbeatable here . the antidote can only last for a certain amount of time , and has to be replenished . and the radioactivity has affected rukh 's brain . he is increasingly jealous of diane 's friendship with ronald ( encouraged , unfortunately by sir francis and lady arabella ) , and he is equally upset that ( due to his having to pretend to have died - the effects of the radioactivity are like that ) benet and several others are collecting the kudos of the wonders that `` radium x '' is giving to man . soon rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives , ending with his own . the film certainly picked up on science to an extent . madame curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with radium . few fully understood the dangers of radioactivity in 1936 , but some idea of it was coming out . the wave of murders by rukh cause the newspapers to talk about a `` curse '' on the expedition . of course , with the idea of a `` cursed '' expedition ( on the continent of africa ) for a hidden treasure buried centuries ago , financed by a titled englishman , we have entered archeology not physics or geology ( paging howard carter and lord carnaevon ) . on the other hand , benet tries to settle the cause of the string of deaths , and reverts to an idea that was actually demolished in 1888 in england . during the whitechapel murders , sir charles warren ordered the retinas of several of the dead victims to be photographed to see if the last image on the retinas was jack the ripper . it turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes . but the idea did not die . jules verne used it in his novel `` the brothers kip '' in 1899 , and here dr. benet uses it . as this is a science fiction story , he finds the image of rukh on the the plate , but benet drops the plate accidentally and it shatters . the film is good on many grounds , the most interesting that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic towards each other . there is a type of tragic fatalism in this story that is missing from their other films . the other performances are good as well , in particular ms kemble cooper . she is best remembered as basil rathbone 's frightening sister ( jane murdstone ) in `` david copperfield '' . here her final act is the only way to bring this tragedy to an end , and who can say it did not hurt her more than her target .
the most bizarre of the cinematic sub-genres is the so called `` the great ladies of the grand guignol '' : camp horror films which combined over-the-top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies . this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday . `` what 's the matter with helen '' is the last drop of this sub-genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple . in california , debbie gets happiness , clients , tango , tap dancing and a new love interest ( dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks , menacing anonymous calls , menacing strangers , menacing agnes moorehead as a radio evangelist , cute little rabbits ( ! ) and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ( ouch ! ) . the sloppy script ( penned by henry farrell , the man who started all this genre with `` whatever happened to baby jane '' along with master director robert aldrich , joan crawford and bette davis ) is full of plot holes , red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great : the underlying themes of twisted motherhood ( with debbie and shelley 's characters as `` failed mothers '' and the overbearing mommies of the child stars ) and obsessive female bonding ( debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat texan ) are wasted . instead we get debbie reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots , although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller . but still this movie is highly entertaining . the two stars and curtis harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws . the movie recreation of the 1930 's is colorful and elegant ( look at debbie 's clothes ! ) made with a very tight budget . the increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days . and you would n't easily forget that silly `` goody , goody '' song that runs through the movie either . and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie reynolds ' chances at happiness is a hoot to watch ! 8 out of 10 .
i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona did n't have fair hair like almost always . the cast played very well , too , and i liked the script following shakespeare 's original text so faithfully . but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona . i have always thought she is very modest , and that 's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio - although it was happening only in othello 's imagination . at first , i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly . but as a whole , i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene .
this movie is a lot of fun . what makes it great especially are two things : one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes , with discussions of their costumes and superpowers . there 's an endearing earnestness to the parody that 's very appealing ; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry . claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr . furious 's desires . there 's a boatload of talent here . i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed , but this movie is a lot of fun , and kind of sweet .
i had watched snippets from this as a kid but , while i purchased blue underground 's set immediately due to its being a limited edition , only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and that 's mainly because bakshi 's american pop ( 1981 ) just turned up on late-night italian tv ( see my review of that film below ) ! anyway , i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops ( the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were , admittedly , less so ) with a rousing if derivative score . the plot , again , was n't exactly original , but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf ; the hero and heroine , however , are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed ( her bra could be torn off any second ) and half-naked to boot ( her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass ) ! still , it 's clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front ( that involving darkwolf being particularly savage ) ; the final showdown though brief , is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains ' lair inside a cave . in the long run , apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops , the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian ( 1982 ) and the beastmaster ( 1982 ) but also animated tv series such as blackstar ( 1981-82 ) and he-man and the masters of the universe ( 1983-85 ) . as for the accompanying the making of `` fire and ice '' ( tv ) ( mark bakshi , 1982 ) * * 1/2 : vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself ! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action 'performances ' ( in a studio ) of segments from the script - which would then be traced , blended in with the backgrounds and filmed . still , having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation ( on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets , for instance ) , it 's does n't make for a very compelling piece ...
the way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the x-files continues without mulder and scully , these would be a pretty good replacement duo .
e ! tv is a great channel and talk soup is so funny , in a flash you can view the episodes change . we want more funny writings by the best writer ever stan evans .. the patron saint of the mindless masses ... he is a truly talented , gifted writer , actor , comic , producer , director , and creative consultant.anna nicole loved him , but he was not a $ $ $ $ billionaire so he left him for a billionaire . many super stars wanted to make films with the actor stan evans , who has a `` humphrey bogart '' { clark gable } acting style . he should make many more movies . maybe with stephen spielberg , or perhaps many other talented producers.we wish him a moment of fame with a great fortune to gain . has he produced any mock-u-dramas ? or perhaps any docudrama ? ? ? a project about bernie madhoff would be a great tv movie written by stan evans . how many screenplays has he written ? ? is he under $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ billion contract with disney ? ? he should earn more than $ 50 million ... he could also write a tv movie about the late king of pop .. michael jackson . we want to view a lot more of and by stan evans in the movies and on tv . thank you so very much . elvis has left the building ! ! ! ! !
as is nearly always the case , when britain comes up with an entertaining and/or successful sit-com or quiz show , the yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own , grossly inferior , version . man about the house is , of course , no exception to that rule . the yanks ' version ( three 's company ) was unwatchable , braindead pap that seem to run forever . a prime example of quantity over ( non-existent ) quality . the original , on the other hand , is a fondly-remembered gem that had the savvy ( like fawlty towers ) to pull the plug at precisely the right time ( unlike the 637 episodes of 'hilarity ' that three 's company came up with ) . jo was cute , there was brilliant chemistry between the ropers , richard o'sullivan made it all look so easy , the scripts , whilst not exactly oscar wilde-standard , were consistently funny and chrissy was the most drop-dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since the dead sea was merely feeling unwell . 'nuff said .
this film is the most cult movie on metal there is . premise : a kid gets a hold of the final recording of his favorite artist sammy curr who recently dies in a hotel fire . he plays it backwards and summons him back from the dead to get revenge in the name of heavy metal on those b * * tardly jocks who torment him . any fan of true metal will enjoy this movie , and if you are a metal head being tormented by jocks , play a sammy curr album backwards ......... no wait he is fictitious , well get a hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air , your head banging , and the volume at 11 !
baseketball is indeed a really funny movie . david zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again , in a really silly , but many times smart , comedy . the 2 creators of south park , the main actors in this film , play very good , surprisingly good actually , but this is the first time i see them as actors . the movie oftenly reminded me of south park - one of my fav shows . it 's a really good and funny film , so do n't miss it . vote : 7.5 out of 10 .
xica da silva is one of the best brazilians opera soap ever ! the a black slave 's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man 's of the area love , in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by portugal , that explored its diamonds . the largest xica enemy , violante , bride that it was changed by xica , is a woman of big it influences the portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything . very religious person , she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time , she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica , that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area . the story also bill with forbidden loves , sorceries and vampires and religious fervor . xica da silva does with that you do n't want to lose a i only surrender , from beginning to end !
the story is somewhat stilted , what with the main character 's sudden reversals of fortune , but leslie howard and bette davis 's portrayals of philip carey , the naïve obsessed lover and mildred rogers , the unworthy object of his affections , raise this film considerably above standard melodrama . sensitive , cultured philip , who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years later -- ashley wilkes , the southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough reconstruction era . philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before mildred enters the picturehe does n't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he 'll never make it as a painter . it is perhaps this passivity , these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he does . although leslie howard is memorable , today `` of human bondage '' is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture , perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred , and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy . mildred may have a grating voice , but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel , making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did . although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional , she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her . one may also think she is on to something when she accuses philip of looking down on her for not being `` fine '' enough . ( the scene in which philip and norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this ) . most of the supporting characters are also effective , particularly norah the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has mildred 's beauty and norah 's decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end . the only character i found hollow was sally 's eccentric , ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era . a classic that deserves it reputation .
aardman does it again . next to pixar , aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly . i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts . i thought it translated well for american audiences . my only concern is that most of the audiences are n't going to get the subtle humor in this show . having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film , i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this . the animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal . look at the first episode with the goat , who sounds stoned , and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other `` dawg '' . is this for everyone ? not by a long shot . in fact , i 'd be happy to see the show last for a full season . but like i said before , audiences are n't going to get it .
this is one of the best movies . it is one of my favorites . a movie with good acting . the story is very sensitive and touching . good camera work also . the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list . however , they give equal or better performances than the top of the list . it is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love , romance , friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world . if you do n't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings . then go watch a sports movie . there is no killing or horror here . see the movie . it is a must . th
another powerful chick flick . this time , it revolves around diana gusman who is always getting into fights at school . instead of getting expelled , she takes her anger elsewhere , to the boxing ring . she trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight adrian and begins to fall in love with him . this movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone does n't believe in you ( in this case , her dad does n't believe in her ) . that alone makes the movie worth the price . enjoy

`` gunga din '' : one of the greatest adventure stories ever told ! a story about the british foreign legion in 19th century india and a lowly `` water-bearer '' named gunga din , a local denizen who aspires to be just like his military counterparts ; three british sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie for each other extend far beyond the bounds of mere patriotism . their 's is a true and abiding friendship for one another and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other . gunga din longs to be a soldier too , a bugler in particular , but can never attain that rank due to his subordinate social standing . however , heroes are not made according to their social credentials , they 're made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others . gunga din tries at every turn to prove his mettle , but will he ever attain the rank he so passionately seeks ? .... `` you 're a better man than i am , gunga din '' ! one of hollywood 's classics and a perfect 10 ! ! ! !
`` anchors aweigh '' is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit , and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by jule styne and others , excellent dancing by gene kelly ( and even a passable job by frank sinatra ) , and a funny well-paced script . the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson , whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo-operatic warbling from the petite miss . kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady , a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentino-charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle-american name of clarence ( sinatra ) . upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving clarence 's life , joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life . they are drafted by a policeman ( rags ragland ) , who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy ( dean stockwell ) who wants to join the navy into returning home to `` aunt susan '' ( grayson ) . at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing `` aunt susan '' but eventually kelly 's character emerges as the more likely candidate . there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly 's more famous work in films like `` singin ' in the rain '' and `` american in paris '' . the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kelly 's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry , the mouse from `` tom and jerry '' ( although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse ) . it 's a startling sequence for its time but does n't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time . i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation , where kelly was using semi-balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of `` alice in wonderland '' . eventually the characters find their way to susan 's favorite bar , a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurant/bar in tijuana . there the patrons happily allow ms. grayson to chirp her arias with abandon , and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their `` friend '' jose iturbi ( playing himself with a light humorous touch ) . of course they 've never met their `` friend '' iturbi and they spend much of the film 's length trying to reach him ( in an amusing scene sinatra 's character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career ) , sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl , where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you have n't seen anything like this outside of `` 1000 fingers of dr. t '' . iturbi himself is a kind of a god-figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine . everyone is 100 % sure that as soon as mr. iturbi so much as hears ms. grayson , her operatic career will be a reality . the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film 's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down-to-earth `` real '' mannerisms of the maestro . and speaking of iturbi 's contributions to the film , he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of `` donkey serenade '' . when all is said and done , this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss . the majority of the music was written for this film , a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like `` rain '' and `` american '' . kelly is still at his early peak , adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character . sinatra 's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing . stockwell is a charming addition to the clan , and grayson 's character is endearing when she is n't posturing on stage . iturbi adds that well-grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic-era mgm musical . this is one of the better ones .
the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point . it 's obvious he has n't been young or innocent in a very long time , or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well-meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace . if only it was that easy . but the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better , as the situation gets worse and worse every single day . well , if you 're not part of the solution , you 're part of the problem . the central theme is that revenge begets more revenge , which begets even more , in an ever-expanding bloodbath . both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side , which they think justify their committing even more in retaliation . where does it end ? and apparently he missed the significance of `` the bubble '' referred to in the name , which was that people living in tel aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them , which is partly why they seemed so naive . ( he also seemed to think that ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem , which tells me he was n't paying attention when ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered . ) i found it very brave of the director , the screenplay writer , and both star-crossed lovers , to update the romeo & juliet story to a modern troubled land , and to make both lovers male . let 's be honest here : very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female ( young love wins all hearts ) -- but when people 's uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that , incredibly , these same people would rather have them hate each other , then the conclusion is inevitable .
i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival , in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival . i absolutely was into it . i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes . it is amazing set-design . the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies . and the music is so nice . i rate this experience 9/10 . * spoilers ahead * the documentary tells about awesome blues-men , with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing . it is really amazing . but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary . it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those blues songs in a modern way . i did n't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs . this is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club . the documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema , that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open-air cinema . though the sand , the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night .
the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie , we were watching it for alex winter of `` bill & ted 's '' fame . we did n't know what to expect other than who and what it was about . by the time the movie was over , we knew that it was love at first sight . this movie , while not completely historically accurate , was and is the best one of its genre . i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion , none of the others can compare . it fibbed a little at certain details , but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story . i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good , but none as captivating as this one . `` haunted summer '' has the qualities of a painting . the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas , framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric 's home . the costumes were gorgeous and , despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world , made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself . the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva ( where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie ) and the serenity that these historical figures found there . this movie shows , besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england 's harsh judgements , the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well . yes , there were drugs . it was a fairly common practice during that time , a time when drugs were not illegal . and the taking of laudanum ( the liquid form of opium ) was medicinal as well as recreational . shelley suffered from consumption . lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot . it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer . and they were poets during a time when experience was the key . there was no time for prudish caution . passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era . and out of the thoughts and discussions of science , religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend : `` frankenstein . '' yes , in this movie , we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin ( not married to shelley at that time ) played by beautiful and talented alice krige . she is the control factor to all that goes on until she , too , gives in to experience . but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms . as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father . the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played . the music fitting . the direction captured the essence of the summer , as i 've read about it . this movie was based on a wonderful book `` haunted summer '' by anne edwards . if you like this movie , read the book . the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story . if you are a person who loves history ( even the little inaccuracies from time to time ) and romance and the gothic , then this is a movie for you . it shows the birth of the birth of the monster , which even today teaches us about the morals of `` playing god . '' a definite must see movie !
i loved this film , at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but i quickly got into it . there must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and i really admire the work done in cutting it down . if you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here , ( and some real tossers ) . technically i liked it a lot too , they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but i was n't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers . ( open water drove me nuts , mostly because there are cheap , progressive cameras available now and i see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema ) . sorry that 's my own little rant . i definitely recommend this film if you 've ever been involved with the music scene , it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious , i might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it 's a classic piece .
gojoe takes a little getting used to at first , but the final result is very satisfying . the tale , about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate , but dangerous samurai , is worth more than a watch . there is a lot at stake here , from physical survival to soulful salvation . the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired samurai film at first , but it does eventually delve into more mature/adult territory soon after . not to be missed . gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around post-kurosawa . 8 out of 10 ( go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films )
an interesting thriller that has paul winfield as a detective on the case of a murder . paul winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease , it was hard to tell the man was even acting . maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice/narrator of `` city confidential '' , winfield ends his career with a so-so movie ; but as always , winfield shines . a treat to watch . erika eliniak is well , erika eliniak , nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department . though , to be fair , this is one of her better efforts . bottom line : a watchable thriller that should n't be missed by any paul winfield fan . a decent telefilm to help send paul winfield off to celluloid heaven . what an actor . he will be missed .
the lady from shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director , orson welles , whose last hollywood film this was for many a moon . it 's a kind of post-modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular , and it concerns a happy go lucky irish sailor ( played by welles ) who falls in with a mysterious lady ( rita hayworth , who was married to welles at the time ) , and her crippled , and probably impotent husband , played with a brainy , malevolent gusto by everett sloan . a long sea voyage follows , with welles in tow as bodyguard , and the plot thickens when sloan 's law partner ( glenn anders ) turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown . a murder plot ensues , and all sorts of calamities follow for welles and his employers , and at this point the story , fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far , goes off the deep end , and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set-pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not , by itself , possess , and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess . it 's hard to know what welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife . but self-destruction intervenes , as it often does with welles , and miss hayworth has never looked less fetching . that she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar , as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness , a quality she does not possess in this picture . the director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at o'hara , the ( presumably ) easygoing sailor , since welles , for all his many gifts , was not known as an easy man to work with . this is a role that twenty or thirty years later sean connery or robert shaw might have been able to breath life into . welles does not . the most interesting performance in the movie is glenn anders ' as grisby , sloan 's loony , treacherous law partner . anders works wonders with the part , and is photographed to look bizarre , while his scenes end on odd , sour notes , and are often choppily edited ; but for all this he manages to make grisby 's derangement palpable and disturbing , and anticipates , in a genteel way , the more flamboyant method actors of the fifties , such as timothy carey . there is a question that nags me about this film : what was welles trying to say ? he was a highly talented and intelligent man , and tended to make statements in his movies , which , whether one agrees with his world view or not , were brilliantly put forth . i think i have an answer , or a partial one : welles was summing up his movie career . he had reached the end of his rope in the hollywood studio system he despised , and he knew it . the lady from shanghai is n't exactly a nose-thumbing at the studio moguls of the day , but i suspect that it is , in its portrait of amoral , rival big shot lawyers ( read : producers ) expressing welles ' opinion of the power brokers of hollywood . that he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling . welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler , and he rarely lived in one place for long . he was hired by a studio to provide it with a big , prestigious film ( citizen kane ) , which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered . this may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film , which is to say welles ' personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony , and his inability to deliver the goods , as promised . the mere fact of him turning up in hollywood , like his mere presence in the film , could not forestall disasters well beyond his control . that he presented himself in the movie as an amiable , naive outsider shows a lack of self-knowledge on welles ' part . he was much more of an inside player than he let on , and i imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life , and himself for knowing so much .
`` mr. harvey lights a candle '' is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spall . while we can predict that his titular morose , up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past , how his emotions are unveiled is surprising . spall 's range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertory . while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes , such as on `` the simpsons , '' this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brook 's script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes , and is almost formally divided into acts . we 're introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids ( with their uniforms i could n't tell if this is a `` private '' or `` public '' school ) , as they gather  the rapping black kids , the serious south asians and muslims , the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually . the young actors , some of whom i recognized from british tv such as `` shameless , '' were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures . celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor 's role than the martinets she usually has to play . a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious . we think , like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of `` coupling , '' that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance , but it 's much more about faith in people as well as god , which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the u.s. over christmas . nathalie press , who was also so good in `` summer of love , '' has a key role in mr. harvey 's redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching , but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way ( unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials ) . while it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip `` a pilgrimage , '' this quiet film was the best evocation of `` good will towards men '' than i 've seen in most holiday-themed tv movies .
when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white b films that were parodied on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show . yet , while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films , the 1950s did have some very good , if not great , science fiction films like the day the earth stood still , the incredible shrinking man , invasion of the body snatchers , war of the worlds , and the thing from another world . yet , the best of the bunch , for its literacy and production values , was undoubtedly mgm 's first big foray into a level science fiction , forbidden planet , released in 1956 . it was a 98 minute color film , directed by fred m. wilcox , that featured then state of the art special effects , and was endowed with a very good screenplay by cyril hume , from a screen treatment called fatal planet , by irving block and allen adler , who adapted aspects of william shakespeare 's the tempest into it . the film drew raves when it was released , for its oscar nominated special effects , its all electronic music score , by louis and bebe barron ( although credited as electronic tonalities , to avoid music guild fees ) , vivid matte paintings- inspired by chesley bonestell , and the famed monster of the id ( moti ) , which was animated by an animator , joshua meador , on loan from the walt disney studio . even more famous was the appearance of robby the robot , in his first role in either film or television . later he would appear in the film the invisible boy- included in this dvd as a bonus , as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone , night gallery , and lost in space- with whose own robot he is often confused , and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film gremlins . the tale is simple , but elegantly constructed , and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced 'love story ' aspect in the film . in the 23rd century , the united planets cruiser c-57d- a flying saucer , led by commander j.j. adams ( leslie nielsen- yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days ) , is en route to the planet altair iv , to investigate what happened to the crew of the bellerophon , sent to the planet twenty years earlier . after a year 's journey , there they encounter the lone survivor of the party , doctor edward morbius ( walter pidgeon ) , the prospero stand-in- a philologist , his gorgeous blond daughter altaira ( anne francis ) - the miranda character in a pre 1960s miniskirt , and robby the robot , the domestic servant who is the calibanian counterpart . morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the bellerophon party in their first year , yet he was immune to it . all in all , it 's a technically good film- especially with some rear projections and matte paintings , and the absurdity of the adult reactions to timmy 's and robby 's exploits borders an dalian surreal absurdity . yet , it 's manifest that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film conjures , for it 's played straight , thus making it even funnier . as for the main feature ? forbidden planet deserves all its kudos . it 's not a perfect film , but it 's a great way to spend a couple of hours , and far better than star wars , which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated , and juvenile . only such films like 2001 : a space odyssey , solaris , alien and aliens , and the first two terminator films , have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects . it 's worth knowing that , despite forbidden planet 's 'happy ending ' , there is the possibility that the moti is still dormant within alta , as well . after all , she is her father 's daughter , and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the moti attacked the ship a second time . also , the film wisely only 'shows ' the moti once , and never shows the krel , for the imagination can always conjure greater scares than the best special effects . the film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale , something that far more realistic art films often fail to do . forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era- unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war allegories . watch it , and you will agree , as well as sleep a little less easy . but , even if you do n't , there 's still the scene of anne francis skinnydipping . that alone is timeless .
a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise . placed at the beginning of talkies , prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full-on silent film -- which is still is at heart -- and flirting with sound and sound effects . the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just does n't help it at all . hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach , for example , is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks ' dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance . other than that , the movie rolls along more or less well , with little jumps in continuity here and there -- something quite common in films from this era -- and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents . in a way , this is an experiment of a movie , and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near-intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level . louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for : she 's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend . her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time ; the last of the flapper/jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now , with the onset of female independence , women as professionals were being represented in film . that brooks 's character decides to leave her boyfriend ( even if she does `` reconcile '' with him later ) is also a little ahead of her time . however , her character 's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what is n't there -- that her boyfriend wants her to succeed -- and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre . this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense ( seen in the man who knew too much ) and cuts from brooks , her image on screen , and the murderous boyfriend . even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing `` live '' brooks with the now dead one -- a chilling effect to a chilling , powerful movie .
`` still crazy '' is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all-time . it has been erroneously compared to `` this is spinal tap '' , which it has no relation to . `` spinal tap '' is a satire ( and , quite frankly , not a very good one , in spite of it 's `` outing '' of many rock clichés ) . unlike `` tap '' , `` still crazy '' is populated by great actors , great songs and great human situations . you care about the people in `` still crazy '' . that 's all that matters . oh , yeah , the music 's pretty damn good , too , written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze . american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea ( the crying game ) , but would only later become familiar with bill nighy ( underworld , love actually , pirates of the caribbean ii ) and timothy spall ( the harry potter movies ) .
excellent , pre-code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired ( by writings of nietzsche ! ) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself , use men to her advantage . not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power . stanwyck , even in this young version does n't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here , ever driving herself and the film forward . not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo . great fun , if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female . still , that 's life !
this movie is great ! this movie is beautiful ! finally , a movie that portrays moslems as people , no stereotypes here . this movie is driven by the story , by the acting and above all by its theme , that of cultural affirmation and discovery . they may seem like clichés but they are not , at least not in this movie . the vista of the grand mosque of mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the west . here the people are caring , supportive , devout , tolerant and devoted to each other . what a welcomed and way overdue departure from the usual negative portrayals of arabs . outstanding movie .
flynn , known mostly for his swashbuckling roles ( and his bedroom antics ! ) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully . playing real-life boxing champ jim corbett , flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist , all the while setting one eye on society deb smith . he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men ( and a dog ! ) including a prominent judge . the next day , he gets a chance , via smith , to gain entrance to the judge 's private club . he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club 's resident boxer . his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers , up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan ( bond . ) flynn is downright magical here . he is the epitome of charm , charisma and appeal in this role . he looks terrific ( especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit ) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork ( impressively ! ) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally . smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn . at this stage , he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation ( he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time ) and she does so admirably . she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude , yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell . bond is incredibly burly , brawny and towering , yet tender when the script calls for it . amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson . frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn 's manager . the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn 's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types . the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed . a few of the sets are amazingly presented . some of smith 's gowns border on the garish , but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well . it 's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing , but it 's also so much more . some of it ( like the character traits shown by flynn ) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes , but a lot of it is authentic ( like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes . ) one line is particularly memorable : `` i believe you like me more than i like you , but it 's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me . '' it 's classic romantic dialogue ( and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well . )
this is a great movie for all generation x'ers . what a different world the america of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st century . you can get a sense of what an 1972 america gone by was like by watching this movie . i found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now . just think ... back then there were only 4 or 5 tv stations to choose from . there was no aids , muslim terrorists , road rage , 911 , bird flu , freeway snipers , etc , etc . the vietnam war was just over . there will still be 7 years before star wars comes out . the personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away . when this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it . so it began touring small protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors ( this was the days before vcrs of course ) . the pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing a thief in the night to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film . then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room . members of the congregation would invite `` unsaved '' friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week . if you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value , then i think you will enjoy the film more . of course i am speaking as a gen xer . if i had a time machine i would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now .
i 'm sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it ; after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii . with the cast , the location , style of the directing and its publicity  shows women walking around on the beach and all that . no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it . it was wrong of them to do that . cause after i decide to watch the show , there are actually more thing going on , real juicy story and conflict , turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much  addictive . the story of the hotel clerks , the manager , the owner and their complicated love life . also enter the troublesome hotel 's visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel . it actually more exciting than it sounds here . i wo n't deny that the acting suck but it ai n't that bad that you 'll look away . the story is not so consistence but good enough . the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time . i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience . recommendation : i really do enjoy watching this . zillion times better than expected . rating : 7.5/10 ( grade : b ) please rate my review after reading it , thanks .
moonwalker by michael jackson is a real adventure film for the whole family ! before the real story of the movie starts , we get a performance of the bad tour ( man in the mirror ) , and it kicks off a great movie . after that we get a kind of a collage of michael carrier , as it was until moonwalker came out in 1988 . after a few music videos also ( speed demon , leave me alone , etc . ) the story starts . the plot is basically that michael and his 3 friends ( who are kids ) are being chased by the bad guy of the story `` mr. big '' , because they discovered his evil plans of getting children all over the world hocked on drugs . during the chase we see fantastic segments , fx . michaels video for smooth criminal , which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences , etc . but then one of the kids get kidnapped by mr. big , and michael will haft to save her before she gets a drug addict . during the movie we see special effects not only amazing for those days standards , but also impressive today . for instance , see michael turning in to a robot/spaceship in order to protect his friends ! it 's so cool ! the movie ends with a performance of come together ( later published in michaels double-album of history ) , and you leave the movie with a magic feeling . amazing ! i recommend this for every family who wants to spend a nice night together with candy and popcorn in front of the tv . and now some parents might stand up and say : `` but michael jackson is an alleged child abuser ! '' yeah , he is indeed , but , come on , we all know it is n't true ! wait and see ..
small spoilers alert ! ! ! good movie ... very good movie . and i 'm surprised to say that myself , because i 'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director 's name deran serafian usually means bad news . most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen . this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action . this movie really fascinated me . good accomplishment , seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved . it really is the story that keeps you focused . especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied . sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth . it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle . of course , that 's where the reality and the `` based on a true story '' stops . the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker . in this movie , the count ( vlad teppish ) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman . and they 're all pretty girls , i 'll give him that . overall , good acting by unknown faces , enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline . this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore . but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr . heck , it 's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title . these two films have nothing else in common , but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture . check it out ... my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10

i just realised i 've been using imdb for years now and i 've never reviewed my favourite film . by favourite i do n't mean something i like for now , i mean this film is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience going to touch it . this is obvious because i am never going to be a child again ; i saw this film on itv in the early nineties . i was 12 which is the age group this film is directed at , i 'm also male , the gender that this film is intended for ( the overwhelming majority of miyazaki 's protagonists are female ) . consequently this film indelibly inspired my childhood psychology and i am forever indebted to carl macek ( sp ? ) for producing the english dub of this film which is far superior to the di $ ney production which is not even funny - i 've never even been able to watch that one - of course subtitled is the only way ultimately however the macek version is so good ( the voices almost exactly corresponding to the original japanese actors ) that this version is available on the japanese dvd ! it 's not available on any distribution in an english-speaking country . go figure . there are hundreds of competent reviews so i 'm going to put some trivia here , not that i 'm the definitive archive of information for this film . first up i 'd like to agree with the reviewer who stated that you need 20 out of 10 to review miyazaki 's films - they are so in their own league that they make almost the whole catalogue on imdb combined pale into insignificance . the fascinating story with this film is that miyazaki based the countryside around slag 's ravine ( pazu 's town area ) on the welsh mining communities . he visited wales for a few months in the early 80s ( might be late 70s ) just after one of the great mining strikes . being an avid supporter of the student socialist movements in the sixties he felt their plight . the fight between the townsfolk and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man . the countryside and the clouds especially in this film remind me of where i grew up as his film depicts a fantasised version of the rolling hills of the midwest british isles . the island is of course from swift 's genius satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in swift 's book is , deliberately , ridiculous . in castle in the sky , miyazaki weaves together myths such as atlantis and the tower of babel - i think the architecture in addition is based on peruvian ruins though i 'm not sure , someone told me that . anyone who gets round to reading this review and who likes this film really will want to check out miyazaki 's epic series mirai shounen conan - future boy conan - based on the short sci fi novel 'the incredible tide ' by alexander key ( novel is available online ) . conan is basically a prototype for laputa 's pazu and shita . in addition you may not be familiar with his earlier work for masterpiece theatre - some of his key frame animation . he also did key frame for sherlock hound - this has some of the finest backgrounds i 've ever seen too . also check out miyazaki and takahata 's first feature film horus prince of the sun ( 1968 ) - amazing by today 's standards in fact . what else ... gauche the cellist and the flying ghost ship - though they 're pretty rare . this film is such a gift , i do n't know what we 'd do without it with all this other crap storytelling around , this is like an oasis . arigatou miyazaki-sensei !
like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie ( on tv , never on the big screen ) , when i was a teenager . my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then , and i must say he was not only right , but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time . i have seen it two or three more times since then ( just a few days ago i gave it another watch ) and it has not lost anything of its impact with time . it still a great and well worth to be seen movie ! manr regard peckinpah 's ride the high country as one of the first and best later western , which had a realistic look at life in the old west , but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier . actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time , or maybe it still is ... although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100s of western ( i like this genre ) i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one . two men bound together , partly by hate , partly by not seeming to have other choices , surrounded by beautiful ms. padget , a crippled old man and a young inian , leading the life of buffalo-killers until fate reaches out for one of them . nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem . when the camera moves on and away from mr. taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight ( on a tree ) and echos from the past , when all the hatred began , are present again . mr. taylor has got his buffalo , but in the end the buffalo got him . aside from the top performances of everybody involved , the intelligent script and the great dialogue , it should also be mentioned , that the last hunt is superbly photograped , i have seldomely seen a western that well shot ( aside from the ones directed by anthony mann , which are also all superbly photographed ) , that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well . and director brooks is really a superb storyteller . master craftsmanship ! he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre , but even in an as prolific career as this one , the last hunt still shines as one of his best , if not his best . definitely would deserve a higher rating , compared to the 7-something ride the high country enjoys .
first of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book , especially when you 're dealing with master writer like tolkien . this adaptation wonderfully synthesizes tolkien 's universe with 1970s psychedelia , aesthetics , and liberal culture . yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little `` rough '' in its technical execution but it 's beautiful none the less , and very evocative in terms of giving a unique `` sense of place '' to each of the scenes . beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that 's far superior to the acting in the new live action movies . and while the cell animation might not be the most `` technically proficient '' animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced . the background paintings vary from traditional `` fantasy '' motif to outright abstraction , but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film . if you 're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then i can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting , transcendental imagery , and jrr tolkien then this film is a must see .
i think it was ebert who gave stella four out of four stars but , other than his , i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions , love , and sacrifice ( three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common ) . here the major theme is class division . stella is a story from depression era america . that said , it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake ( if you ask a stanwyck fan or two ) was not exactly appreciated . fans of the original never gave it a chance . furthermore , this version of stella was made in the 1990s , not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america ( as the depression was ) . now is the time to remove the rosy-coloured glasses , in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in america , and see that this powerful story still rings true , is as timely and relevant as ever , in its updated format . yes , class divide is the major theme here . stella is among the working poor , single , with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams . she works in a bar , does n't have much money , lives in a crummy apartment . you get the drift . in the morning , she does n't really want to get out of bed . on her wall , pictures of movie stars she idolizes . a man sees her dance at the bar . he 's wealthy , educated , from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with stella 's . his major concern is what ivy league college to attend , her 's is how to pay the rent , how to be 'happy . ' they have an affair . they like each other . stella ends up pregnant . stella tells the guy the news . his response ? `` how about an abortion ? '' she replies , `` i just wanted a room full of balloons . '' he supplies the balloons , and the proposal , but she sees his heart is not in it , and has too much pride to accept . she sends him packing . her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles -- the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father . stella , alone and unloved , and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday , makes the ultimate sacrifice . she gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter , and perhaps live vicariously , and with hope , knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for . now , for the movie . everything is right about it . beautiful score , artful cinematography , great set design ( contrast between the two lifestyles ; the messy apt . and the decorated mansions ) , wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast , with bette midler , in particular , oscar-worthy . this is a film which is much more significant and well-made than you 've been led to believe .
i have not seen each and every one of chan´s movies , but this is for sure the best one i have seen so far . the story in it self is nothing special really , so i won´t go deeper into that . what makes it special is the stunts , the fighting , the good acting , the warm sense of humor . the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it . all the cool stunts ( of course made by jackie himself ) makes you want jump around in the couch and scream . it´s just awesome ! even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it . i know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of , at least it is here in sweden . but i can assure you , it´s worth a try .
pecker is a hilariously funny yet twisted film about a small town in baltimore whose daily , humdrum routine is broken by pecker , a young photographer who takes pictures of `` real things . '' no pretty models , no gorgeous men , just hard living . this wonderful film pokes fun at the plasticness of the urban art chain . there is one particular scene when a homeless woman who shops at pecker 's mom 's thrift shop buys the same exact coat as one of the whitney art junkies for only 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars . this just goes to show you that no matter what kind of money you have , you might not always have taste . yet again john waters sends you into a never-ending spiral of laughter and raw reality . you can have your mainstream hollywood movies with special affects and mountains of celebrities , but give me a `` pecker '' or a `` hairspray '' ( another excellent john waters film ) over a `` titanic '' or a `` godzilla '' anyday ! !
yes , this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun ! that 's because although the film clearly was horror , some of the stories had a light spirit -- and there were even occasionally a few laughs . this is n't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious . because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good , it 's one of the better movies of this style i have seen . the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself . four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants . the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer 's block . so , for a change of scenery , they rent this house . almost immediately elliott 's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer . amazingly , soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character ! again and again , the psychotic killer appears and then disappears -- making it seem as if he is losing his mind . this might just be the best of the stories , as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive . the second , while not bad at all , is probably the weakest . peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago ( though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary ) . when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town , he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this . later , a friend ( joss ackland ) visits and he , too , sees the figure and is entranced by it . this all leads to an ending that , frankly , was a bit of a letdown . christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl . during most of this segment , lee seemed like an idiot , but in the end you can understand his demeanor . though slow , this one ended very well . the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre . jon pertwee ( the third `` doctor '' from the dr. who television series ) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula . however , nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique , he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film . it 's actually pretty interesting that he played this role , as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times ( give or take a few ) . i enjoyed pertwee 's line when he basically said that lee 's and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi 's ! perhaps this is why lee did n't take this part ! despite some very silly moments , it was very entertaining and fun -- possibly as good or better than the first segment . considering that the film started and ended so well , had excellent acting and writing , it 's hard not to like this film .
yeah , it is . in fact , it 's somewhere in my top 20 all time favorite movies . number 15 , i think . anyways , i 'm usually not one for plots , but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games , ( final fantasy 7 , for example ) and not movies . but this one has it all . vivid drawings of planets , stars , an extremely well written screenplay . while this is not really for children , they can still watch it , it contains no graphic blood , guts and silicone . but i do n't think they 're going to understand it .
the first film was a nice one , but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which i found more poignant and endearing . this sequel is inferior , but not bad at all . sure the slapstick is too much , the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired . but the dogs are very cute here , and eric idle is hilarious as the macaw . the film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes ( especially cruella 's ) , and the music is pleasant . the acting is mostly very good , ioan gruffudd is appealing and gerard depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as cruella 's accomplice . but the best asset , as it was with the first film , is the amazing glenn close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as cruella , even more evil than she was previously . overall , nice . 7/10 bethany cox
uncompromising look at a suburb in 21st century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker u.seidl is a provocative , minimalistic and intense piece of observation cinema . after the world-wide spread of big brother reality shows , hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling , profound level . hard to like but unignorable piece of european art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy , yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy manner . a must for lovers of world cinema .
this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man , and how he must deal with everyone . his mother is depressed , his younger sister is a pain , his older sister is somewhat accepting . the relationship looks good with his boyfriend/exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy . unfortunately , the new guy screws around on him and says it really did n't mean anything . our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves , dumping his new lover and starting over . we are left with him starting over and viewing , not participating , in happiness . so maybe things will go better for him in the future . the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating .
first off , i had n't seen `` the blob '' since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience . pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today . and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s `` fear of teenagers '' . but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be . sure , it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world . but `` the blob '' packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults do n't believe them . in fact , there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world . and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him . to sum up , if you can take off your postmodern irony filter , there 's a lot more to love here than meets the eye .
i have never seen a show as good as full house . full house puts all of the newer shows to shame , big time ! anyone who has never seen it , which i do n't see how it is possible , should see it . it is a great show for anyone of any age . full house will make you laugh , it will make you cry , it will amaze you . true , some people feel that there are some `` cheesy '' aspects to the show , but , the positive aspects out weigh all of the `` cheesy '' aspects . full house ran it 's first episode on september 22 , 1987 entitled `` our very first show '' and ran it 's last episode on may 23 , 1995 entitled `` michelle rides again part ii '' . the plot of the show is very believable . danny tanner ( bob saget ) losses his wife , pam , in an accident involving a drunk driver . danny has his brother in law , jesse katsopolis ( john stamos ) , which is pam 's younger brother , and danny also brings in his best friend joey gladstone ( dave coulier ) to help him raise his three daughters . danny 's daughters are named dj ( candice cameron-bure ) , stephanie ( jodie sweetin ) , and michelle ( mary-kate and ashley olsen ) .joey and jesse plan on moving in with danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years ; which is the number of years the show ran for . the following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor/actress who played him/her : john stamos ( jesse ) : john stamos is a great actor . he plays jesse . jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break . in full house , john stamos does a great job portraying his character . he looked and played music like his idol , elvis presley . bob saget ( danny ) : bob saget is also a great actor . he looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver . he has to raise three girls without a having the girl 's mother . bob saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls . dave coulier ( joey ) : one word can describe dave coulier , funny . he is great . playing the character of joey was perfect for him . he does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break . candice cameron-bure ( dj ) : she is a tremendous actress . she plays the oldest sister , dj which is short for donna jo . she is one of the best actresses i have ever seen . her acting ability in full house was very believable . jodie sweetin ( stephanie ) : two simple words can describe jodie sweetin , incredibly amazing ! i wish i could say every thing that i would like to say about jodie , but , i would use up the 1,000 word maximum just on her . she got her start in a kids show called mother goose stories and when she came to full house , she blew the audience 's and creator 's mind . her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was . according to dave coulier , jodie was supposed to be the star of the show . it was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break . jodie , at five years old when the show first aired , could hit every line perfectly . she showed great enthusiasm . most young kids ca n't do this . as you can probably guess , jodie sweetin ( stephanie ) is my favorite character in full house . mary-kate and ashley olsen ( michelle ) : great actress . full house is where they got their start . they received the part of michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera . there are many more cast members that should be recognized . these are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987 . the only negative thing that i can say is how full house became the michelle show towards the end . i think it was to focused on her towards the end . especially when i think jodie and candice were much better at acting . full house is a great show for everyone . it can teach you a lot . one of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy , such as loosing a family member , occurs . full house continues to attract new fans . with all this said , there is only a couple things left to say ; full house will never die , and , thank you , the cast of full house , for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy .
yeti deserves the 8 star rating because it is the one of the greatest bad movies ever made . i saw it at a midnight screening in l.a. and people were roaring and cheering at the insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic trainwrecks where you think it cant get any stranger and then it does ! the millionaire who funds the project to thaw the yeti looks like chris penn and john goodman both poured into an ill-fitting suit - the guy playing the scientist is one of the worst actors to ever appear on screen - and yes , there is a mute boy ( who sorta kinda looks like a girl ) and he 's mute ever since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents ( hmmm- maybe therapy for the kid ? ? ) . then this hottie italian girl is seen by yeti ( once he thaws - which takes forever ) -- and he is instantly in love with her - what is one of the most hysterical things about the movie is that this giant yeti makes `` bedroom eyes '' at her - it 's like a large barry white trying to seduce a groupie . in fact , once the large yeti picks up the hottie and has her against his chest - she accidentally touches the yeti 's nipple and yes , the film takes the time to show his large grey nipple get hard ! ! ! ! yikes of all yikes ! plus there 's a collie dog in it because the italian producer must have heard that american audiences like dogs and he sorta kinda tried to get a lassie - there 's also this insane scene where the yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the large fishbone and uses it to comb the italian girl 's hair `` gee , thanks yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like dead trout . you 're the best . '' this film is more bizarre than something ed wood could have ever dreamt up . if you are a fan of classic cinema crap - seek this baby out .
after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller , madam lili ( 1969 ) starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon , i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller . all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis . it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor . once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back . it is , for its time , a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918.it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews ! as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks . if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity .
disney might just be on to something here . first , they had `` remember the titans '' with denzel , a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america . now , with quaid and the rookie ... yet another sports story based on truth . both movies move you to tears at times , and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them . my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie . we were not let down , when asked if we 'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out , it was a no-brainer . most definately .
i enjoyed the night listener very much . it 's one of the better movies of the summer . robin williams gives one of his best performances . in fact , the entire cast was very good . all played just the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little . sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch . toni collette is great as the mom , and never goes over the top . everyone is very believable . it 's a short movie , just under an hour and a half . i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version . i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie . the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion , which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well . do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads . it is not a hitchcockian thriller . see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well . if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed . my only complaint with the movie was the ending . the director could have left a little more to the audience 's imagination , but this is a minor quibble .
well , after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo 's the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film . the plot was simple , beautiful model alison parker ( cristina raines ) moves into an apartment building that 's a gateway to hell . the sentinel is a down right creepy film , even if it 's a bit slow . it 's a mix of the omen and rosemary 's baby . the acting is fine , and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals . it 's a very odd , campy but in the end , i truly believe a great film ! one of my favorites from the 70 's , even if it 's nothing greatly original . it 's wacky and extremely creepy ! probably one of my all time favorites . 9/10
i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50 's and 60 's rather than as a story . because there is no real story here . just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that do n't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture . the first time i saw chocolat i did n't really `` get it '' until having thought about it for a few days . then i realized there were lots of things to `` get '' , including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner , just no plot . anyway , it 's one of my all-time favorite movies . the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry . if you like `` exciting '' movies , do n't watch this -- you 'll be bored to tears . but , for some of you ... , you can thank me later for recommending it to you .
jim carrey is good as usual , and even though there are quite a few `` jim carrey moments '' , it 's definitely not a `` jim carrey movie '' . it 's targeted mostly at children , and i managed to enjoy it as such movie . it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie , so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed . the movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids . i ca n't say i loved this movie , but then again i 'm not its target audience !
i never watched the 'next action hero ' show , and until reading the other comments here , did not know that this movie was the 'prize ' from that competition . i was just flipping channels and came across this , and found myself watching , dare eagerly , all the way to the end . yes , the plot 's been done ( the most dangerous game , etc . ) but i was hoping for , and almost received , the 'gotcha ' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end . i think the high-tech was overdone ( gps 's ) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider , but it nevertheless was not too overdone . the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod ( suspension of disbelief ) that was required of the viewer . do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate ? could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up ? pleeease . way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch , but keep it at least plausible , thank you very much . the final solution was good , but the ending was disappointing , with the after taste of a bad star trek episode . at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane , who does n't get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show . knock me out .
who can watch a movie , look at lucy liu and not be overjoyed . that woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress . that 's a tough combination to find now a days . and jeremy northam . i heard his name plenty of times , but i never really noticed him . my advice to hollywood is : `` use him more '' . now about the movie : i watched it in one of my graveyard shift . i do n't recommend that to anyone . it 's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that . i still ca n't believe i did n't see the ending coming . i 'm not gon na say what cause that 'll spoil the hole movie . although saying this is spoilment enough . now i 'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie . i love the dark mystic story , the actors did a good job & i love the directors ( natali ) work in the past . there 's not a big audience for this kind of thing , that 's also pretty risky . you know what , i 'm just gon na give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this . then again , 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement .
this film is an excellent military movie . it may not be an excellent hollywood movie , but that does not matter . hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment , but that is not the case with this movie . other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste , but  as a retired soldier  i appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted . the story itself has been told and retold several times over , but it remains for a professional soldier  and an african american at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew , and as it presents the us navy to the world . the story of brashear 's work to become a navy diver , and his life as a navy diver beyond his graduation , is not the only story that is presented . there i also the story of how master chief petty officer sunday defied the illegal order of his commanding officer that petty officer 2nd class brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did , and paid the price of a loss of one stripe and a change of assignment . it also told the true story how brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the atlantic ocean off the coast of spain in the 1950 's , and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself . this was a complex story that was worth telling , and i will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story , and i can tell from the deleted scenes on the dvd that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible . as a professional soldier , i was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner , and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner .
what great locations . a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens.this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days . good going folks ! . i can not wait to see what your next feature will be . i 'll be with you all the way .
i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story . the acting by nolte , lee , arkin and the supporting cast was superb . the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details .
a very enjoyable film , providing you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries . it may not come close to agatha christie or even thin man mysteries as a film noir , but it 's much more interesting than your typical `` boy meets girl '' or `` let 's put on a show '' backstage musical . as a musical , it 's no busby berkley or freed unit , but it can boost the classic `` coctails for two '' and the weird `` sweet marijuana '' . the film runs in real time during a stage show , opening night of the `` vanities '' , where a murder - and soon another - is discovered backstage . is the murderer found out before the curtain falls ? sure , but the search is fun , even though somewhat predictable and marred by outbursts of comic relief ( luckily in the shape of the shapely goddess of the chorus girls , toby wing ) . the stupid cop is just a bit too stupid , the leading hero is just a bit too likable , the leading lady a bit too gracious , the bitchy prima donna bit too bitchy , and the enamoured waif a bit too self-sacrificing , but as stereotypes go , they are pretty stylish . there 's a bevy of really gorgeous chorus girls , who are chosen even better than the girls for a busby berkley musical of the same period , who sometimes tend to be a bit on the plump side . yes , this film could have been much better than it is , and the duke ellington number is an embarrassment , but if you enjoy diving into old movies , this will prove to be a tremendously tantalizing trip .
the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly , our main actress , orked was seen in a chinese language class . later in the film , she was asked on why ( by mukhsin ) that she was sent to learn mandarin . her answer was simple for a child she is ; coz she 's already known the malay language well . it 's a bit of a romance one may thought of it , but once you 've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it , you 'll notice the typical elements of malaysia . the movie basically focuses on 10 year old orked who met 12 year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy 's game . running out of players , mukhsin ( who was new in that village ) was forced to allow orked into the game , in which she eagerly showed the male side of her . orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie , defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school-bullies , throwing one of the bully 's bag out from the school bus window , throwing punches and kicks on mukhsin 's brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth . both were awesome buddies , and stick closer than that , but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way , parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town . now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin , they started out as friends , but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr . you would notice , the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love . the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor . the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you 'd be stuck on the screen for a long time . you will love the movie for what it is , and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes , coz it means much more . as the movie envelopes around the two love birds , it also manages to find its lens towards orked 's parents , her mother who was educated in england , speaks very good english and in which , her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english , which was humor all the way indeed . let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie . and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness . often more than not , we do n't learn to laugh at ourselves , and when we do , we do it at the expense of others . it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned - often when we are ourselves , we do n't see the person in us we are , but when only when we are in another person 's body , then only would we learn to see who we really are . and that is how humor applies as well , more so than just dignity . the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be . the other focus of this movie was on how orked 's neighbor , a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife , and wanted to find another . pak koboi as what he 's nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend . the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife . the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it , having interrupting on other people 's business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use . after all , what goes around , comes around , and that 's probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her . in every time , being nice to people around you wo n't hurt at all , unless you have an ego to protect , but then again , what 's it worth ? the movie also centers around mukhsin 's brother , hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night , smoking , drinking , and also finding 'girls ' . he 's the total opposite of mukhsin , but that 's all perhaps because of family problems . both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them . i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself , but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all . she wanted us , me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves . movies in a way , take us out from our own body , places us in the character 's position , and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it . depending on the type and genre of the movie , you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you .
one of my favorite shows in the 80 's . after the first season , it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast . deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest borgnine 's character go at it with each other . the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season . unfortunately during those days , blacks did not last long on television shows . some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show . when it went to usa , it was disgusting ! ! !
my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughton 's `` night of the hunter '' which remains superb in my canon . but , it may have been supplanted by `` shower '' which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen . the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water , and the way that water can be made inspiration , and comfort , and cleansing , and etc . is the essence of the dao . it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar , and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism . i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation . both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image . yet , shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod . i revere both .
i absolutely loved this movie . i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd . the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy . the actors , in my opinion , did an excellent job . the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work . there is humor , drama and relationship issues all in good time . this requires 10 lines but i just ca n't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines . so sorry about this . what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it . i am looking forward to view again but it is n't available .
`` the color purple '' , is truly amazing . there is none like it , and i do n't think there ever will be . it 's a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on . the actors are flawless and the directing is superb . i absolutely loved it . a movie has never made me so happy . it is beautiful , that 's the best way to explain it .
forget the jaded comments that come before these . this is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting . well-acted , even by elizabeth berkley . recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change .
military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves . among the more prominent we have , ` officer and a gentleman ' , ` top gun ' , ` gi jane ' , and now ` men of honor ' . the fact that this one happened to be true does n't change the fact that the formula is the same . this film is probably most like ` gi jane ' since it focuses on the desegregation angle . the story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human-interest story among those mentioned above . carl brashear ( cuba gooding , jr. ) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle , and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film . unfortunately , director george tillman has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than brashear in favor of showing brashear in a constant state of adversity . billy sunday ( robert de niro ) is a central figure , and except for the initial scene , the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife , we do n't know much about him . for instance , brashear sees the scars on sunday 's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow , but there is no follow-up on that point . mr. pappy ( hal holbrook ) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him . the rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting . if a director is going to make a human-interest story , he needs to humanize the characters . cuba gooding jr. gives an outstanding performance as brashear . this is probably the best i 've seen him . this is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before , and he rises to the occasion . in ` jerry maguire ' , rod tidwell was a fascinating , but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle . brashear is much more complex and grounded , and the issues he faces are life crises , making the part far more challenging . this is an excellent recovery from gooding 's last role in ` chill factor ' , a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part . after a stint trying his hand as a comedian ( ` analyze this ' , ` the adventures of rocky & bullwinkle ' , ` meet the parents ' ) , robert deniro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance . deniro is n't a bad comedian , he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he should n't waste his time doing comedy . deniro endows billy sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul . it is a pleasure watching him work . it seems every film i watch lately has charlize theron in it . i saw ` the legend of bagger vance ' , ` men of honor ' and ` the yards ' right in a row and i was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 ( actually , she only did five ) . this was a minor role for theron , but she carried it off well and managed to stay with deniro step for step . david keith , who co-starred with richard gere in ` officer and a gentleman ' , has a cameo here the dvd has some interesting special features , including reflections by the real carl brashear and some deleted scenes . i enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one-dimensional presentation . i rated it a 7/10 . i 'm a sucker for underdog stories and i have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme . this film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director 's shortcomings .
there are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written , seminal tv show ( the `` godfather '' to x-files and buffy , etc . ) ; as a monster show ( it scared the hell out of me when i was a kid ! ) , or as a well-written/acted gumshoe/film-noir . it works on both levels . the scariness may have been diluted over the years ( it was made in the mid-70s ) , but i was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show ( via dvd ) that i actually enjoy it more now for the latter reasons . the late darren mcgavin is karl kolchak , an eccentric , tenacious , rumpled newsman/monster-hunter who , in pursuit of a story , always finds a supernatural angle ; much to the pain of kolchak 's over-stressed , put-upon boss tony vincenzo ( played with tremendous world-weariness by the also late , great simon oakland ; you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers ! ) . the interplay between these characters is crackling and witty ( much like star trek 's spock and mccoy , only more acidic ! ) . over the course of two pilot tv movies and a one-season series , kolchack fought vampires , robots , werewolves , witches , zombies , government conspiracies , aliens , and ancient legends ( sounds like the entire 9 yr. run of the x-files ! in one season ! ) . and kolchak did it first ! and as for composer gil melle 's cool , partly-whistled main title music ... well , x-files creator chris carter calls mike snow 's ( very similar ) x-files main title theme an 'homage . ' both themes work well ; leave it at that . and unlike many modern horror/sci-fi shows , most of kolchak 's monsters are shown in shadow , and in quick cuts ( effectively , and sometimes thankfully ; as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny ; but some still do ) . modern horror shows take note : less is more ! one of the few flaws of the show ( and it 's a small one ) is the over-use of sunny , california locales passing for windy city chicago . night gallery had the same issue ; unavoidable for a modest-budget , l.a. based show . and some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are ( now ) viewed as clichés ( the effeminate reporter , ron updike , always used for comic relief ; sweet , old lady/advice columnist emily ) . but , they all do have their moments to shine ( unlike many supporting tv characters since , cliché or not ! ) . kolchak is a timeless show , that serves as a template for many that followed . and carl kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre tv show ( agent mulder 's real dad ) . and as a footnote , i tried watching a few episodes of the new , `` re-imagining '' of the show . it 's an x-files clone ( a copy of a copy ? ) . and a bad one , at that . carl kolchak is now a model-pretty , angsty 30-something ( played dismally by a boring stuart townsend ) . and giving him a scully-type partner is also a lame idea ; it undermines kolchak as a lone , don quixote crusader ! and kolchak and vincenzo getting along ? where 's the tension ? the interplay ? that they chose to hang the kolchak name on this regurgitated bit o ' crap is a prime example of how not to do a remake : take a beloved cult series , scrape off everything unique about it , drain it of all character and color ( but keep the name ! need that cult cred ! ) , and voilà ! instant re-hash ! it gets an ' f ' in 're-imaginings 101 ' ! this new version deserved the axe ! stick with the short-lived , but classic original . it truly gets better with age .
this gloriously turgid melodrama represents douglas sirk at his most high strung . it eschews the soft wistfulness of `` all that heaven allows '' and the weepy sentimentality of `` imitation of life '' and instead goes for feverish angst and overheated tension . and of course , it 's all captured in vibrant technicolor . the cornball story has something to do with a friendship between rock hudson and robert stack that becomes a rivalry when hudson snags the affections of lauren bacall , but who 's really paying attention to the story ? dorothy malone won a best supporting actress academy award for her splendidly over-the-top performance as stack 's sister , who takes the family business into her own hands when no one else will . a highlight of the film comes when this high-spirited wild child breaks into a frantic dance in her bedroom , unable to bear the restraints placed upon her by middle-class propriety . as so frequently happens in sirk movies , the scene is both unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity and yet strangely moving in its effectiveness . sirk came closer than anyone else to turning pure camp into high art , satisfying the philistines and the high brows at the same time within the same films . his was a unique talent and i do n't know that there 's ever been another film maker quite like him since . grade : a-
i rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim .. i like alan arkin and the cover was catching ... i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen ... i guess i got lucky .. i laughed from beginning to end .. alan arkin brings a great character to this movie . i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time .. i have recommeded this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did ... i see complaints about the menus and dvd functions .. but it does n't take away from the movie .. the disk was authored for blockbuster exculsivley which is why they did n't allow you to skip past the previews .. aside from that you should n't let the functions of the dvd to deterr you from watching the excellent film .
tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle . some men come looking for ivory and to take jane back to civilization . but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave . one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means killing tarzan . this is a rarity -- a sequel that 's better than the original . `` tarzan , the ape man '' of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged . this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult . there is tons of blatant racism ( a black man is shot to death point blank -- and no one really cares ) but this was 1934 . there 's also plenty of blood , gore and violence ( for a 1934 movie ) and uncut prints have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude ! there 's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and ( it 's implied ) they sleep together and have sex -- without being married . this would n't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme . that aside , the movie is well-directed , very fast-moving and full of adventure and excitement . seeing weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane 's outfit is pretty revealing too . i still think maureen o'sullivan is bad as jane but weismuller is perfect as tarzan . everybody else is ok . this is easily the best weismuller -- o'hara tarzan out there . well worth seeing but not for kids !
wow . a truly fantastic 'trip ' movie that has tons of super-surreal imagery , dark intent and a black , pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world . it 's populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds.as with all cool fantasy , the wandering plot is secondary to the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death , deluge , water elephants , samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish . i 'd never heard of it , but now i love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of american cartoonist ; bill plympton . it 's a demented delight for fans of odd , pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i 'd miss something amazing . simply put , it 's 'hello kitty ' without the ' o ' .
few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later , yet remain as engrossing as this one . technological advances have not dated this classic love story . special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie . the acting is superb . david niven , kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job . the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie . it has n't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence . it is my favorite movie of all time . waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is , in itself , `` a matter of life and death '' .
two movies back to back which dealt with indian pows ; veer zaara and deewaar . although veer zara was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone , deewaar focuses on the main subject itself . it is not hidden that many indian pows are rotting in pakistani jails for years - for whom neither indian govt . has time or sympathy nor the other side . i 'm sure some of pakistani pows are in india as well , but let 's focus on the movie . full of actors . some were stage actors like raghubir yadav , rajendra gupta , etc . amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major , acted well . akshaye khanna did his part well . there was nothing for amrita rao to do than a few giggles and couple songs . i think sanjay dutt 's role was most solid even though it was n't too long . he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive . if you compare it to loc , which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions ( if it had a story ) - deewaar is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors . 7.5/10
a journey of discovery , this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy , island town in british columbia . languorous and dreamy , the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young , fresh-faced teacher , with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland . slowly , their indolent state is awakened , the father ( and principal of the local school ) looks for excitement , the mother for stability , the oldest daughter for love , and the youngest for power . while not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of cinema , the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing . unfortunately , i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible .
this is actually one of my favorite films , i would recommend that everyone watches it . there is some great acting in it and it shows that not all `` good '' films are american ....
i watched this movie after watching practical magic , and the older film was far superior . i liked the way the lighting , makeup , and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story . jimmy stewart 's mannerisms did n't do a lot for me in this film , but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of gillian 's character . i was also struck by nicky 's and gillian 's mannerisms -- it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine . the gestures nicky makes when he 's showing redlich his powers especially struck me . i 've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate , so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters .
never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors . in the period that this film was made , people in america were different , there was no tv or all the modern things we have today , except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood . sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today . ann shirley , '' murder my sweet '' , '44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks , who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley . it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened , the entire town found out about it within minutes . it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living . today , it seems very corn ball and stupid , but believe me , this was the way people were in america during the 1920 ' . & 30 's and they were a great generation that loved good family films .
touching and sad movie . portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident . the film centers on his relationship with his married lover , whom he is often very hostile towards , and his interactions with other accident victims , particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker . the film is often humorous , often sad , and always believable . get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner .
what a brilliant film . i will admit it is very ambitious , with the subject matter . at a little over two and a half hours , it is a very long film too . but neither of these pointers are flaws in any way . cry freedom , despite the minor flaws it may have , is a powerful , moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist steve biko in his struggles to awaken south africa to the horrors of the apartheid . it is true , that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact . people have also complained that the film suffers from too much woods not enough biko . i may be wrong , but although it is biko 's story , it is told in the perspective of woods , so woods is an important character in conveying biko 's story to the world . cry freedom visually looks amazing . with the show-stopping cinematography and the stunning south african scenery it was a visual feast . the opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot . george fenton 's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes . it was subtle in scenes in the second half , but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes . the script was of exceptional quality , the courtroom scenes with biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff . the first half with biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about , whether it was the police 's attack of the south african citizens or biko 's death . the second half entirely about donald woods carries less of an emotional punch , but is compensated by how it is shot , performed and written . and there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well . the performances were exceptional from the entire cast , from the most minor character to the two leads , there was n't a single bad performance . regardless of the accents that is , but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in . denzel washington in one of his more understated performances , gives a truly compelling performance as biko , and kevin kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy , for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of washington 's . and the two men 's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note . penelope wilton is lovely as donald 's wife wendy , and she is a great actress anyway . out the supporting performances , and there may be some bias , two stood out for me . one was timothy west , who relishes his role as captain dewet . the other was the ever exceptional john thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameo-role as kruger . lord richard attenborough 's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual . overall , a truly wonderful film . ambitious and long it is , but never ceases to be compelling , powerful and achingly moving . a definite winner from lord richard attenborough , and worthy of a lot more praise . 10/10 bethany cox
paulie sounds like the most saccharine , lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find , yet it 's actually much better than you might expect . the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film , but actually in most other departments the film is charming . in case you 're wondering , paulie is a parrot . bought for a little girl with speech difficulties , paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her . he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons , and eventually becomes a super-intelligent speaker himself . however , paulie is sent away by the little girl 's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from n.y.c to l.a to be re-united with her . so , why does this awful-sounding film succeed relatively well ? firstly , it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects . secondly ( and far more significantly ) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving , often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline . thirdly , it has several surprisingly strong performances , including jay mohr as a wily crook , gena rowlands as a kind old lady , and cheech marin ( yes , the dope-smoking cheech marin ! ) as a musical immigrant . it might not be a classic , but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages .
wonderful movie with good story great humour ( some great one-liners ) and a soundtrack to die for . i 've seen it 3 times so far . the american audiences are going to love it .
i must admit , at first i was n't expecting anything good , at all . i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt 's and hyde 's image , but i 'm glad to say it has much more to offer . yes , the acting is not that great , but it does n't suck either , all the cast 's well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters . effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough . what really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline , although it merges fantastic elements , it also displays a crude reality . the developing of the characters , their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that 's the key of this movie . it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst . it fulfills any expectations for a good drama . i would definitely recommend it to everyone .
this movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in british columbia , canada . the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing ( set in california & late 60's-80 's ) were well conceived.i believe this is the best & most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo & the bay area from 1968-19 ? ( he was never caught ) .edward james olmos ( det . dave toschi ) & george dzundza ( zodiac-at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen , since cleared by dna & fingerprints ) play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together , each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing dzundza did it , still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed ( like all serial killers ) to the carnage left in his wake.the only disappointment was the '' over the top '' ending otherwise pretty accurate.if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case , check it out .
i recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much . it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor/actress to get people , any people to come see it and give the movie exposure . bobby myeres played by modine and his partner saul - paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bates , a `` name '' actor played by alan bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie . my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated debra kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie . if you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you . low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content .
a lonely depressed french boy mathieu ( jeremie elkaim ) on vacation in the summer , meets and falls in love with cedric ( the gorgeous stephane rideau ) . quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie . on one hand , i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys . on the other i was getting annoyed -- the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason . it 's very confusing and pointless . spoilers ahead ! ! ! also there are tons of plot holes -- mathieu , at one point , does something that ends him up in the hospital . what is it -- we 're never told ! then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he 's living with him . why ? we 're not told . then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end . why ? no explanation . it 's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so ... however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much . if only things were explained ! elkaim as mathieu is not good . he 's tall , handsome and has a nice body -- but he ca n't act . his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face -- all the time . rideau , on the other hand , is great . he 's very handsome , has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor . also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him . there is full frontal male nudity , lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great -- most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes . this one does n't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other . so , a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing -- especially for rideau 's nude scenes -- that is , if you like good-looking nude young men !
a shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern british films , one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that american films are judged . britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it , but at warmth british films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor . this film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor , so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers . it 's a couple of decades later , gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind . he teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses . when students he 's fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he 's just all talk . this is a subversive film in that there 's not the usual worldly character of any american movie that you expect to do whatever he does , but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles . maybe . it 's certainly no protest-by-numbers though , being too warm . where u.s. film may seem realistic because they 're urban and gritty , this and other british films of recent years - those that do n't try to match america for visceral thrills - are real because british humour reveals truths .
'the adventures of barry mckenzie ' started life as a satirical comic strip in 'private eye ' , written by barry humphries and based on an idea by peter cook . mckenzie ( 'bazza ' to his friends ) is a lanky , loud , hat-wearing australian whose two main interests in life are sex ( despite never having had any ) and fosters lager . in 1972 , he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings . it must have been tempting for humphries to cast himself as 'bazza ' , but he wisely left the job to barry crocker ( later to sing the theme to the television soap opera 'neighbours ' ! ) . humphries instead played multiple roles in true peter sellers fashion , most notably bazza 's overbearing aunt 'edna everage ' ( this was before she became a dame ) . you know this is not going to be 'the importance of being ernest ' when its censorship classification n.p.a . stands for 'no poofters allowed ' . pom-hating bazza is told by a sydney solicitor that in order to inherit a share in his father 's will he must go to england to absorb british culture . with aunt edna in tow , he catches a quantas flight to hong kong , and then on to london . an over-efficient customs officer makes bazza pay import duties on everything he bought over there , including a suitcase full of 'tubes of fosters lager ' . as he puts it : `` when it comes to fleecing you , the poms have got the edge on the gyppos ! '' . a crafty taxi driver ( bernard spear ) maximises the fare by taking bazza and edna first to stonehenge , then scotland . the streets of london are filthy , and their hotel is a hovel run by a seedy landlord ( spike milligan ) who makes bazza put pound notes in the electricity meter every twenty minutes . there is some good news for our hero though ; he meets up with other aussies in earls court , and fosters is on sale in british pubs . what happens next is a series of comical escapades that take bazza from starring in his own cigarette commercial , putting curry down his pants in the belief it is some form of aphrodisiac , a bizarre encounter with dennis price as an upper-class pervert who loves being spanked while wearing a schoolboy 's uniform , a young conservative dance in rickmansworth to a charity rock concert where his song about 'chundering ' ( vomiting ) almost makes him an international star , and finally to the b.b.c . t.v . centre where he pulls his pants down on a live talk-show hosted by the thinking man 's crumpet herself , joan bakewell . a fire breaks out , and bazza 's friends come to the rescue - downing cans of fosters , they urinate on the flames en masse . this is a far cry from bruce beresford 's later works - 'breaker morant ' and 'driving miss daisy ' . on release , it was savaged by critics for being too 'vulgar ' . well , yes , it is , but it is also great non-p.c . fun . 'bazza ' is a disgusting creation , but his zest for life is unmistakable , you can not help but like the guy . his various euphemisms for urinating ( 'point percy at the porcelain ' ) and vomiting ( 'the technicolour yawn ' ) have passed into the english language without a lot of people knowing where they came from . other guest stars include dick bentley ( as a detective who chases bazza everywhere ) , peter cook , julie covington ( later to star in 'rock follies ' ) , and even future arts presenter russell davies . a sequel - the wonderfully-named 'barry mckenzie holds his own - came out two years later . at its premiere , humphries took the opportunity to blast the critics who had savaged the first film . good for him . what must have been of greater concern to him , though , was the release of 'crocodile dundee ' in 1985 . it also featured a lanky , hat-wearing aussie struggling to come to terms with a foreign culture . and made tonnes more money . the song on the end credits ( performed by snacka fitzgibbon ) is magnificent . you have a love a lyric that includes the line : `` if you want to send your sister in a frenzy , introduce her to barry mckenzie ! '' . time to end this review . i have to go the dunny to shake hands with the unemployed ...
fascinating movie , based on a true story , about an australian woman , lindy chamberlain ( meryl streep ) accused of killing her baby daughter . she insists that a dingo took her baby , but the story is highly suspicious . the film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case , the way australians interpreted what was presented in the media , and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman 's conviction , based on barely any hard evidence . i love films that question the media , and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system . i 've always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 angry men before they go through with their duties . it 's not , as has often been said , a liberal movie , but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events based so much on our prejudices and a desire for revenge . a cry in the dark is likewise clinical . schepisi is careful not to make the film at all melodramatic . some may find the film boring or dry , but i found it engaging .
i loved the way earth is made . its photography is unbelievable , editing it must have been an interesting challenge and patrick stewart 's voice over is perfect . in addition its music and sound editing make watching earth a profound experience you do n't want to miss . you really are on a journey to where you would probably never-ever end up by yourself . and although , at first , i was quite surprised by the laughter of the audience as we see animals in their daily fight for survival , i could not help laughing myself sometimes . nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend . but , rather than the need to laugh , i left the cinema with a profound question : '' howcome 200 years of industrial revolution can destroy natural systems that have been here for thousands and thousands of years ? '' with this question in mind , you 'll understand how i felt somewhat bitter and powerless after seeing earth . i felt the immediate need to change the world , to help all these animals in their struggle , to undo the changes we have gone through the last centuries and to stop the global heating at once ( all that not being a ngo activist at all ! ) ... so i immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the film to see what i could do to save our -still- fantastic planet ( and the polar bear ) from its depressing fate ... ( www.loveearth.com ) i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there . yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through . i hope that cutting on my energy-use will do . i do n't know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they can not beat in their exhausted state ... an inspiring film it is , but i did n't leave the cinema feeling very happy .
my favorite `` imperialism '' movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time . grant , mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most `` pc '' of film goers . memorable scenes abound -- the 3 sergeants and their 20 sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs ; macchesney & cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch ( `` save some for the elephant '' ) ; cutter to macchesney -- `` i 'm an expedition '' ; din breaking cutter out of jail , with a fork ( `` what do you think i 'm trying to break out of ? a bleedin ' pudding ? ! ) and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing , bold as brass -- `` all right , you 're all under arrest ! '' i could go on , but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on . for armchair adventurers and generals , it 's hard to imagine a better 2 hours .
wwe has produced some of the worst pay-per-views in its history over the past few months . cyber sunday , survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its b brand show , smackdown ! to attempt to end the year on a high note . armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches , three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay . however , it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present . t-lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions , london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to a four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz . i am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing i can say would be able to do it justice . this has to be seen to be believed . there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings . the one move i have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest . jeff hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force . unfortunately for mercury he did n't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye . this was vicious . his face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury 's night early . we found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye . be warned . this is not for the faint of heart . the ending to this roller-coaster of a match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory . i have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it does n't get any better than this match . unbelievable . the night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match . kane took on mvp in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action . there were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring . mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this . may i suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown ! to johnny cash 's ring of fire . the other gimmick match of the night , and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker . this was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet . the used poles , chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor . unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd did n't pop for this . the ending came after a chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match-winning tombstone . in other notable happening from the card . chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match . this was a very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time . benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not . luckily he came to his senses and let her go . this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission . another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe , gregory helms and jimmy wang yang . featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots , some of which took place outside the ring , this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got . jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond , virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant . helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns ! resident redneck . the boogeyman pinned the miz in a worthless match . i hate the boogeyman with a passion . only worth listening too for jbl 's ranting about miz . jbl is comedy gold . the last match of the night was main event number 3 . world heavyweight champion , batista and wwe champion , john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions , king booker . there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less . the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have i said that about wwe matches this year already . it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big batistabomb . so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it 's pay-per-view schedule . it started the year on a terrible note with new year 's revolution but ended on a high one with armageddon . this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time . my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match .
this is a very fine and poetic story . beautiful scenery . magnificent music score . i 've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling . the movement of the camera is superb , as well as the actors . it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic . japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it 's all very well brought onto the screen here . the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details . once you 've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director . it 's a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody .
damon runyon 's world of times square , in new york , prior to its disneyfication , is the basis for this musical . joseph l. mankiewicz , a man who knew about movies , directed this nostalgic tribute to the `` crossroads of the world '' that show us that underside of new york of the past . frank loesser 's music sounds great . we watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . people at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights , the action , the possibilities in that part of town . this underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense . some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . we do n't know whether this makes sense , but this is not unusual for a hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . that original cast included the wonderful vivian blaine and stubby kaye , and we wonder about the decision of not letting robert alda , sam levene , isabel bigley repeat their original roles . these were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution . the film , visually , is amazing . the look follows closely the fashions of the times . as far as the casting of marlon brando , otherwise not known for his singing abilities , frank sinatra and jean simmons , seem to work in the film . sky masterson is , after all , a man 's man , who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different 'look ' . frank sinatra is good as nathan detroit . jean simmons , as sarah brown , does a nice job portraying the woman from the salvation army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save . vivian blaine is a delight . she never ceases to amaze as miss adelaide , a woman with a heart of gold who 's nathan detroit 's love interest . ms. blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . stubby kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his nicely nicely johnson . the wonderful production owes a lot to the talented abe burrows , who made the adaptation to the screen . the costumes by irene sharaff set the right tone .
for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure . the story starts at the turn of the century ( 1900 ) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times ( i.e . the 1960s ) . the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village , who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era . he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village . his son , by the local beauty , fights the germans during the second world war . when he returns to the village , the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism . this film is long and slow , but utterly logic and very well made . it can be seen in three parts .
an absolutely brilliant film ! jiri trnka , the master of puppet animation , confronts totalitarianism in this , his final , film . it would be banned by the communist czechoslovakian government ( at the time ) , despite taking the country 's highest animation award . in this dark and entertaining short film , an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant . he happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose . all of a sudden , he here 's a knock at the door , and in comes this giant omnipotent hand , that tries to force the artist to make statues in it 's likeness . the artist resists as best he can , but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts , by the hand , to force him to conform . he becomes brainwashed ; an intellectual zombie . at this point the hand attaches strings to the artist , puts him in a cage , and uses him to make hand statues . all the while glorifying the artist 's work and awarding him with medals and honours . the artist 's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination , and enables him escape his prison , whether it be literal or in his mind , and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand . he shuts himself in , thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand , but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high , hoping it is out of the reach of the hand , and it ends up falling on his head , killing him . the artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation . all because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand 's strings . once dead , the hand paints the artist as a great person , a national hero . unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered . trnka 's condemnation of totalitarian society , and their lack of right for free expression is dark , damning and an amazingly animated . it is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire , and would perhaps even listen to . that was obviously not acceptable . an amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have . and still quite relevant today for many parts of the world , from the us to the middle east . a must see and definite 10 out of 10 ! talk about going out with a bang !
starring : jim carrey , morgan freeman , jennifer anniston i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie . i mean , what a conceptual nightmare . jim carrey playing god ? nothing is sacred anymore . well , this movie is hardly sacred , but it also is not sacrilegious , at least not to any great extent . yes , jim carrey has the powers of god for a while , but he is not god . confused ? i 'll give you the low down . jim carrey plays bruce nolan , a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . he lives with his beautiful girlfriend , grace ( anniston ) , and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other , but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground . then bruce gets a shot at anchorman , only to have it underhandedly stolen by evan baxter . obviously not please , bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired . much complaining and griping about god later , bruce gets a page . after a while he gets tired of it calling , so he responds and goes to the omni presents building ( heh ) . there he meets god ( freeman ) , who is the boss , electrician , and janitor of the building . i found this highly amusing . god is the boss , the holy spirit is the electrician , and jesus christ is the janitor . think about it . boss , obvious . electrician , the guy who keeps everything running . janitor , the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . brilliant . anyway , bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god , but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god , he starts to believe a bit . wonder why . enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies . since this is hollywood , bruce obviously eventually smartens up , learns his lesson , and starts using his powers for the good of the world . in the end he cries out for god to take it away and prays that his will be done , not bruce 's . since it is jim carrey , the movie is quite amusing , and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . the movie is not perfect theology , but for hollywood , it is definitely a good attempt . many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging , and i applaud tom shadyac for his effort in this movie . so , while far from perfect , definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it . bottom line : 3.5 out of 4 ( worth a view or two )
if you like plot turns , this is your movie . it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next . nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will . the characters are all gritty and engaging . cage is at his best . dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side . jt walsh is perfect in his last performance . laura boyle sizzles . dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo . i categorize this movie as `` i am having a really , really , really bad day '' film . not a slow minute in this film . a real sleeper . this movie is underrated and , sadly , overlooked .
so-so thriller starring brad pitt and juliette lewis , who join david duchovny and michelle forbes on a road trip out west . the latter couple are researching notorious murder sites for an upcoming book ; pitt 's a serial killer on the lam ( unbeknownst to dave ) and juliette is his poor , not-all-there companion . this is a good cast and the story moves along , but pitt is n't belivably scary as a serial killer , although it is one of his better earlier roles . the best thing is here is michelle forbes , who always manages to shine , whether in her roles on ` homicide : life on the street ' or in the brief series ` wonderland . ' vote : 6
it takes a serbian or at least a balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations , characters and jokes of 'zavet ' as well as of many other films of kusturica . see for example the opening scenes , with the remote village in the serbian mountains , with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants , the nostalgia for the good days of the communist rule , and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the soviet hymn . kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of serbia described in his previous movies , but creates a whole world of himself in the process . this is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case . it 's a fun film before all . kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about . music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies . his style is direct and grotesque , we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same . the space he develops melds present , history and magic , and the colours seem to be of a douanier rousseau of modern cinema . this is not a perfect film either . the principal flaw is the length , some editing and shortening would have been useful , as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up . it is yet one of the most catching , amusing , moving films that i have seen lately .
this noir may not be the best remembered film from the era , but it features a great mystery plot , the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members . robert siodmak , the talented director behind the mystery/horror classic 'the spiral staircase ' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film , and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer . phantom lady focuses on scott henderson ; a man married to a woman he does n't like . he picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night , and the two agree to a 'no strings attached ' night of fun . however , he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! he 's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her , and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife . however , luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case ... the plot moves along nicely throughout , and unlike many of the better known noirs , this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting . in fact , if it was n't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white , i would swear phantom lady was an italian giallo ! the central characters are all interesting enough , with alan curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim , and ella raines being effective as the female impromptu detective . the real standout of the film , however , is franchot tone , who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece . the film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire elisha cook jr , who features playing the drums in the film 's most memorable segment . if i was to criticise this film , i would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although phantom lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , phantom lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen noirs ever made !
the devil 's plaything is my second attempt at a joseph sarno production - and although i will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic swedish wildcats , it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste . this one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle , that want to resurrect their previously murdered `` leader '' . in order to do so , the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood , too . when a doctor and her brother 's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires ... but they may not be as helpless as they seem ... the devil 's plaything is a pretty good example of early 70 's exploit sleaze . lots of nudity - including some full-frontal , some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course , lesbo-bloodsucking ... but these scenes are still pretty tame by today 's standards . some pretty hot women in this one , would have benefited from some more explicit sex , but i guess ya ca n't have it all . also would have benefited from some heavier violence/gore , being that it is a vampire film , but i think the purpose of the devil 's plaything was more to showcase skin , not blood . still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that 's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget . worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking . 7/10
this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 , with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ... ok , it 's not really stupid but it 's cheesy fun . i saw many similarities between this and 'creature with the blue hand ' ( aka the bloody dead ) and they do have the same director ! scotland yard 's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college . seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done . there 's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid , and there 's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine , it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire . joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance . there 's a `` monk '' , and how anyone identifies this thing as a `` monk '' is beyond me , it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood , more of a klan member of a different color than a monk . there 's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk , and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight , a nifty trick right there . this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones , and while it 's rather silly at times it is fun to watch . 7 out of 10 , not bad ....
i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family jeopardy , a romantic love story , and a very sad story plot . everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film . it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards . with the mention of beautiful scenario , and although i would relate this film to the notebook and the family stone , it was sort of much more cunning , sad , and brilliant than those films . the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years , and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well . the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat . you really get to know all the characters and by the end , i was wanting to watch it all over again . this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is . all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go . i loved it , and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film ...
infamous pre-code film , really the one film that caused people to insist on the hayes code being strictly enforced . barbara stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers . when he dies in an accident , she 's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants . she goes to new york and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder , one bed at a time . although obviously there 's no actual sex shown , the film is quite sleazy . unfortunately , after the initial shock value fades ( around the time stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free ) , the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull . stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through . as always , she 's fantastic .
the 1st season was amazing , the whole idea of them adjusting to the island , while mysteries were being explored ( and seen ) was just phenomenal ; filled with suspense , tons of cliffhangers , and an amazing plot . i mean , i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island . and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention . from then on , i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season , only a little better . i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative . the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious , creepy , and exciting . i loved all the suspense surround others on the island , but the dharma story really made season 2 amazing . season 3 was n't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless , great . i loved seeing the back-stories of the others , seeing their camp , and seeing the mysteries further explored . ( `` tricia tanak is dead '' is one of my favorite episodes ) . this season , while not as good , was still breathtaking and fun , but most of all exciting ! now , the 4th season . i had hopes for this season , and the 1st couple of episodes we 're good , but then it really started to get boring and monotonous . i mean , i really despise the new `` rescuers '' such as miles and daniel . the plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and most of all .... season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series : the mystery , suspense , comedy mixed in ( charlie gone ) and overall excitement . also , some of my favorite characters have left .
well , i come from bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be `` very , very afraid '' ! ! ! this guy ( devon sawa ) has done a great job with this movie ! i do n't know exactly how old he was but he did n't act like a child ( well done ) ! now about the tornado-it was n't very realistic but frightens you ! if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie !
this is such a great movie to watch with young children . i 'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over . gena was good , cheech was fun , the russian was good , maria was adorable & of course paulie was the best !
`` shall we dance ? `` , a light-hearted flick from japan , tells of an overworked accountant and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he see 's from the train during his daily commute . what he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and , most of all , himself . funny , poignant , and utterly charming , `` swd '' is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers . ( b )
while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti-vietnam , while watching it i did n't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public did n't support .... it showed their fear , their desperation , their drive ... all of it , out in the open , naked . as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp . on the whole this movie , although it was shot on a very small budget , looks great , is very well put together , and features excellent acting and directing . i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film . 10/10
and i absolutely adore isabelle blais ! ! ! she was so cute in this movie , and far different from her role in `` quebec-montreal '' where she was more like a man-eater . i think she should have been nominated for a jutra . i mean , syvlie moreau was good , but isabelle was far superior , imo . pelletier has done fine work for his first time out , and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from rock et belles oreilles , guy a. lepage & andre ducharme . it was fun to see them in this , i did n't know they were going to appear . i do n't think i 've seen a romantic comedy from quebec that i did n't like , and this one is as good as any i 've had the pleasure to see . and if you 're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd , www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week .
one of the ten best comedies ever this seems a comedy so joyous and light that sings . keaton 's comedies are _innerly , harmoniously , intelligently ordered , thought . wonderfully amusing , deliberately delightful and inventive , three ages should belong to a draft of a comedies top ten if i were to sketch one . a threefold love story will enchant the viewers ; i want to bring here this approachkeaton 's comedy is like lang 's destiny upsidedownor à rebours . again a couple traverses the waters of timeand of epochsin the stone age , in rome and in keaton 's timesin a mohammedan country , in renaissance italy and in china . the same device works in the both moviesone , a grim , eerie melodrama ; -- the other , a light , virtuouslypaced comedy . at keaton it 's essentially the same couple ; and maybe the same is with lang . the babe desired by both buster and beery is nice . i have found three ages well written and smart , without being ostentatiously sophisticated ; the plot is basically very popeyelikethe babe is a piece of furniture , the only protagonists are the two male rivalskeaton and beery . keaton 's movie is simply enormously likable , and perhaps one would be tempted to assert this looks like ambitious funyet it 's not , but it is grand fun , large fun , ample fun . and wallace beery makes a fine nemesis .
i was surprised , that `` the secret fury '' was an enjoyable good film ...... probably because , i did n't have any expectations for this movie ..... though , the film does have it 's plot holes ..... i would say , that you could n't guess who was behind the whole scheme , until the very end of the movie ..... at first , i thought , it was robert ryan , using the same method , like `` gaslight '' where husband tries to drive his wife mad , but i was wrong ...... the main problem , with the movie is , they drive at a whole other direction , which gave no clues at the beginning ...... i thought , robert ryan & claudette colbert carried their parts well ...... plus , vivian vance , a fine character actress , who steals scenes in this one ...... those who like movies , that keeps you guessing , will like this one ......
loved this show ... smart acting , smart dialog , great storyline with real people .... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. hope davis really shines in this show . i like the idea of six degrees ... it really makes sense in this insane world . rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to grovel .. but please ! when it went off the air , i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal interruptions , in fact , online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime time ... gone are the days of endless taping . anytime you want to bring it back , i am ready .
another pokemon movie has hit the theaters , and again , i 'm hearing the same old , `` pokemon is dead , blah blah blah . '' the franchise 's detractors could n't be more wrong . kids are still playing the trading card game , they 're still watching the tv series , they 're waiting for the game boy advance games , and they want to see `` pokemon the 4th movie . '' that said , `` pokemon the 4th movie '' introduces us to two more `` legendary '' pokemon : suicune , the `` north wind '' of lore , and celebi , guardian of the forest ( and star of the show ) . celebi transports itself and a boy named sam 40 years into the future , to the present day , where pokemon trainer ash , his faithful pikachu , and his friends brock and misty are traveling through johto . sam and ash become fast friends , once they discover the other 's mutual love for pokemon ( sam 's vintage pokeball with screw-on top is a great moment ) . together , they decide to protect celebi from the villain of the story , the team rocket agent aptly named vicious , who is hell-bent on capturing celebi for his own ends . will ash and sam be able to protect celebi from vicious ' dark balls ? where does suicune fit into the picture ? will jessie , james , and meowth have bigger parts in this movie than before ? and just who is sam , really ? like with the first 3 movies , if you go into the movie deciding that you 're automatically going to hate it no matter what simply because it 's pokemon ( or just because your child/niece/nephew/younger sibling/et cetera `` dragged '' you into it ) , then you 're going to hate it because you 've decided that you want to hate it . that may be , but to blindly trash `` pokemon the 4th movie '' simply because it is a pokemon movie , and especially without having seen it , is just plain stupid . even non-fans can enjoy this movie without having to know every last detail of the world of pokemon . i 'm not saying that you will become a pokemon fan because of this movie , but you can indeed enjoy it , if you 'll let yourself . unlike the first 3 pokemon movies , `` pokemon the 4th movie '' is being distributed by miramax , who i 've heard is also working on securing the rights to the 5th pokemon movie , which was released this past summer in japan . miramax claims to have some boffo-aggressive marketing strategy for `` pokemon the 4th movie , '' but all i 've seen so far is a feeble limited release , which does n't include the usual pikachu short in the beginning , which i was really looking forward to this time . i hope that miramax will see fit to put the pikachu short , called `` pikachu 's exciting hide-and-seek , '' onto at least the dvd/vhs release , if not with a future wider release of `` pokemon the 4th movie . '' i hope that the current release is just the tip of the iceberg for this very entertaining film .
this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion , with cool characters , lots of action , and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren , however alex karzis is awful as the villain ! . the story is very good , and i found the kids to be likable for the most part , plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this ! . the action scenes are excellent , and it 's almost like die hard except it 's set in a school ! , plus kata dobó is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick ! . the finale is very exciting , and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well ! , however i just wished it had another villain , because alex karzis just did n't cut it as the villain way too ott , and laughable for my tastes . this should be higher then 4.1 in my opinion , as i thought it was a great action film , and while the kids , were very stupid at times , they got quite resourceful as the movie went along ! , plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well ! . the ending is very amusing , and corey sevier 's character was my favorite student ! , plus dolph has still got it ! . this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion , with cool characters , lots of action , and an amazing performance from lundgren ! , but alex karzis is awful as the villain , still i highly recommend this one ! . the direction is very good ! . sidney j. furie does a very good job here with great camera work , good angles , and keeping the film at a very fast pace ! . there is a bit of blood and violence . we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds , knife in the side of the head , bloody arrow hits , an impaling , and other minor stuff . the acting is fantastic ! . dolph lundgren is amazing as always , and is amazing here , he is extremely likable , kicks that ass as usual , had great chemistry with the kids , had an awesome character , is very charismatic , and he may not have shown a great emotional rage , he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch ! , he is one of my favorite actors ! ( lundgren rules ! ! ! ! ! ) . alex karzis is god awful as the villain , he is laughably ott , was boring , and not menacing at all , he also annoyed the crap out of me . kata dobó is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do , she was the real villain in my opinion ! . corey sevier is funny as mick , he was my favorite student , and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half , i liked him a lot ! , he had good chemistry with dolph too . dov tiefenbach ( willy ) , chris collins ( hogie ) , mpho koaho ( jay tee ) , danielle hampton ( alicia ) , nicole dicker ( charlee ) all do great as the students . jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fiancée . rest of the cast do fine . overall i highly recommend this one ! . * * * 1/2 out of 5
after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind , dorothy malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister/wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them . she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps -- and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role , malone won a best supporting actress oscar . the film she 's in is not quite up to oscar standards , but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk 's capable hands . there 's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson , lauren bacall , robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners . domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama , with the accent on the strong supporting players , stack and malone . both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack , too , should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak , alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives . the nominal stars have less impressive work to do , but do it with their usual skill and conviction -- hudson and bacall . they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding . the use of color is particularly striking ( as it usually is in a sirk film ) and yet it does n't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven . well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast .
before she went into politics or public service , glenda jackson was one of britain 's finest film actresses . this film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes julie christie as kitty , the wife of a british royal captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years , and jenny played by american ann-margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister . alan bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during world war i . sir ian holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him . you see familiar faces like sheila keith , patsy byrne , and frank finlay . you ca n't help but watch glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the captain but they came from different classes . it 's not the greatest movie but it 's good to see glenda 's amazing talent . she is still a fantastic actress , comedy or drama . she makes margaret grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her .
i read that this did not well , that the story is not solid , that volckman feels he has failed in some way . i disagree . first , it is well executed . volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique , but to have a focus that is worth thinking about : would immortality reduce the value of life ? big question ... i can see he trying hard to build a feeling , and he is not compromising . this is to be applauded . i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form . i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment . i identify this film with this . further , it is much more interesting than richard linklater 's roto-scoping , and volckman 's story has more meaning than linklater 's later stories of a wasted life on drugs . old news . everyone knows it , but no one does anything about it . renaissance has more to offer , something new to think about . and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better . well done , volckman . really nice work .
saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted . the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind , and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting . all of the character were so authentic to me , i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom . go and see it ! you 'll cry your heart out , but you 'll experience a wonderful catharsis ! besides , it teaches you one important lesson : determination is everything . you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin , but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all . if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer . the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self-pity . it wo n't get you anywhere and the only person who 'll pity you will be yourself .
i watch them all . it 's not better than the amazing ones ( _strictly ballroom_ , _shall we dance ? _ ( japanese version ) , but it 's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts . i am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting . for example : the `` name should scream do n't watch . 'how she move . ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? '' there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar . it 's just not canadian standard english grammar . comments about the dialogue seem off to me . i put on the subtitles because i 'm a canadian standard english speaker , so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it . it was n't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so american . i loved that this movie was set in toronto and , in fact , wish it was even more clearly set there . i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast . i enjoyed the stepping routines . i liked the driven mum character . i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies . in summary , if you tend to like dance movies , then this is a decent one . if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking , your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie .
michelle rodrigez was made for this movie , when i first saw her in fast and the furious . you could tell that she was a tough woman . with this movie , she has not only proven her acting , but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie . she is more a bad girl and that 's what i like about her . this movie is about a troubled girl , living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family . as she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer , she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her . even though they do n't think she has the potential , they get to be shown proven wrong . i think this movie was a little slow at the ending , but was well done . it shows , that people can do anything even if they do n't think you have the potential . i recommend it to be seen .
this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general public 's misconception of it as a teen flick . it has wonderful performances , particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother , played by a convincing sally kellerman . the three girls that play jodie 's friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing .
i guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of `` beauty and the beast '' , but i ca n't say i 've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex . wow . anyway it seems that a young woman and her .. aunt ? have traveled to this castle in france where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner , who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off . it seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather , uh , frisky , i guess you could say , with the ladies , or at least , one in particular . there are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon-to-be-blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom 's father removes it from her sight . anyway , the young bride-to-be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to show up to the wedding ( a family member , i guess ) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her . the effects in this leave a little to be desired , and any attempt at eroticism ( not that i know much about that ) is kind of rendered laughable , especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat . this has a rather strange and abrupt , yet twist ending , with not really any clues or much build up to it , but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what i expected . i do n't know , this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird . 7 out of 10 .
a strange role for eddie murphy to take at the height of his career . while there is a lot of the `` eddie murphy character , '' he plays a truly decent person . the rest of the cast is good , particularly the lovely charlotte lewis . her character 's beauty and serenity held the tone of the film from getting to be too much murphy .
forbidden planet represents the kind of science fiction that is precious in cinema , especially from the 1950s . there was the day the earth stood still and war of the worlds , but lest not forget this gem which took some of its story from shakespeare 's the tempest to tell a tale of astronauts on a planet that has a doctor on it who has made a remarkable breakthrough . it 's the kind of breakthrough that is not so much incredible to look at ( though for 1956 it does look quite amazing to look at some of those sets and that gigantic machine the doctor creates ) , but with its emphasis on the characters and its themes of technology taken too far by the more primitive side of human nature even when we do n't know we 're channeling it . on the surface- that is in the first ten minutes- it looks standard , if a little more professionally acted and directed with better skill than the b-movies of the period . a ship of astronauts are on a mission to the planet altair-4 to bring back an expedition that went missing decades before . but the only one left is dr. morbis ( walter pidgeon ) and his daughter , who somehow were immune to an attack that left everyone else dead . morbius appears to be a cordial and highly intelligent man , and his technology looks to be so impressive that the only thing the astronauts , led by the skipper ( leslie nielsen ) , can think to do is to report it back to their superiors on earth . but there 's a catch - something is killing off members of the crew of the ship , one by one , every night , even when the others keep an eye out and then put up an invisible electric fence , which the invisible something goes through easily . meanwhile , there 's some romance possibly between the skipper and alraira , and there 's a more pushy vibe from the doctor : you should n't have come to the planet to start , and now you need to go . what happens from this is even more fascinating , just on a purely intellectual level , but forbidden planet never forgets that its audience should also be entertained by this story while getting some useful ideas . while everyone may remember robbie the robot , and for good reason , perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail , animated with red electricity and looking so beastly that it looks out of fantasia . the acting from pidgeon is subtle : you would n't expect him to be a villain , though something is there in the character and in the performance that speaks to this , and by the end it makes the character far more complex than one would expect . and the other performances are workmanlike but also excellent , from nielsen as a born leader to holliman providing some great comic relief as the cook ( who , i should add , helps with one of the funniest scenes in the film with those gallons of bourbon robbie provides ) . and the effects for its time are extraordinary ( sophisticated in a nostalgic pulp way for today too ) , and the music , done by electronics , is beautiful in its `` tones '' . but ultimately it 's the screenplay and careful direction from hilcox that puts this a notch above the rest of the b-movie lot . when it 's meant to be funny , it 's intentionally so and it works . when it 's dramatic it connects quite well even in its stiff moments with the actors . and when we are made to think about a horrible situation , it comes on gradually , with nuance , not shoved in our faces or injected with mega-action . an inspiration for many other sci-fi films , and a fine marker of thoughtful science fiction stories and books from time-old , it 's a classy and entertaining classic .
it 's actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond , as i 'm sure he would n't be able to keep up in the nowadays spying-business , where fast cars have been replaced with hi-tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment . `` cypher '' is a pretty inventive sci-fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright & claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible . you know the trend in these types of movies : nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot , the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again . the events in `` cypher '' supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world , where the major companies do n't really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other 's thunder . company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity , only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor , the sunways corporation . sunways , on the other hand , constantly tries to unmask the digisoft-rats and recruit them again as double-spies . in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan ; a seemingly colorless thirty-something employee who 's been selected by sebastian rooks ( the über-spy ) to diddle the secret policies of both companies . trust me , it 's actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali ( the dude from `` tube '' ) carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters . the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem `` seconds ''  starring rock hudson  as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style . even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60 's film , with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless . there 's also plenty of great action and suspense , most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing-techniques during boring conventions . the middle section of the film drags a little , mainly because you already realize that it 's all just building up towards multiple misleading plot-twists , and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not-so-distant future . jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side . regular director 's choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c. dunn . `` cypher '' is well made and adrenalin rushing sci-fi entertainment , highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time .
the movie is a fantasy . the story line is thin but serves as the structure upon which some wonderful songs are sung and sung beautifully . ( i still can not believe that such handsome and attractive people could sing this well . ) some of the dialog is wonderfully clever . the costumes made me feel as though i was watching a haute couture fashion show from 1942 . movies are designed to serve various purposes . this one is designed to entertain and it certainly does . if i have one negative comment it would be that nelson eddy was a little too old to be the handsome dashing count . some of the closeups made me uncomfortable . but he could still sing and sing magnificently . however , jeanette macdonald was just as dazzling as ever . she makes a spectacular angel . this genre is well before my time , and i an new to the jeanette macdonald/nelson eddy films and related conversation . the music in this movie is beautiful . as much as i love the classic rock music which fills most modern movies , there is no question in my mind that this music is simply and clearly more memorable , more delightful , better constructed . the stars in this movie are more talented than the stars i see in the movie theaters today . and jeanette macdonald , without the benefit of beverly hills plastic surgeons , was more beautiful than the stars i see today . i am unclear as to why so many other posters are apologetic about liking this movie and more generally this group of movies . they say it is dated and try to explain why it is the way it is . and those that do not like it say that it is not very good but compared to what ? i think this movie will doubtless still be entertaining people when so many other movie are long forgotten . there is just too much quality in every way in this movie for it not to be remembered and enjoyed . i recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates great talent , great beauty and great music .
when i saw birthday girl i liked it so much i set out to see every nicole kidman film i could , only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it . i theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control , with nicole kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment -- imho . thus for instance , dogville , even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home , or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else 's attention , or other pet causes of kidman 's . here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job . i do n't how or who was able to restrain her , but apparently it worked . the way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman . and consequently , what makes a man 's most desperate hopes marginally attainable . of course , the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy , but his transformation is adequately believable . it is n't coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego . instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances . also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human , apart from their criminal mission . her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to american culture . and while they are his adversaries , they are never really his enemy . in effect , they teach him to be compete . i really marveled at kidman 's ability to physically appear russian . it had me wondering whether her ancestry was russian , but none of the photos of her i examined showed any hint of it . maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing . i can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film . despite my gratuitous digs at ms. kidman , the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime .
i 've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond . you 're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group n.w.a . which dates back to the beginning in 1988 , in 1989 ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in 1991 , the band breaking up when dr.dre left . which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was somewhat based on that . further more this movie was a 90 minute laughing spree , the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious . not to mention the `` love song '' tasty was hooking up . and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked , just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they 're managers getting shot every time too . people who did n't enjoy this movie probably did n't get it or were complete idiots , my opinion
this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy , for a variety of reasons . however it emerges at the end of the day a winner , despite all its flaws . it 's still a very good film , even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments . one problem here is the look of the film , which is n't very consistent with the other 2 films . i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz . the first 2 films have that dirty , lived-in look with all the technology and so forth . in `` jedi '' on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned . this makes for a much less textured film . also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy . at this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself . another aspect is its lack of originality . where `` star wars '' created a whole new experience in cinema and `` empire '' brought us to alien worlds of swamps , ice , and clouds , `` jedi '' lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film . first we are back on the desert planet tatooine , and then we are watching them face another death star ( maybe the emperor could n't think of anything new ... but you 'd think lucas or kasdan could ) . also we have these ewoks , who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears , in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of `` star wars '' if they had n't run out of cash . it just feels like lazy construction . the most unfortunate aspect of `` jedi '' for me is the weak handling of the han solo character . whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time , trading one liners with the droids . instead of a real drama we 're stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke -- as if the conclusion of `` empire '' where she confessed her love of him had never happened . the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film 's central story after his rescue . ford , for his part , looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances . this is more like a 1990s ford performance , bored and looking `` above '' the film itself . fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes . lando , an interesting character introduced in `` empire '' , here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle . only hamill , given an interesting development in the luke character , is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character . probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work . and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters . really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package . ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor . the film would sink if he had been too far over the top ( as he was at times in the new films ) . visually and in terms of effects work , other than the `` clean '' look of everything it 's hard to find fault . jabba is a very effective animatronic character , one of the most elaborate ever constructed . the space battles towards the end are very impressive . ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears . but on its own , it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas ' later productions .
i first saw this movie 3 years ago , and it was introduced by then disney chief eisner and the real jim morris . about a month ago , it came back on tv , and this time i taped it . since then i must 've watched it at least three times . this is a wonderful , inspirational , feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned . it resists going for every sentimental trick in the book , as well as all of the other clichés . it is refreshing to see a movie where the kids are n't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues , and the jocks are n't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads . these are just normal people who have dreams like you and i . in my opinion , hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term `` gritty realism '' , making movies where everyone curses , and has problems with aggression . this movie is about a man who has a dream , and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream . the people in big lake tx seem so personable that i want to move there . as i said b4 , the film does n't try to go overboard with sentimentality . dennis quaid , as usual , never disappoints . i 've watched him from the late 70 's , and he is so underrated . but this movie has excellent performances from everyone concerned , and kudos to the writers . a gem in the movie is near the end when jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game , and his wife calls out to him from the stands . he rushes over and reaches out to his family . the look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless . if you 're looking for a change of pace , then pick this movie up .
1985 was a good year for films - maybe even great - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol ' oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members . 11 nominations and not a single title : such was the academy 's disdain for one of their greatest directors ; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler 's list , which is , arguably , not as good ( and i 'm half-polish ) . do n't get me wrong , schindler was a classic . and i 'm not knocking 'out of africa ' ( which won that year ) either ; but it was , in my mind , a class behind this one : an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and i 'm not a big cryer . maybe it was the music ( superb ) , or the cinematography ( sumptuous ) , but more likely simply the acting : whoopi , who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne ; danny glover , who i 'd never heard of before ; and , of course , oprah . the rest is history ; but , at the time : who knew ?
i was born in 1982 . most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late 80 's and 90 's . i watched the groove tube for the first time in 2001 , when i was 19 . and i found it hilarious . so for anybody who thinks that something `` dated '' ca n't be quite funny 30 years later .... think again ! it 's funny even if you have no idea what the 70 's were like , and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe . who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature ? there is plenty to laugh at . the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best .
scanners ii : the new order is just as good as david cronenberg 's classic scanners , scanners was made in 1980 and scanners ii in 1991 so their 's an eleven year gap between the two movies . the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing , it would n't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene that 's just has gruesome as the first . scanners ii : the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well . the plot to scanners ii : the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers he 's being used and decides to get revenge . scanners ii : the new order is a great sequel to david cronenberg 's sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen . check this out . 10/10
ralph and mumford , misfits in their own land , get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch . twice upon a time is the story of them , the characters they meet , and their struggle to set things right . with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business , this offbeat movie hits the mark . the animation process , while similar to that of the cut out `` south park '' style , is much smoother and far more three-dimensional . if i did n't know that the animation was this style , i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink . if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx , please do ! you wo n't really miss anything if you do n't , but if you do , you will get much more out of the experience !
i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was `` boring '' and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage . it was made in 1925 ! ! ! ! i think it absolutely incredible for it 's time ! the journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable . it took them a week just to cross a river . the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock , sometimes barefoot in the snow . i would like to see anybody do that now ! i thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story .
this wonderful 1983 bbc television production ( not a movie , as others have written here ) of the classic love story `` jane eyre '' , starring timothy dalton as rochester , and zelah clarke as jane , is the finest version that has been made to date , since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte bronte in both concept and dialogue . a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ; when film producers start to meddle with a classic 's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed . thankfully the producers of this `` jane eyre '' approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original , which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times , to enjoy its multi-layers of sweetness and delight and suspense . the performances are delightful , the music is just right , even the gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful , and set the right tone for the production . my only criticism , though slight , is that this version , like every other version ever made of jane eyre , ignores the christian influences that built jane 's character and influenced her moral choices . in today 's modern world a woman in jane 's situation would n't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her . `` oh , just get a divorce '' , she would say to her man , or she would live in sin with him . but jane eyre knew she could n't settle for this course in life and respect herself . why ? this decision was based on the foundations of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood , not from the brutal calvinist lowood institution , but from the christian example of a true friend , helen burns , who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek . someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation . a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing `` even so , come lord jesus ! '' should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it .
old movie buffs will know why i 'd call this one `` the man in the grey flannel robe . '' most bible-based movies are basically schlock- what might call forth smiles and giggles here is how peck , tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the spear carrying neanderthals all about him . as a great romance , it falls flat as unleavened bread . but there is something gripping about this movie . of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the ambivalent attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god . billy sunday 's thesis is duking it out with h.l . mencken 's antithesis all through the script . who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus-backed synthesis depends on your point of view . other than that , d & b boasts a good performances by peck ( especially in the closing repentance scene ) and by jayne meadows as his bitter first wife michol , vivid , moody atmosphere ( good idea to set most action at dawn or night ) , and the rousing rendition of the twenty-third psalm at the end .
well , when before i saw this film i really was n't sure whether it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong i was ! i thought that this was one of the best films i 've watched for a very long time , a real family classic . the story of a young evacuee and his new 'foster ' dad , this film ticks all the boxes . i 've not read the book ( maybe that 's a good thing & meant i enjoyed the film more ) but with regards to the story , i really ca n't think of any bad points , hence scoring it 10 out of 10 ( and i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks ! ) . by the time william proclaimed ' i can ride my bike , dad ! ' i was sobbing my heart out ( anyone who 's seen it will understand , i 'm sure ) . really heartwarming , and definitely recommended .
i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend , whom is a producer on the movie invited me . forget what you have seen in the commercials , forget what you have heard , go see this film for yourself . i was more than surprised by it . in a world of the grinch , charlies angels , the 6th day , unbreakable , here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks ! glorious scenes , wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart . i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason . robert deniro deserves an oscar nod . if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package , this would be the film .
this is the one in which the diminutive ruth gordon plays an agatha-christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe . gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation , while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york . he manages , however , to leave behind some clues , scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note . columbo enters the case , suspects her at once , and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers . oh , and mariette hartley is on hand as gordon 's secretary and would-be blackmailer . hartley is , i believe , the grand daughter of the psychologist b. f. skinner . i 'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button , which is on display during a belly dance sequence , but i 've always admired skinner anyway . the murder is well handled . it 's a good plot , and none of the performers or crew fluff anything . but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon , only a skosh over five feet tall . she was over 80 years old and looked it . there are moments when she almost teeters , but she consistently exudes charm . her acting is idiosyncratic . you can never be sure when she 's being serious or when she 's putting columbo and the audience on . she 's given some good lines too . what humor there is comes from gordon . columbo does n't have any of his frequent comic moments . all in all , a nice job by everyone concerned .
i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift , who was made into a monster by society . suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got . but it was a happy surprise . my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic ( the fact that the male lead is n't bad to look at surely helped ) , and there was enough plot development , action and even humor ( the fact that it takes them until the 3rd part of the movie to now each other 's name had the whole movietheatre laughing ) to keep you entertained and invested in the story . so in short : not what i expected , but a very good surprise indeed . i 'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd .
the season finale sent mix messages , i felt feelings of joy , and also feelings of being lied to and deceived . roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband , dan , had died . she also admits the family never won the lottery , and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be . i 'm still confused about when she said becky ended up with david , and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant . so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be , but it was n't . so the season finale was good , but sent mixed feelings . i will always be a fan of the show . : )
ok - i admit . i think kenny doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his good looks , the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable , but reasonable plot . starting out , we 're introduced to the three lead females of the movie . one a headmistress - very concerned about her image and never married . a police officer - with child and a bad ex to go on about . the third - a power & status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex 's . they are almost the `` first wives club '' , and indeed there is much verbal bashing of ex 's involved as well as some `` he left the credit card '' behaviour . characters set - the movie continues . mcdowell 's character , the headmistress , arrives late at a funeral - where a young organist , filling in for the regular player ( doughty ) catches her eye . what will her two friends say about the ensuing mischief ? will they live happily ever after ? a tissue or two recommended if you 're the teary type - the end uplifting , but maybe not what you 'd expect . all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action , special effects and schlock horror .
this movie reminded me that some old black & white movies are definitely worth the look . initially i had some reservations , however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated . i was very impressed with the mixture of drama , suspense & comedy . arthur askey ( tommy gander ) is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time . definitely add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and `` too '' powerful or overly `` funny '' movies of today .
paul verhoeven ( genius and master film maker ) strikes back with the less than perfect , yet still fun in a `` dirty old man type of way , '' hollow man . the first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints . yet i am giving a recommendation to this film for it 's mind blowing special effects ( perhaps the best so far around ) and two dandy performances by the leads . verhoeven 's moral questions are of course thought provoking , and although the film turned off many , this movie is pretty soft-core for old verhoeven . two major flaws : josh brolin ( aka walking ape-man ) and the whole deal with the elevator . if there was an access ladder , why were they trapped down in the lab ? a fun horror film for a saturday night .
* * * spoilers * * * * * * spoilers * * * released in 1956 , and considered quite racy at the time , douglas sirk 's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing . the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle , who is insecure , weak , wounded & very alcoholic , played by robert stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone . ms. malone 's performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes , which she uses to show us her emotions , which mostly consist of lust ( for rock hudson ) and jealousy ( for lauren bacall ) . malone is the only actress i 've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first . now do n't get me wrong , her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot , and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950 's . but it is also terrible , because as likeable and attractive as malone is , she 's not a very good actress , and she 's not capable of subtly or shading . her performace is of one note . she does get to do a wicked mambo , and in a great montage , as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a staircase , sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses . stack , ( who should have won an oscar ) & malone , ( who won the award , but should n't have ) are the real stars of the film , the ones who set all the hysteria , both sexual & otherwise in motion , while the `` real stars '' of the film , hudson & bacall fade to grey & brown , which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in . hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood & best friend of stack 's , and the stalked love interest of malone 's who moans & groans over rock through most of the film . but hudson wants no part of her , and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack . no one is very happy & no one is happy for very long . the stack-bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year , and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile , and ca n't give bacall a baby to prove that he 's a man . sirk who was a very intelligent man , and had a long & fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany , ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950 's with a series of intense vividly colored `` women 's movies '' or melodramas . although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material , in sirk 's hands they became masterpieces of the genre . sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations & lighting , make believe shadows , and lots of mirroed reflections . in `` written '' the characters are always peeking out of windows , listening at doors or sneaking around . so in the end , after much violence , an accidental murder , a miscarriage & more sirk ends the movie with a final & startling scene of a `` reborn '' and reformed malone in a man-tailored suit , sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell .
we taped this when it aired on tv back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release , for it quickly became one of our family favorites . the kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba-zillion times , yet they still watch it religiously with friends . it 's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups -- similar to `` grease . '' vanessa williams is spectacular . jason alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet . i 've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him , but our family gives him top ratings . ( we loved his 'giant step ' number . ) marc kudisch ( as conrad ) supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers . and brigitta dau ( as ursula ) just flat steals the show . probably our favorite character in the entire movie . the one disappointment was chynna philip 's performance of kim . part of that has to do with the writing . kim 's role is completely one-dimensional . complicating that , philip 's delivery is flat , unimaginative , unbelievable and just plain awful . the director should have seen that and corrected it . or never cast her to begin with . overall , though , the picture is delightful and i highly recommend it for families of all ages .
my take : a goofy , yet imaginative mess . keanu reeves ( yes ! that keanu reeves ) and alex winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy bill and ted 's excellent adventure , now a cult classic . in this sequel , bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time . they might as well travel heaven and hell too ! during the beginning of this sequel , bill and ted are preparing for a `` battle of the bands '' competition which may make them more famous than ever . meanwhile , many years in a futuristic civilization , the time-wizard from the first film ( the always watchable george carlin ) is running a university praising bill and ted 's names . there , an evil tyrant ( joss ackland , from the hunt for red october ) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock-stars once and for all . so he sends two identical android replicas ( in the words of bill and ted : robot us 's ) to do the dirty job . there after , bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell , with inhabitants that happens to include the duo 's worst memories , and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends ... and their show . along this whacked-out voyage , they play board games with none other than death ( william sadler , from die hard 2 ) , reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal , aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more . bogus journey 's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks are n't up to to-date standards , and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated ( to be honest , the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year , even for the 90 's ) . but with it 's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction , bill and ted 's bogus journey is fun , imaginative , and yes , bogus . rating : * * * 1/2 out of 5 .
this series , produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second world war , is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual 's presumption to criticize . the timing of world at war 's production in 1974 , amounting to some three decades after the events of the war , permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant . the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved , ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers , civilians , and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable . most approaching or well into their senior years , the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away , leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did . the information that these survivors give , strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part , give their stories all the more impact . such names as ira eaker , adolph galland , louis mountbatten , albert speer , gertrude junge ( hitler 's personal secretary ) ... the list is far too long to relate . today , within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition , are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to ww2 . the dvd series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools , that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price . i am almost done watching the 11 disk set , having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago . it has lost none of its poignancy to me , indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times . the highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation . i think the value of this series is beyond counting .
four prisoners share a single cell : the domineering transvestite , marcus ( clovis cornillac ) ; marcus 's idiot savant buddy , paquerette ( dimitri rataud ) , who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches , cockroaches , and his little sister ; lassalle ( philippe laudenbach ) , the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife ; and carrère ( gérald laroche ) , the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping . after a brick falls from the wall of the cell , the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s . is this journal the secret to their escape ? or is there something much more sinister behind it ? i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call ( 2008 ) , which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i 've ever seen . however , much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan 's awful script , because ( as i remember ) valette 's direction was n't the worst part about the film ( unless he chose to include the baby ) . anyway , maléfique was a good way to get my respect back . . . it 's a french film ( obviously something i like ) and it takes place in prison ( which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums ) . so that 's two points for him before the film even starts . luckily , valette had me once the film ended as well . maléfique is a rather deep , rather complex , rather compelling story of obsession and desperation . . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality . while it 's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense , the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening . the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i 've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore . final verdict : 8.5/10 . quite a bit of respect earned back by valette . note : paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake ( surprise surprise ) . it 's due out in 2009 . i 'm not sure why , to be honest , as this does n't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states . but , i 've been surprised before . vive la france ! -ap3-
i ca n't believe i am just now seeing this film -- i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated , and i avoided roots for the same reason -- just as i have yet to see schindler 's list -- i do n't want to be `` entertained '' by other peoples ' pain , not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be . so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being mistreated by whites . the black people were perfectly capable of raping their own daughters -- or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their `` husbands '' . it was painful to watch , but everyone redeemed himself in the end , and the acting was phenomenal ! i could n't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 ! and i adore whoopi to start with - she was amazing . i 'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple .
at the time , `` my left foot '' was the little movie that could . it was hugely popular , and everyone applauded the fact that such a small , independent film could make it all the way to the oscars . since then , movies like `` my left foot '' are a dime a dozen , so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about . it 's certainly a well made and competent film , but it 's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day-lewis , who immerses himself in the role of cristy brown , a man living with cerebral palsy . day-lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in `` rain man , '' and the academy followed suit by giving day-lewis the same honor . the only thing really separating this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that -- its budget . in every other way it 's just as formulaic as any standard product . that 's not to say it is n't a good movie , but it 's not a masterpiece . grade : a-
i love this movie . as a kid , this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch . sure , it is mild now , but back in the day , it was awesome . dentists are one thing so many people fear , so why not do a movie about a killer dentist ? it 's cheesy , it 's fun , sometimes it 's scary , but it is awesome . and i have always had a love for medical horror . and corbin bernsen plays dr. feinstone perfectly , no one could have done it better . and for a low budget horror film , the effects and such are quite good . and i also love the theme music , it goes well with the film . ken foree ( dawn of the dead ) is also in this one playing a nosy cop , and does a fine job . there is a fair amount of blood , and some really cool torture/death scenes . check this one out !
this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects . just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century . this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people , not white , black , etc . good movie with a good message .
the fact that this film was put out on dvd still formatted-to tv and with a fuzzy picture really annoyed a lot of film purists ...... and rightly so . this deserves a lot better treatment . the story is about a street performer who needs a son to pass on his craft ( the rules of the day ) and winds up with a little girl instead ( not the conventional way ) .... and the problems that ensue afterward . the old man had bought the kid at a slave auction and soon discovers the kid is not a boy , which he obviously thought was the case . the old man `` bianlian wang ( xu zhu ) is kind of funny-looking with a missing front tooth and an infectious grin . the little girl `` doggie '' ( zhou renying ) is a cutie . the rest of the story is how the two manage after that . i usually like a nice sentimental ending but this gets a bit carried away in the final 15 minutes . overall , it 's involving story complete with drama , suspense , humor and sadness . just do n't expect a good quality picture for the money you are spending on the dvd . until it comes out on widescreen , rent it .
the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive . it 's too much for my budget at the moment , or i would purchase it , because the film is a good example of film noir ... and i enjoy watching richard widmark , jean peters and thelma ritter . criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much . that 's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white , mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary , cinematography-wise . the story is the story here ( as opposed to visuals , actors , sound , sets , etc . ) as a pickpocket ( widmark ) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters ' purse . ( say that three times ! ) . everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie : widmark , the cops , the u.s. agents and the communists and , especially ritter as `` moe , '' an informant . she and widmark are the stars of this film . peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by `` falling in love '' with widmark on the first meeting even though he 's nasty to her . only in world of film ! ! too bad , because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it . this an average film noir which means good , but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35 . for that price , one could do a lot better in the film noir market .
helena bonham carter is the center of this movie . she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity . kenneth branagh was tolerable . the movie itself was good not exceptional . if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing .
this film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons . the co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments . robert ginty and fred williamson have a memorable scene together near the end , where williamson says to ginty , `` you sure do get around buddy boy ! '' . i did enjoy this film only for ginty and williamson , but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely . a film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so . it seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film , maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look . the one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent , so that tripled with fred williamson and robert ginty make for a film worth seeing .
i liked it ... just that ... i liked it , not like the animated series ... i love it ! ! ! . the fact that this make less appealing is that we all try to compare and not to appreciate , but this cartoon was awesome , but it really did n't like it that much . there 's too much people talking about bruce being so cold , but if this is around 5 years later , anybody in a crime-fighting gang would get this angry and darker attitude , so to me it is n't a flaw . batgirl was awesome she really fit there , as there is n't more dick grayson as a robin , batman needed a good teammate , not like the new robin , he is just a child and you cant rely that much on a child . but heres what did n't work : the new artwork ... it is n't horrible but ... to me it does'nt work in a series like batman . this is a dark character , with a maniac killer like the joker , so you cant put this kind of artwork in this cartoon , the joker is n't a bad design but i still like the past joker ( but to me the best joker ever was the one who appeared in batman beyond : return of the joker ) , so this joker is n't near as good . the good thing about the joker is that it still mark hamil voice . my favorite character : harley quinn ( im in love for her ) they put an awesome episode for her : mad love ( to me the best episode of this series ) . here we finally know how she turned harley quinn , and how the joker twisted her mind , and it feel that atmosphere that you feel in the animated series , darker , no happy ending , brutal fight with the joker ( but too short ) , this is how it was to be all the series . but in general i did n't like how she made harley in this series ... in almost every episode they put funny but in a ridiculous way , she get punched , she say nonsenses , she make flaws ... c'mon she is funny in a way you can laugh with her , not from her ... and here they put ridiculous ( like i said the only episode where i do n't think that its in mad love and beware of the creeper ) so in general its a good series , it has it upsides and downs , the drawn could be better ( my good ! ! ! kill that catwoman ! ! ! ! ) nice sound effects , nice music , nice voices and nice episodes : my favorites , mad love , jokers millions , old wounds , sins of the father , and cold comfort . if you enjoyed batman : tas you can watch this but do n't spec too much , in the other hand if you did n't watched tas , watch this first and then watch tas in that way you 're really gon na love tas : d
excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted , ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras . the film is much more than a commentary on globalization . in fact , it humanizes the workers in china , the owner of the factory , the bead distributor in new orleans , and even the revelers in new orleans . what stands out the most is the director 's ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way . his amazing access to the factory is another aspect that 's intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside . it 's a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it , and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated .
it starts slowly , showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april , but do n't give up on it . nothing much happens , but the time passes exquisitely , and there are numerous sly jokes ( my favorite is the carriage ride in the storm , which i find hilarious ) . the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word , the scenery is beautiful ( as is polly walker ) , and the resolutions in the movie are very satisfying . the movie takes a couple of liberties with the book , the biggest being with the arbuthnot/briggs/dester business , but i actually preferred the movie 's version of this ( it may be more sentimental , but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story , and anyway i like sentiment when it 's well done ) . an excellent movie , especially as a date movie during lousy weather .
twelve years ago , production stopped on the slasher flick `` hot blooded '' since almost everyone on the set started dying . now , a couple of film students have decided to finish the film , despite the fact that there 's a rumor that the film is cursed . well , they 're about to find out that some curses are real . when scream was released , every country seemed to want to cash in on its success , even australia . the concept , which today has been done to death ( a slasher film within a slasher film ) was at the time relatively cool and original . this movie was released right before urban legends : final cut and scream 3 ( well not in the us but in australia ) so it felt like the first movie with this concept . when urban legends 2 was released , most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie was n't even good , the movie flopped disastrously . now , cut is not the best slasher flick ever , and nor does it try to be . it knows that it 's a rip-off , and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of neve campbell in the starring role . but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story , they 've decided to rip-off some 80s slasher flicks like `` nightmare on elm street '' as well and surprisingly enough , this actually works . the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer ! and instead of trying to scare the audience to death , they 've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie . there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i was n't able to fully ignore , the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie . spoiler ahead ; i mean , they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene ? it makes no sense i tell you . end of spoilers . all in all , cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip-offs that never made it big . i 'm surprised that this one never got a sequel , but i guess it simply came out too late . suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares . cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it 's completely ludicrous .
highly enjoyable , very imaginative , and filmic fairytale all rolled into one , stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive , young , and beautiful . a kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young . these three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting , dazzling special effects , and some solid sentiment and humour as well . stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of claire danes as the star ( i could gaze at her for quite some time ) to michelle pfeiffer ( i could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer ) playing the horrible witch to robert deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection . charlie cox as the lead tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other . mark strong , jason flemyng , and ruppert everett plays their roles well in both life and death ( loved this whole thread as well ) . peter o'toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes ( nice feet ) . but the real power in the film is the novel by neil gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind . stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works .
i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day . it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies . this one , however , was nothing less then good . october sky tells the true story of homer hickam , a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist . he and his friends begin to build rockets . his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother . the story is well written . a bit too predictable maybe , but that 's ok cause it does n't focus too much on those parts of the story . it 's important part , but where this is obvious the inner action , the action between the characters is focused on . the story is good . it has some clichés , but that 's ok . it 's based on actual event 's so you kind of ca n't just drop out these clichés . the characters are really good . where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high . you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them . they are well written and believable . this is a good looking movie . the sets and the 50 's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit . this all sets the mood of the film very good . the acting is really good . jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam . as for the rest of the cast they are good too . all together this makes out a pretty strong cast . all in all i 'm glad i caught this movie . it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events . if i had known that when seeing it , it would probably just be even more interesting . october sky is a good and interesting movie . it 's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy . it 's kind of a feel-good movie . not bad at all !
spoilers in the words of jean-paul sartre , `` hell is other people '' . in `` the odd couple '' , jack lemmon and walter matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be . as felix ungar and oscar madison , lemmon and matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together . as the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other , the laughs come thick and fast , before felix departs , leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individual . jack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic , cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man . walter matthau in contrast to lemmon 's character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits . lemmon and matthau are magnificant in their selected parts , to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by neil simon , and simultaneously because they work well as a team . as two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles , although similar in relationships with ex-wives and children , these two , late , great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate . so great in fact , that the world screamed out so much for something similar , that two years before matthau 's death and three before lemmon 's , the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel . this idea , whilst following hollywood 's irritating obsession with sequels , might have worked to a certain degree , but at the same time , it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film . ultimately it 's not really possible to say anything else . with simon 's amazing script , filled with humour and laughter , the creators of this film were already onto a hit . the casting of jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix ungar and oscar madison though , is the most important part of this film . `` the odd couple '' , with it 's traditional soundtrack ( which even gained a tribute in `` the simpsons '' ) , it 's excellent script and it 's genius leading men , is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember .
hugh ( ed harris ) is a hotshot , bachelor senator determined to run for president . one day , however , he happens upon an old high school classmate named aggie . aggie ( diane keaton ) is an accomplished and award-winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit . hugh is smitten . he convinces aggie to become his fiancé . but , will aggie have to sacrifice her principles of honesty in the world of politics , where things are not always what they seem to be ? and , will she be able to withstand the rigors of a harsh media blitz ? this is , mostly , a nice romance for those who adore tales of affection . hugh and aggie are absolutely in love and their banter and conversation are a good view . however , although the movie tries to show the political life in its reality , it does n't completely succeed . nevermind . the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written . with these advantages and the handsome personages of keaton and harris , those who sit down to the film will find it to be good entertainment .
not only is this a great african-american classic comedy , but one of many great american cult classics.i have recently purchased the collection edition of rudy ray moore.if you love the old school karate movies and black comedies , this is for you ! they do n't make movies like these anymore . my entire family are movie buffs , so this site is an extreme help on solving many debates . i am deployed in iraq right now . this helps me to stay connected to world that i know in the states . thank you imdb.i recommend this site to all my friends . dolemite rules ! do n't just take my word for it , check them out for yourself . ten lines is a lot for commenting on one movie i think , but if it gets the point across , i 'm all for it !
i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling doubtful about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels : well , this transposition is simply accurate , intelligent , delicate , careful , tactful , respectful , intense , in a word , perfect ! `` emma '' is one of austen 's most delightful and funny novels , thanks to overall irony pervading situations and characters . the movie respected this subtle irony , not disregarding the comic element ( miss bates above all ) . what engaged me in the novel , and the movie renders it clearly , is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist , and the modern look with which women , men , and their relation are handled , and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century , who lived almost a secluded life , could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did : that most and still fascinates me . we can feel this modernity throughout the movie : just replace costumes , and use a more current language but the situations , the feelings , the ideas would be extremely modern . i think of the morbid interest in other people 's lives , or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women 's relations , and still the difficulty in revealing , and giving expression to one 's feelings , especially love : every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value . the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances : a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role ( nowadays she would be probably too mature for it ) , toni colette is simply great . and how i envied them for the wonderful dresses they could wear ! and then , the breathtaking english countryside , where every situation gets such a magic and dream-like dimension ... a really enjoyable and deserving movie .
star pickford and director tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor , isolated scottish islanders -- the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success . visions of wind and wave , sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story , they are the story of struggle against hardship . the actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan , wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness , here with her father 's bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church , there seated with her guest 's walking stick in her hand like a scepter , discussing her lover , played by matt moore . see if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble . i tried , but failed .
after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy , bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler : diva las vegas , a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas . midler , who has been performing live on stage since the 1970 's , proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business . from her opening number , her classic `` friends '' , where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud , bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called `` i look good '' she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections . the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage ( even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it , but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical ) . bette also treats us to `` rose 's turn '' from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club . she brings the house down near the end with `` stay with me , baby '' from the rose and her only # 1 hit record , `` wind beneath my wings '' from beaches . it 's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans , it 's a must .
this could be difficult to for some people to get into , being used to hollywood production styles . the directing is uninspired , apparently simply a filming of the stage set-up , and the audio quality is bad here and there ( the rustling of people 's clothes occasionally competes with their voices , etc. ) . my friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect , and the first scene almost put us off . it seemed very stagy and cheesy . then we picked up on the tone of the content , and really started to enjoy ourselves . it is very funny , despite some corniness . definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog . also , helena bonham carter is adorable , of course .
there have been many film and tv productions of jane eyre each with aspects to recommend them , but i suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now . it 's just a classic ( and offers much more of the story than others do ) . timothy dalton is utterly in his element as rochester , rarely missing the mark ; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many-colored , while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character . zelah clarke 's jane is more cerebral than otherworldly , but she makes a perfect foil for dalton ( who , appropriately , towers over her ! ) the nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing ( once you 've absorbed the shock of dalton 's charisma ) . there are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better ; though this pretty much was a top-of-the-line production by the bbc 's standards of that time . but , it 's the performances that are the real pleasure . do n't miss this one !
police story brought hong kong movies to modern day cinema . jackie plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys , and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend selina ( brigitte lin ) . the movie features plenty of stunts , not only from jackie , but also from other actors ( who are now in jackies stunt club ) . three of jackie 's stunt members went to hospital during filming on the film . the movie also have some incredible fights scenes like `` the car park fight '' and `` the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of jackie 's finest . the movie also won award for best movie and best action design by jackie chan at hong kong film awards . everyone who loves jackie chan and/or martial art movies shud see this
this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family . when leo , the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the aids virus , announces it to his parents , they just ca n't believe it . the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject . the director , christophe honore , has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen . nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter . the news has a devastating effect on marcel , the young brother who hears about what leo has contracted , in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality . yaniss lespart and pierre mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers .
in 1933 dick powell and ruby keeler sang and danced their way through three warner brother musicals that offered depression era audiences a momentary distraction from their woes . gold diggers of 1933 , 42nd street and footlight parade were all set in the world of broadway theatre with basically the same theme of the show must go on . in addition to keeler and powell the films featured the kaleidiscopic choreography of busby berkeley , show stopping tunes and many of the same supporting players . all are arguably classics of their genre but i must admit a clear preference for footlight due to it 's pace energy and lead james cagney . warren william in gold diggers and warner baxter in 42nd street acquit themselves admirably as the shows production heads- particularly baxter as the burned out julian marsh in search of one last box office smash . both lack the infectious energy of cagney however , who perfectly compliments the frenetic pace of putting on a broadway musical . he is an absolute whirlwind as he deals with production numbers , unscrupulous partners and a gold digging girlfriend . of course cagney alone does not make footlight the classic that it is . the script crackles with some sharp double entendres delivered by a superlative supporting cast featuring frank mchugh , hugh herbert , guy kibbee and especially joan blondell who cuts everyone down to size . busby berkeley 's dance numbers are surreal , suggestive and risqué and done just in the nick of time before the arrival of the hollywood code in 34 . sadly , the thirties and sometime beyond would never see such a richly made musical with the verve and sass of footlight again . gentility and morality made sure of it .
this film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients , but somewhere along the way they did n't quite come together . i do n't know who made it , but it has a slightly disney-esque feel . while parts of it are improbable ( like when a pre-teen runs for a public office ) and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously , there is a healthy dose of normalcy ( whatever that is ) to keep things balanced and in perspective . the acting is alright . strangely , the relationship between frankie and her grandmother is convincing , but the relationship between hazel and frankie is a bit ... off . it 's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend , her grandmother , and her two passions : ballet and baseball . being a baseball player myself , it was quite painful to watch frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys , but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces . i read somewhere that she is n't really ballerina , but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful . overall , it was a good film about honesty and ambition , but its star mischa barton did n't quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in `` lawn dogs '' , `` lost and delirious '' , and her small but shocking performance opposite haley joel osment in `` the 6th sense . ''
i really liked this movie ... it was cute . i enjoyed it , but if you did n't , that is your fault . emma roberts played a good nancy drew , even though she is n't quite like the books . the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times , but she looks good on them . to me , the rich girls did n't have outfits that made them look rich . i mean , it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together . all of the outfits were tacky , especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits . i do not want to make the movie look bad , because it definitely was n't ! just go to the theater and watch it ! ! ! you will enjoy it !
' i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain . ' this is an excell film . it should have been re-rated to pg-13 . but anyways , prince 's first film and greatest . the follow-up sucked . but i have n't seen for years so here 's what i can remember about it . the kid ( prince ) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life , apollonia ( herself ) , keeping his band together ( the revolution as themselves ) and the tension in his family . but his rival band ( the time as themselves ) is ruining his life . like morris ( himself ) is trying to steal apollonia from the kid . just like saturday night fever , flashdance and 8 mile . really good . rent it , laugh and cry and if you luv it , buy it .
this film , which is based on a true story , comes from first time director and long time actor , denzel washington . denzel washington has given us some of the best performances of the last decade , as a black soldier in the civil war in glory , and a lawyer in the acclaimed philadelphia . and of course , he made special notoriety last year when he won the academy award for best actor in training day , in which denzel washington became the first african american to receive the award for best actor . i guess denzel wanted a change of pace , so he chose to direct antwone fisher , in which he also stars . fisher is played by derek luke , who is new to the silver screen , but has made some guest appearances on such television shows as king of queens , and he will be appearing in the upcoming film release of biker boyz . this is a truly well done film from denzel washington , considering it was his first time directing . undoubtedly , denzel felt some kind of commitment and believed in the real life story of antwone fisher . antwone fisher is about a young african american man in the navy who constantly gets into fights , and after one particular brawl he is sent to see a navy psychiatrist named jerome davenport , played by denzel washington . davenport helps antwone to deal with his troubled past and learn to move on with his life , by finding his birth mother who had to give him up at birth because she was in prison . what makes this film good is the fact that it 's not overly melodramatic . i was expecting something a little more like good will hunting , with a lot of swearing , fighting and vulgarity . not that i did n't like good will hunting , or the swearing , fighting and vulgarity of the film were out of place . quite the contrary ! however , antwone fisher is a true story , and i do n't think that washington wanted to sensationalize the story for dramatic affect in the film . do n't get me wrong , there are moments when we see antwone fighting , carrying on and having moments when it seems like the world is closing in on him . after all , in his first session with his psychiatrist , the character played by washington , devenport asks fisher where he was born , and fisher 's response is , ` from under a rock , ' an obvious jab at the pressures waning on antwone fisher 's soul . but i had to appreciate the fact that this film was n't sensationalized for dramatic affect . i think it shows real character on the part of denzel washington to deliver a more realistic story and to avoid the typical clichés that are common in hollywood films , even those based on true stories . one other point that i would like to bring up about antwone fisher is the acting . over all , performances were good in the film , but not great . at times , i think it was a bit obvious that the main characters were actors , but overall , to complain about performances in this film would be ludicrous . one actress that i would like to point out in this film is viola davis . she plays antwone 's mother , but she says barely two sentences in the movie at all , but not so much because she appears at the end of the film , but more because she in shock that her long lost son , antwone has found her . what i would like to point out about her as an actress in the lack of use of her . she in basically a character actress , and i have n't seen her play any really elaborate roles . she made appearances in traffic , out of sight , kate & leopold , and two recent films : far from heaven and solaris . in steven soderberg 's remake of solaris , she played a scientist on a doomed space craft orbiting a planet . in that film , she is confronted by george clooney 's character and she drawn to tears by what clooney tells her in a particular scene . when i first saw solaris , i remember seeing her tear up in the scene and thinking , wow , this woman can act . it was as if you could feel the character 's grief . in that brief shot of her face , she gave so much expression and i honestly felt very sorry for her character 's sadness and trouble in the film . i think she has definite potential as an actress and should be used more often perhaps in leading roles , rather than just as a character driven actress . nonetheless , antwone fisher is a very good movie . denzel washington , as always , pulls off a great performance and he gives us a great directorial debut . also , derek luke is a very talented actor . i think that antwone fisher will bring his immense critical fame for his portrayal of the troubled man , but i think that his public popularity will increase with the release of biker boyz , which also stars lawrence fishburn . antwone fisher is based on the book ` finding fish : a memoir , ' by antwone quenton fisher . * * *
it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched , beguiling , disgusting and repulsive , but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation . crispin glover , in all of his `` out there '' antics and predispositions , truly made something that is unique . in a world that has become starkly partisan , this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone . right off the bat , the film takes on a rather distant paradigm ( if there really is a model at all ) and initially shapes it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy . it 's rather shocking stuff , but if you had the opportunity for the q & a sessions after the screenings , it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator . in either guise , you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause . it will never be accepted , not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition . you may not like it , but it is certainly something worth watching .
a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings . the ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting , even though they are marrying other people . maybe a little trite in that the `` partners '' are both type a personalities , while our protagonists are much more relaxed . not anything heavy , but it made me smile . and hey for the guys - sell the natasha henstridge angle , and the gals - sell them the sappy romance , everyone wins !
andie macdowell 's facial expressions are great again in this movie . when you enter 40 and have been single for a while ( or all your life ) you may feel you are wasting away . the movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active . i liked the quick sexual encounter , which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher ( macdowell ) . her ex-student is cute enough , still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long . there are some parts that i thought rather unrealistic or unpractical , though . for example , at a scene where the other women 's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make andie macdowell dump the young man , would a mature police officer ( the other friend of macdowell ) allow her friend to do such a sinister act ? is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car ? of course accidents happen all the time , but i hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with ( that was the hardest part to believe ! ! for such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long ? ? ) ... maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long . beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public , especially to jealousy women over 40 , who are waiting some miracles to happen . the sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet , but if the man continued to live , would that last ? for how long ? nobody knows . nonetheless , it 's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later .... a year later maybe .
i 've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning ( while waiting for my laundry -- - how ironic ! ) mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin frankel 's title music again . i ended up sitting through about the first half hour , entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction , writing , and performances are . the movie is like a who 's who of 50s british character stars : cecil parker , michael gough , miles malleson , duncan lamont , and particularly ernest thesiger , great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills . not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood , not character players as such but charming , charismatic leads . this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well . an all-time classic , and i hope no one ever tries to remake it !
just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty could n't go anywhere , we are given a treat , a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by emily blunt , a marvel in the leading role , paul bettany , rupert friend , miranda richardson , and mark strong , as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of england 's most powerful monarchs . `` the young victoria '' dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power . emily plays the queen , with a good combination of raw strength and innocence , someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand , but who possesses enough confidence to move forward . she is able to portray victoria , as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand . victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown , and even when she takes command of her new position , she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course , the right support . luckily for victoria , there is albert , a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate . there is amazing chemistry between the two performers , and there 's little doubt what the outcome will be , but there is the figure of bettany 's prime minister , a man who provides victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her . miranda richardson and mark strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl . every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development , but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by blunt , an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances . in here , she is given the breakout role of her career , a real life historical figure , who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time . she shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years . she also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes . `` the young victoria '' is not a royal epic portrayal of england 's ruling class . it is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them . in the end , the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction . in here , there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far , and there is of course , a good old fashioned love story .
excellent view of a mature woman , that is going to lose everything ( even the pruner has a mortgage ) . the way she gets involved into this special `` business '' , the innocence , and the true love that exists between the people of a little town , it 's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh , light and funny comedy . i could n't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore . i love european films , and with movies like this one , my opinion grows stronger . a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed , in this same genre , is waking ned devine . saving grace , a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself . you will love it .
this is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people , in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby . meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let 's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent . ( she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts . ) without giving anything away , all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .
i 've seen a slew of `` 80s rocker horrors '' over the years , from rubbish like `` terror on tour '' to ridiculously fun gems like `` slumber party massacre 2 . '' somehow i managed to keep putting this one off , which is strange because it 's probably the most popular and well received one . well , i finally caught up with it and it 's easily the best of this mostly awful ( but almost always endearing ! ) subgenre . the plot ( which was pretty much lifted in the film `` black roses '' ) concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie , whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music . he loves 80s metal , especially his idol sammi curr ( played by the late great tony fields . ) after sammi is killed , eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammi 's final recording . once eddie plays the record backwards , he discovers he 's a bit tougher , and bad things start happening to those who taunt him . is sammi 's music possessed ? `` trick or treat '' is well-made and a total hoot . the special effects are awesome , even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams . i grew up in the 80s , and while i was n't a fan of heavy metal , i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping . haha ! i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan , so it 's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti-rock priest . if only i had seen this film as a kid ! while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal , the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way . this is movie 's weakest point , but if you can overlook that , it 's loads of fun .
i do n't think a movie like this would be released today . it takes it 's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is n't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat . but , what this film does have : an interesting study in how families ' deal with grief . how when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute , and we rely on raw emotions instead . grief without reason and patience is anger , even hate . and unfortunately , the lead character ( a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting ) in the film is given more than his fair share of it . he eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather ( wilford brimley ) who makes it clear to him that it was an accident . i got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart , but needed to hear those words from his parents , and to receive their forgiveness . what i loved about this film : the lack of dialog . there was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction , facial expressions . and the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors . something we do n't get to do alot of with today 's films .
`` magic '' is n't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves . you find yourself relaxing , and seeing others in a more benevolent light ... any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention . seldom are we soaked in beauty like this . as if that were n't enough , it 's funny . performances are , without exception , extraordinary , but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson , and the superb josie walker - both open like roses . why is n't this film on dvd ? it deserves to live forever .
i watched it some years ago . i remembered it as very mysterious situations , and a mixture of melancholic things , like the fate of dorothy and the personal future of bogdanovich . i turn to watch on my vhs copy and then i was reviewing it more and more . nowadays i am waiting for the dvd version , at any price , please ! the country and easy listening music is very well chosen from the very first second , a bit of blueish , but also happy . all the characters are great to me , with funny situations , great acting and a lot of dialogs that have turn this as a cult movie to me and a lot of people i met on the internet or cinema clubs . this may not be casualty . i think that the title is a hope about life ! you have to be happy and laugh as much as possible i know that this may be a particular comment for the movie , but the fact is that i like it very much , i think that movie marked me and i will never forget it .
after all the crap that hollywood ( and the indies ) have churned out , we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments . there are some clichéd moments , but i 'm not sure it 's possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie . there 's not much new here ... it 's just done well . make sure and pay attention , as the `` subtle '' scares come quickly and often . this is not a movie to watch while you 're eating pizza . there 's one very well-written red herring in this movie and , unfortunately , one very poorly-cast role . cheri christian just does n't make an effective julie ( the wife/mother ) . for one thing , she 's totally unsympathetic . i know , i know ... she 's just gone through a traumatic experience . but the viewer never gets to know her as she `` normally '' is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting ( in an unintentional way ) . i think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her , but i never did . finally , a thumbs-up for the ending , which is both disturbing and satisfying . it could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits , but the director wisely resisted . this is not a masterpiece by any means , but it is a good , old-fashioned scary movie ... something that 's rather rare nowadays .
i have very fond memories of this film , as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and i was eight years old . apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten ( the pan-and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it 's ambitious panavision compositions is now out-of -print . ) the film is very stylized ( shades of yellow submarine ) and admittedly uneven . some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished . the sad discarded blue camel ( shades of eeyore ) and his blue song are truly heartwarming . joe raposo 's songs are for the most part simply beautiful . definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably ( sadly ) fall into total obscurity .
never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning poland and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi occupation of the local towns just like many other european cities for example : norway . the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates . alexander knox , ( wilhelm gimm ) '' gorky park '' returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town . he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either . as the hitler party grew to power wilhelm grimm desired to become a nazi in order to return and punish this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind . marsha hunt , ( marja pacierkowski ) , '' chloe 's prayer '' , played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was romantically involved with whilhelm gimm . there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people 's families and their entire lives . the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas chambers . if you have not seen this film , and like this subject matter , give it some of your time ; this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly .
across the country and especially in the political landscape , people with any kind of political ambition , should take time out to see this film . the movie is called `` city hall `` and with little imagination , its synopsis can take place anywhere in america . it just so happens to open in new york . here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas ( al pacino ) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort . his right-hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun ( john cusack ) an equally bright individual who 's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office . everything points in that direction , until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan ( bridget fonda ) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor . a six year old boy and a police officer 's death are blamed on a career criminal who 's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo , corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern . ( martin landau ) and mafia bosses like paul zapatti ( anthony franciosa ) who are deeply involved . also implicated , are party officials like larry schwartz ( richard schiff ) who works for the probation office of new york . but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting . a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic . * * * *
everyone is either loving or hating this film . i am going with loving . it is so well shot and so well acted . beautiful . this film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making . if you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this . but if you like the tops of acting , photography , story and development , look no further then here .
dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern israel . for anyone who 's ever been in love , the film brings back the uncertainties , the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet . the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling . instantly , you are drawn in to dan 's plight , and you ca n't fail to be deeply moved . you ca n't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of dan 's desperate , snatched relationship with iris , and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable . if you have an ounce of passion , and have ever been in love , see this film .
personally , i enjoyed cut thouroughly . it was the first time i 've seen a theatrically release australian slasher flick . a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films . with all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that was n't a rip off of anything . i did n't even think it was really a spoof of other movies . it was a supernaturally theme horror like nightmare on elm street , not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief . i think it 's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres . cut was original , scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun . i 'd give it seven out of ten and would n't treat it as anything serious . it did what i expected it to do , entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying . i enjoyed it .
`` the brak show `` is good .probably not in the same level than `` aqua teen hunger `` or `` space ghost coast to coast `` , but definitely it have many brilliant moments .basically it follows the life of zorak and brak that have normal lives and go to the school , living in a neighborhood on the style of the 50 'sitcoms . the humor and the animation of this show it 's very much as `` aqua teen hunger `` ( and in one episode you could see meatwad ) with bizarre situations and strange characters .but it is good , it have funny parts . some of the songs are great , others not very much but i like this show . the funniest character is the father of brak . ( that is a human , nobody knows why )
this is best comedy i ever seen ! but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie ! : ) overall one of best film i ever seen ......... vachtangi ( benjamin ) and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili ( father germogel ) is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films : ) ) in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia , sergo zakariadze , sofiko chiaureli , verikoan djafaridze , sesilia takaishvili , dodo abashidze .... they all are stars in georgian cinematography : ) plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best ...... i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
first off , i dislike almost all neil simon movies . but there is something about this that is unique , that draws me in , and i would say it is among the most entertaining comedies i have seen . the second time i watched it , the connection was clear . when did neil simon meet my grandmothers ? ah , afraid they might sue , so he changed them into men . and how dull would it be if they were only housewives , show biz stars is more fun . well this is a personal review , and my still living grandmother at age 97 ( she even outlived walter matthau 's magnificent impersonation of her ! ) would deny it -- but some of you must find resonance in these characters . secondly , i have little tolerance for george burns , but somehow he turned in one of the finest supporting performances i can recall ( and my late grandmother even enjoyed it , although failing to recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the film character ) . very ethnic in flavor , and over the top , you will either laugh and laugh or turn this off . for me , the pleasure lingers .
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler . when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street , especially the character eloise who 's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle , like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star . this film , like most race films , keeps people watching because of the great entertainment . race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era . the dancing styles , the music , dressing styles , you 'll love it . this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood , it would of had better scenery , better filming , and more money which would make any movie better . but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has . i have to say out of all micheaux 's films , swing is the best ! the movie features singers , dancers , actresses , and actors who were popular but forgotten today . doli armena , a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky . the sexy , hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame . adding further info ... popular blues singer of the 20 's and 30 's cora green is the focus of the film , she 's mandy , a good , hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women . a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive , curvy woman by the name of eloise ( played hazel diaz , a hot-cha entertainer in the 30 's ) and a fight breaks out . then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle . lena provides mandy with a home , a job , and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith ( played by hazel , i guess she 's playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name ) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior . when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg , lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy . tall , long , lanky , but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well . pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him , he might shape up . there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith ( hazel diaz ) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that 's not enough , she almost gets into a fight with mandy again . in between there 's great entertainment by chorus girls , tap dancers , shake dancers , swing music , and blues singing . there 's even white people watching the entertainment , i wonder where micheaux found them , there 's even a scene where there 's blacks and whites sitting together at the club , micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films , he should be commended for such a bold move . this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux . this movie is one of the best of the race film genre , its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business . no these early race films may not be the best , ca n't be compared with hallelujah , green pastures , stormy weather , cabin in the sky , carmen jones , or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person 's eyes . these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life , be beautiful , classy , and elegant , and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood . most of the actors and actresses of these race films were n't the best , but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time , micheaux and spencer williams could n't afford nina mae mckinney , josephine baker , ethel waters , fredi washington , paul robeson , rex ingram , and more of the bigger stars , so micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies , some were good , some were n't great actors and actresses , but i think micheaux and others knew most were n't good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent , they just wanted their stories told , and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films . for some true actors/actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work , especially if they did n't want to play hollywood stereotypes , so i think you 'll be able to spot the true actors/actresses from the nightclub performers . these race films are very historic , they could have been lost forever , many are lost , maybe race films are n't the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films did n't start out great in the beginning . i think if the race film genre continued , it would have better . if your looking for great acting , most race films are n't the ones , but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films , than watch race films . there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast , moon over harlem , body and soul , paradise in harlem , keep punching , sunday sinners , dark manhattan , broken strings , boy ! what a girl , mystery in swing , miracle in harlem , and sepia cinderella , that not only has good entertainment but good acting .
mr michael jackson is an artistic phenomenon . his short movies , i.e . music videos , are simply the best . i do not care if i get a sane sci-fi feature from this man , but i do care to get a medley of his crazy dancing , shriek yells , cool crowd choreography , and some bits of cgi and animation . there also should be a few uninterrupted videos . everything i 've mentioned is here . stupid plot and over-the-top `` vanity fair '' are not a problem when i witness mr michael jackson in action . to me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos ( not `` king of pop '' which sounds moronic , especially for us , russians , because `` pop '' sounds like the russian word for `` arses '' and mj is definitely not `` king of arses '' ) . i can re-watch his best music videos ( which are artistically beautiful ) and i never get tired of them . my first impression of this film was `` what is this ... ? '' ( bits of different videos , some drawn images , unsettling jumps from one theme to another , absence of any cohesive plot line , some kids fooling around , etc . ) but as i watched it till the end , i could tell that it was great and really nothing like anything else shown on tv nowadays . what i like here too is that it never shows any shameful material and can be watched by kids easily . without mr michael jackson the universe of music videos would be rather poor . even the best classic videos of other artists can not come very close to the energetic hyperbole of mj musical insanity and artistic quality . he knew how to get the audience of different ages and he knew how to remain a man with moral principles . when i see a proper dvd release with mr michael jackson videos i know that it deserves to be purchased even if some clips have already appeared in some other previous release . `` history i '' , `` history ii '' , and `` moonwalker '' are all great , though only `` moonwalker '' is more like one movie ( with a solid `` smooth criminal '' theme , `` paparazzi '' topic , and a few weird spoofs and twists ) . being no fan of mj i can still give this `` film ... like no other '' a solid 9 out of 10 ( i 've been hit by `` smooth criminal '' for sure and my major complains are the following : initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main `` mj anti-drug campaign '' should have been given more `` sky-rocketing insanity and stress '' and there should have been more `` moonwalking '' itself of course ) . thanks for attention .
john carpenter 's halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece . it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers , who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters . this was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise . carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters ; unusual for a horror picture . even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore , and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date . get that ! halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance 's career . a true classic .
although i did n't like stanley & iris tremendously as a film , i did admire the acting . jane fonda and robert de niro are great in this movie . i have n't always been a fan of fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time . de niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold . he gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he ca n't care for him anymore that will break your heart . i would n't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment , but i will say you wo n't see much bette acting anywhere .
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era . i loved the visuals -- very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel . i thought tom hanks was really great in this , he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work ( which he did n't fully choose for himself ) but still wants to have a normal life for his family . he does the best he can to see that happen . do n't want to spoil the plot -- but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format . ( it is violent though . )
this was truly a great movie . i loved dennis quaid and the entire baseball team . jay hernandez is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch . the chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular , it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds unite as one with one goal . this team came back from the brink , having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything . i love movies like this as they really are very inspirational . on top of that , dennis quaid 's character getting a place in the major leagues . you ca n't do anything , but root for this guy . it just seems like when someone is supposed to do something , they are going to do that . things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click . based on a true story , this film will really make you think about the fact that `` nothing is impossible . ''
this movie has so many wonderful elements to it ! the debut performance of reese witherspoon is , of course , marvelous , but so too is her chemistry with jason london . the score is remarkable , breezy and pure . james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold . he also seems to have a knack for lost-days-of-youth movies , be sure to catch his score for the recent `` peter pan '' and the haunting gothic music of `` the village . '' i first saw this film at about 13 or 14 and now i do n't just cry at the ending , i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia . show this movie to your daughters . it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film .
holes ( 2003 , dir andrew davis ) when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing , he is sent to 'camp green lake ' . at this camp , the warden , and her two henchman , mr. sir and dr. pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole . but for what reason ? stanley plans to find out . i never really had any intention in watching 'holes ' , and i must admit , i only really watched the film , because i 'm such a fan of shia labeouf , but even if you are not a fan of him , then it does n't matter .

jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school , but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain . he happens upon down-on-his-luck trickster eric tsang , who immediately sees cash potential in the youngster 's skills . basketball is the chosen avenue for riches , and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media . general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before . it 's all a bit shaolin soccer i guess , but not so quirky or ridiculous - the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions , and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up . you 've seen it all before , but it 's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it 's done well . luckily it really is done well here ( some might say 'surprisingly ' with chu yen-ping in the director 's chair ... i expect he had good 'assistants ' ) - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish . jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout , but such is his style , and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect . eric tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character that he 's played many times before ( in real life , for instance ) who gets many of the films most emotional moments . since the film revolves around basketball , it 's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing . the cast show some real skill , including chou , and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining ( assuming you like that sort of thing ) and justify the movie 's plot/existence . there 's only one significant fight scene in the movie , but it 's a doozy in the `` one against many '' style . jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves , and is quite impressive - he 's clearly pretty strong and fast for real , and ching siu-tung 's choreography makes him look like a real martial artist . i wish there 'd been more , but at least it 's a lengthy fight . very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer , and recommended viewing !
moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i 've seen . what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality , and the obstacles and guidances through life . the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it . whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life , these are what humans usually wish for . moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal , since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei . the meaning of the title 'moon child ' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people 's way , giving guidance . i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on . the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic . the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it . some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game . the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed . nevertheless , i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching . the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers . it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch .
if you played `` spider-man '' on the ps version , then you 've seen it all . to truly experience it you should get the dc version . simply put it 's a much graphically superior game ; the textures are sharp , levels are easy to navigate , and it has much better sound then it 's ps cousin . i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day . well , marvel : ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you 're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library . swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game . if you have a dreamcast , snag this up for cheap . the dc version is simply incredible .
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only , the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids . as a matter of fact , with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces , at least for continuity 's sake . speaking of ann sheridan , she is the one true shining light of this movie . to paraphrase a cliché , ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd ! another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan . unfortunately , this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background . for a better example of the sheridan-reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row .
i was bored one night and red eye was on and thought why not . red eye is one of the best movies in a long time . i mean i just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant . the story is new and different . the movie also has two great leads in the movie with rachel mcadams as lisa reisert and cillian murphy as jackson rippner . the acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie . the music is just excellent , it give you chills and can also make you feel relax . i just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring . red eye is just phenomenal . nothing more and nothing less . it 's a excellent thriller . overall , i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over again . if you like red eye , then i recommend elektra and cry wolf . i give red eye 9 out of 10 . great movie
like i said its a hidden surprise . it well written well acted and well cast . i liked everything in this movie . look its hollywood all right but the brighter side . angelina jolie is great in this and i 'm totally watching every movie with her in that i can get my hands on . well worth a look .
after seeing the movie last night i was left with a sense of the hopelessness faced by organisations trying to tackle the problem the film portrays . the scale of the prostitution seems so large that it 's hard to see how it can be defeated without major governmental changes in cambodia . anyway , on with the review . although it is a sombre movie with an uncomfortable central relationship this is a very compelling film , and i 'd even go so far as to say it was enjoyable . the film was well edited for the running time and the performance by thuy nguyen was excellent . i also felt ron livingston played a very difficult role well . it would have been nice to have a little more insight into why patrick feels he has to help holly , but maybe the reason is a simple as he explains to chris penn 's character . i wo n't explain it here - go see the movie . this is a good , thought-provoking film with obviously good intentions . i hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent sized audience and gain more support for the k-11 project .
in frank sinatra 's first three films , he was purely a speciality act : ostensibly playing himself , he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else 's movie . in his fourth film , the very enjoyable 'higher and higher ' , young blue eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role ... a task made easier because he 's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers . sinatra 's entrance is quite funny . michele morgan hears a knock at the door , and asks who 's there . from outside , a hoboken-toned voice answers 'frank sinatra ' . sure enough ... the opening credits of 'higher and higher ' may confuse some viewers , as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed . in fact , they only contributed one song to this musical : 'disgustingly rich ' , which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song , ' i 'm a debutante ' . interestingly , that rodgers & hart song -- one of their weakest -- is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie 's score ; several others are lively up-tempo numbers , notably 'it 's a most important affair ' , 'when it comes to love , you 're on your own ' and ' i saw you first ' . sinatra 's good in this movie , but he would do better work ( and sing better material ) elsewhere . the real merits of 'higher and higher ' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films . paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues : genuinely graceful ballroom dancers , they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material . ( here , grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul 's hands . ) grace hartman , who died of cancer at age 48 , did almost no film work , so it 's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up , to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid 's uniform . after grace hartman 's death , her husband had a long career as a character actor , just occasionally dancing solo . ( or alongside ken berry in one memorable episode of 'mayberry rfd ' . ) also quite attractive in a maid 's uniform here in 'higher and higher ' is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire . why did n't this talented girl make more movies ? perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton . i enjoy hutton 's performances but i like marcy mcguire even better . near the end of 'higher and higher ' there 's an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses , taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub . the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious ! regrettably , although leon errol plays a large role in 'higher and higher ' , he is given almost no comedy business : not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance . jack haley , despite his prominent billing , is also wasted . very well-represented here is dooley wilson , inevitably remembered as sam from 'casablanca ' . in that film , wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of 'as time goes by ' . ( in real life , wilson could n't play piano . ) here in 'higher and higher ' , he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players . less enjoyable is mel odious , i mean mel torme . victor borge gives a rare film performance here , handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows . the plot ? forget it . 'higher and higher ' is nobody 's idea of a 'great ' musical , but it 's an enjoyable delight , and i 'll rate it 8 out of 10 . director tim whelan , who worked in britain as well as in hollywood , deserves to be much better known .
`` most of us at least inhabit two worlds , the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the world within , the unconscious , a safe place where we can escape ... '' with those words , mr .gone introduces inside the world of `` the maxx '' a fascinating world where the fantasy and the reality are combined . inspired in the comic books of sam kieth , `` the maxx `` is very faithful to the material in what it was inspired , not only in the story but also in the graphic style , that look like the pages of the comic , giving this show a surreal and unique appearance . but also , the story it 's interesting and entertaining .at moments it could turn too weird , but when you got inside it , it 's hard to get out of it . the story and the characters are wonderfully developed . the music goes perfectly with the style of the show and give it the proper atmosphere . unfortunately , like many good animated shows , this one was short -lived . `` the maxx '' is a must see . it 's one of my all -time favorites .
the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart . the shortcomings of the film 's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan 's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages . historically this was in the late 8th century , when the centers of irish learning were over-run by the vikings . the vikings appear here as brute antagonists , the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east . the film 's narrative -- - which functions more as a parable -- - centers around the conflict between brendan , who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness , and his stern uncle the abbot -- who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen . the abbot disregards the value of brendan 's art in his quest for security . this is the movie 's outer conflict . brendan 's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells . this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros , who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without ( that 's as much of the story as i 'll divulge ! ) what i really like about this film is its creators ' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from 1200 years ago . the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells . ( particularly noteworthy is monk aidan 's pet cat , defined in few lines , yet purely -- - and even magically metamorphically feline . ) the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators . the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene , and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells . of course , historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict . however , by introducing archetypal elements into this story , the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived-life from that far-off time in ireland which feels psychologically true , however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact . ( the united nations ' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues ' club of artists in the secret of kells are n't historically probable , but they 're all well-designed , individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story . ) animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures . the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source , but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling ; if animation had existed in the dark ages , the secret of kells is what it would look like ! finally , brendan 's hero 's quest in this film is the artist 's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty , life and inspiration . ( without being preachy or even particularly christian , this movie affirms jesus ' dictum that `` man does not live by bread alone . '' ) in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky 's andrei rublev , a film about the great russian icon painter of the 15th century . the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist 's visual quest and creative process . it 's certainly not as profound as andrei rublev , but -- - heck -- - its a cartoon ! ( and one which will appeal to young and old alike . ) i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing : in its own modest life-affirming way , this stylized secret of kells is a classic .
carmen is one of the best films i 've ever seen . it 's hard to say whose performance is best : antonio gades , cristina hoyos and laura del sol are superb.they dance their souls out . it 's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth ; myth penetrates everyday life . dance becomes life and entire life is danced out . real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else , act out the parts of lovers of old . the magic is continuing .
in 2151 , in broken bow , oklahoma , a farmer shoots the klingon klaang with his plasma rifle after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the klingon is sent to the starfleet hospital . the vulcan ambassador soval proposes to unplug the life support system and bring the corpse of klaang to his warrior empire in planet kronos with honor . however , captain jonathan archer proposes to go with the enterprise in her first voyage and bring back klaang alive to his home planet . jonathan invites ensign hoshi sato and dr. phlox , who is treating klaang , to complete his crew , and the vulcan sub-commander t'pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of enterprise . when the equipment of the starship is shut-down , klaang is kidnapped by sulibans after a shooting in the hospital . after the autopsy of the suliban killed in the shooting , captain archer is informed by dr. phlox that the alien was actually a mutant , altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process . t'pol modifies the sensors of the enterprise to track the suliban spacecraft until she reaches planet riger x . they investigate and disclose that klaang was a courier , bringing an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leaders of the klingons in kronos . in spite of being a huge fan of star trek , i have not followed the episodes of `` enterprise '' on cable television . i have decided to buy the dvd box of the first season and this first episode surprised me . the adventure of the first enterprise , captain jonathan archer , the gorgeous t'pol , reed , mayweather , dr. phlox , hoshi and trip is excellent , at least in this pilot . i have noted in imdb that this episode is actually divides in two parts , but on dvd they are just one , therefore my review is valid for both . i did not like the music score theme , which i found very annoying , but this was an exception in this great show . my vote is nine . title ( brazil ) : `` broken bow ''
this film moved me beyond comprehension , it is and will remain my favourite film of all time , mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes . what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film , i have to put it into my dvd player , so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found , as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past 5 years . my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says `` but your own words ask for direct confrontation , is n't that a direct call for violence ? '' biko replies `` well you and i are in confrontation now , but i see no violence ! ! '' craig robertson fife , scotland
farewell friend aka adieu l'ami/honour among thieves is n't perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault , one to return stolen bonds , the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend . naturally things are n't quite that simple even after they open the vault , leading to some neat twists and turns . on the debit side , there 's a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park , bronson has a very irritating fonzie-like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments , brigitte fossey , sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s ( it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind ) , is something of a liability  her `` i 'll cook spaghetti ! i 'll learn to make love well ! i 'll read shakespeare ! '' speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways  and it 's a shame about the horrible last line/shot , but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that 's worth checking out if you can find a decent print . cinema club 's uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack , but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that 's no great problem , especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality .
kurt russell , whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world 's fair , will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter . there are times you feel that you 're watching elvis until something snaps you back to reality ... perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen ? all the performances here are excellent : season hubley as priscilla , pat hingle as the colonel , even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma presley . kurt 's dad bing is here playing elvis ' father vernon , and there 's a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis ' buddy and bodyguard red west . a must see for rock n roll fans .
i thought this movie was fantastic . it was hilarious . kinda reminded me of spinal tap . this is a must see for any fan of 70 's rock . ( i hope me and my friends are n't like that in twenty years ! ) bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit , stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together , but not succeeding well . if you love music , and were ever in a band , this movie is definitely for you . you wo n't regret seeing this movie . i know i do n't . even my family found it funny , and that 's saying something .
i 'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show . i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own , there 's lucy , bewitched , i dream of jeanie ( the one with barbara feldman ) , and then my mind goes kind of blank i can not think of any others , the women are all supporting roles not the lead . so for me , the jane show is in pretty good company . one thing i just thought of though . i 've watched several things made in canada , and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow ! it 's all made at the height of summer , lol ! granted it 's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think , they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that 's part of the lifestyle there also . i mean sctv , just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots . i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor , and i like the bald guy and his craziness , i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd ( i think ) another office comedy with a female lead . not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone , thats saying something . if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch . 7 of 10 .
i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting `` guess who '' game . the movie , however , needs more robin in it . he appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest . i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character , let alone knightwing . this movie just continues that bad tradition . the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which would n't be so bad in one movie if the romance was n't so unbelievable . it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it .
jane austen 's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen . kake beckinsale 's emma is irreproachable . gwyneth paltrow , ( with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography ) is able to bring out the comedy effectively , she fails to make emma likeable . paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong ' for the part ( and i believe the era ) and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses . kate beckinsale , on the other hand , manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly ( the most romantic of jane austen 's heroes ) actually sees in her . mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks , an appropriate age , chivalry , compassion and gentlemanly behaviour . emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful .
it is not as great a film as many people believe ( including my late aunt , who said it was her favorite movie ) . but due to the better sections of this film noir , particularly that justifiably famous `` fun house '' finale , the lady from shanghai has gained a position of importance beyond it 's actual worth as a key to the saga of orson welles ' failure to conquer hollywood . by 1946 welles ' position as a hollywood figure was mixed . citizen kane was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the hearst press and by hollywood insiders themselves . welles ' attempt at total control ( direction and production and acting ) of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system . his best job in this period was as edward rochester in jane eyre , supposedly shot by robert stevenson , but actually shot in large measure ( with stevenson 's blessing ) by welles . but the credit went to stevenson . only the stranger , a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing nazi war criminals , made a profit . for five years in hollywood it was barely a great record . welles returned to broadway in 1946 , hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of around the world in 80 days . but despite the assistance mike todd , and cole porter composing the score , the musical was a failure . his failure occurred just at the same time that his wife , rita hayworth , was on the rise with her portrayal of gilda . so the marriage was going on the rocks as well . welles had to make money - his broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy . he sold his interest in the possible movie rights to around the world to todd ( which he would eventually rue ) , and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of henri desire landru to charlie chaplin , who was supposed to be directed in it ( and who turned it into monsieur verdoux ) . the story goes that welles , with a $ 10,000.00 tax bill to worry about , called cohn and offered to do a film with rita for a down payment . cohn was willing to do so , but naturally asked what the film was . it was a wise question . welles was on a pay phone in new york in a pharmacy that had a book department . he grabbed a book with the title the lady from shanghai , and raved that it was a great thriller . somehow welles convinced the normally astute cohn that welles knew what he was talking about . cohn said he 'd look into getting the rights , and sent welles his down-payment of $ 10,000.00 . after cohn hung up welles bought the book and read it - and found it was really pretty bad . he spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up rita 's character of elsa bannister . certainly it has a curious plot development . michael o'hara is a seaman/longshoreman . he rescues elsa bannister , when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in san francisco . elsa is married to arthur bannister ( everett sloane ) a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation . she convinces him to hire michael as the skipper of their yacht . the cruise also contains bannister 's sinister partner george grisby ( glenn anders ) and one sidney broome ( ted de corsia ) who turns out to be a detective hired by bannister to watch elsa . when they can michael and elsa try to find time together , but broome or grisby keeps showing up . grisby makes michael an offer - he wants ( for reasons connected to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society ) to drop out of it , pretending to be dead . according to grisby ( the plot becomes murky here ) he can still collect his life insurance ( although dead ? ) and use it to run off to the south seas . he will pay michael $ 10,000.00 if he will pretend to shoot grisby . this includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder ( michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that grisby is probably dead ) . of course grisby is killed , and michael is arrested for that , and for the murder of broome ( shot with michael 's gun ) . michael is tried with bannister defending him , and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants michael to be convicted . michael is convinced that bannister is the actual murderer , and manages to escape just before the jury verdict . he is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival , and this leads to the famous `` fun house '' sequence and the conclusion of the film . it 's a terribly confusing movie ( as i have had commented on ) . that does not mean it 's not worth seeing - visually it is striking . witness the fight between michael and the police in the trial judge 's quarters , where he knocks the bailiff into the judge 's bookcase , shattering glass . or the clever use of photography to capture hayworth diving from a rock , reflected on the lecherous grisby 's binoculars . the acting is pretty good , in particular sloane ( possibly that fine actor 's best film role ) . glenn anders was a leading broadway performer . he rarely made movies before the lady from shanghai , and his slimy grisby is unforgettable . also ted de corsia does very nicely with broome - a detective who is really looking for his own interests , to his own cost . as for hayworth , she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before ( blood and sand , tales of manhattan , and the strawberry blond are exceptions ) , and is a memorable siren . welles ' o'hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe . it 's not kane , ambersoms , othello , touch of evil , or chimes at midnight , but it is a good film for all that .
this is the last dutch language film paul verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream hollywood films `` basic instinct , '' `` robocop , '' and `` total recall , '' among others . he sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet gerard reve , an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination . gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a literary club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from amsterdam . verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how gerard 's imagination twists reality . asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper `` and it says 'boom ' i read 'doom , ' when it says 'flood ' i read 'blood , ' when it says 'red ' i see 'dead . ' '' when he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it ; `` i lie the truth . '' he accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the club treasurer , a beautiful wealthy salon owner . as he gets to know her and learns her husband has died , he begins to imagine she is ' a black widow . ' is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess ? this is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory , i figured out is my favorite gender . looking at his body of work it is seems to be paul verhoeven 's too , and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality . it 's a nice change of pace from the usual hollywood fare . i saw it in 1983 and it is a film that `` stuck . ''
he-he-hello ! ! this is a really fun movie . basically , in party girl , you have your fun-lovin ' , independent , early 90 's new yorker chick . along with her party friends , she meets a mature turkish vendor . it is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do . it is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman . hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties . on a side note , parker posey makes this movie great . i have never been a great fan of her , but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies . there are subtle manerisms that perfected her character . if you want good laughs and a fun time , make sure to watch this movie . repeated viewings are a must .
talented detective mr. philo vance ( william powell ) cancels his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more , a rather deliciously complex murder ! as far as murder mystery films go , it just does n't get any better than this one . populated with suspicious characters , all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim archer coe , it 's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one 's head around it but boy , does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us . even the cops , the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful , fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one 's proceedings and amping up its overall `` fun '' factor . i particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner ( played by etienne girardot ) , who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one 's running time . also eugene palette 's detective sgt . heath provides welcome , often later delightfully humorous at his expense , critical commentary during vance 's investigation . i can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it has n't dated particularly well . does n't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though . watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one 's mystery . highly recommended you try !
the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy . many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker ( visually -- not story wise ) than what i expected . granted , this may not be the funniest movie ever made , especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that ( compared to others like something about mary or american pie ) . as you rewatch it , several jokes stand out and get funnier . if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie ( batman , x-men , etc . ) and liked them , you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie . if you did n't like them , you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those . if you did like this movie , the dvd has some cool extras .

panahi , whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim , has produced in his new offside a funny , obstreperous , joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he 's done . by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre-world cup bahrain-iran match in tehran stadium , panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent-mindedness , and the contradictions  and sheer absurdity  of the regime 's religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves . as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus , with a father pursing a lost daughter . this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint , but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what 's going to happen : she 's still easily spotted . the thing is , most of the men around do n't really care . still , rules are rules , and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would-be soccer girls , or some of them anyway , get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young , green , and rustic soldier-cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls ' independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose roar we constantly hear in the background  themselves . each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it . one wore a soldier 's uniform and got into the officers ' section . one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative ( she could pass for a pretty boy , and teasingly hints at that : `` are you a girl or a boy ? '' `` which would you like me to be ? '' ) . one does n't care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade . one ( aida sadeghi ) is an ardent soccer player herself  and so on . these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them ( safar samandar ) . one of the rural cops ( mohamad kheirabadi ) takes the girl soccer player to the men 's restroom ( of course there 's no ladies ' ) , forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask . a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes . later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department  violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice . a male gets mixed in with them  a kid who 's chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games . the van turns out not to be so spiffy : the radio aerial is broken . but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart-stopping reportage . cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now . there 's no score , the game goes to penalty kicks , and the winner will go to germany . in the background through all this is a real game , a real stadium , and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event . the excitement is tremendous , and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement . what makes this film so good , as may be clear by now , is that it 's shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around . this , in contrast to panahi 's previous highly calculated narrative trajectories , is spontaneous vérité film-making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling . the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro-islamic social prohibitions repressing women  the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit . how exactly do you reconcile the country 's ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval ? a lot of offisde is astonishingly real , including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything . the director 's decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega-event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary , polemic , and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick , and that ends in a way that 's brilliant and moving . i 've had reservations about panahi 's films before , but this one kicks ass . panahi does something remarkable here . he critiques his society , presents an unusual drama , and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation 's aspirations .
when this first came out , my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- it was so different from anything we had seen before . i was looking for a specific movie last night , and i found `` the mind 's eye '' again . the box is falling apart , and i am surprised that the tape still works ! although it is not 'finding nemo ' quality graphics , it is still very good . they should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery . highly recommended ! this is what it is : `` the mind 's eye '' is a spectacular odyssey through time . your journey begins at the dawn of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology . travel in the world of abstraction and on into the future with breathtaking computer animation imagery . `` the mind 's eye '' joins the imaginations of over 300 of the world 's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful , original music soundtrack . this unique collaboration takes you on an incredible voyage into `` the mind 's eye . ''
had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast , some really hard working people in the industry , and when i finally watched i was not disappointed . this movie has some altman-like flavor ( he 's mentioned in the end credits as a `` thanks '' person ) utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax . macy is pure , clean , and honest as a man who ca n't seem to escape his `` destiny '' , sutherland plays and portrays as few can , neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment , add tracy ullman , barbara bain ( remember mission impossible on tv ? ) , not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film . the script is uncluttered , the dialog is free from cliché and thoughtful ( especially between macy and david dorfman ) . suspend belief and enjoy , this is truly time well spent .
cassandra peterson originally created elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films , and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on the tonight show with johnny carson . she reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s , and the film elvira , mistress of the dark was the result . the plot is flyweight . television horror film hostess elvira dreams of success in las vegas . when her great aunt dies , she travels to new england in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show ; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house , a poodle , and an old book . it happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description , and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes . it also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on `` the old book . '' throw in a few teenagers , a stud muffin , and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go . no one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece , and it does drag now and then . but cassandra peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish : squirmy , sexy , and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy , she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes . from a flashdance disaster to witchcraft craziness , she is never less than wildly entertaining . it 's a tremendous amount of fun , and the film 's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense . will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day ? well , i do n't want to give anything away , so let 's just say you 'll have a lot of fun finding out . dvd quality is okay and there 's little in the way of bonus material , but if you 're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge . and if you 've never seen tassle-twirling , you 're in for a treat . recommended . gft , amazon reviewer
fairly good romantic comedy in which i do n't think i 've ever seen meg looking any cuter . all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp . of course , in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey , but that is why i love romantic comedies .... one can just totally forget reality and have a good time . nice film . damn , meg is a babe , eh ?
lee chang-dong 's exceptional `` secret sunshine '' is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year . it is an instantly sobering , brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought , yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes . through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small-town dynamics , lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism . `` secret sunshine '' remains an immensely compelling , fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime . its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations , remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness . adapted from a short story , lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life , last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent `` oasis '' . understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed , lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow 's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience . do-yeon jeon 's ( `` you are my sunshine '' ) best actress accolade at cannes in 2007 is well deserved . her performance as the widow shin-ae remains an unrelenting enigma . as a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control , the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film 's turbulent nature . with jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another , there 's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film , to its credit , never approaches . instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts . she becomes the centre of the film 's universe as well as ours . filmed in glorious hand-held cinemascope , the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from shin-ae through times of happiness , guilt and remorse . lee captures the details of life in the small , suspicious town of miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations , its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas . shin-ae 's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends , especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son , jun ( seon jung-yeop ) . the one recurring acquaintance is jong-chan ( song kang-ho ) , a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to miryang in the film 's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight . song has situated himself as a comedic anti-hero in south korea 's biggest films but his nuanced , low-key delivery here purports the director 's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary . if pain is ephemeral , then grief can never truly dissipate . and lee finds complexity in subsistence . when shin-ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak , she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical christianity as a foil to her sorrow . but lee knows better than that when he understands that religion , in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery , is never a simple solution . but lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others . the scenes in its latter half which deal with religion does n't allow itself to become aggressively scornful , which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters . lee 's first film since his call to office as his country 's minister of culture and tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering . in a film so artless and genuine , it arduously reveals that there 's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis , just the suppression and abatement of agony . `` secret sunshine '' leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence , and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith .
'shock corridor ( 1963 ) ' was my first film from samuel fuller , and there i was impressed with the director 's astute blending of b-movie and big-budget aesthetics , even if the story itself was pure schlock . 'pickup on south street ( 1953 ) ' was released a decade earlier in fuller 's career , obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio , twentieth century-fox . nevertheless , the visuals are still notable in that there 's a somewhat raw , naturalistic element to the photography , not unlike dassin 's 'the night and the city ( 1950 ) ' and kazan 's 'panic in the streets ( 1950 ) ' { the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald } . in some scenes , fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors ' faces that they 're out of focus , bluntly registering the intimate thoughts , emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features , the eye . though ( unexpectedly ) prone to melodrama , and with just a hint of anti-communist propaganda , 'pickup on south street ' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of new york city . when just-out-of-prison pickpocket skip mccoy ( richard widmark ) snags the purse of a woman on the subway ( jean peters ) , he pockets more than he 'd originally bargained for . the woman , candy , and her cowardly ex-boyfriend joey ( richard kiley ) had been smuggling top-secret information to the communists , and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film . will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities , or sell it to the highest bidder ? if 'pickup on south street ' has a flaw , it 's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-communist agenda , reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii { dwight taylor , who supplied the story , also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home ( 1944 ) , ' the only propagandistic movie of the series } . for no apparent reason , every identifiable character  even the smugly self-serving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot , the transformation predictable from the outset . in traditional film noir , the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance , the rational punishment for his sins , but apparently not when they 've served their country ; patriotism wipes the slate clean . richard widmark , an actor who i 'm really beginning to like , plays the haughty pickpocket with composure , though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he 's biting off more than he can chew . the opening scene on the train is the film 's finest , as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim 's hand bag , recalling bresson 's 'pickpocket ( 1959 ) . ' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who 'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it ( though , of course , she draws the line at commies ) . jean peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side , playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour ; fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute . nevertheless , peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film 's attempts at realism . fascinatingly , upon its release , 'pickup on south street ' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi , and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite . go figure .
my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse : in may 2003 i saw alfred hitchcock 's psycho , i was very scared and deeply disturbed . i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way . but none where satisfactory . amongst those tried and failed were the birds , night of the living dead , the silence of the lambs , the blair witch project , ring , the evil dead , the sixth sense , 28 days later , the texas chainsaw massacre , halloween , near dark , alien , peeping tom , the cell , rosemary 's baby , do n't look now , witchfinder general , friday the 13th and the omen . that should confirm i was desperate ! long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse . paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own , called marianne dreams . paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films , but they did n't tell me about the link between book and film . i discovered the truth while on the internet , i bought the film later that day . i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull . unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not . it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same . one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book ( nothing remarkable about that ) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house ( and i mean genuinely unnerving ) . more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld , eg an apple tree . anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world . mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house , obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse ( a place to go to ) but still the problem remains mark ca n't walk . so anna decides to draw her father in . she gets her pencil out and gets too work , but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes . quote `` he looks like madman '' . so anna tries to rub him out and start again , but the pencil proves indelible ( that means nothing can be rubbed out ) . then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father 's eyes ! i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action . paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street ! the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset . but i have found what i was looking for after 2 years . the question is how dose the compare with psycho ? answer , 1 the old dark house , 2 psychological parental fears , 3 a genuine shock , 4 and very scary music .
it 's a colorful slasher movie . that 's about it . it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies , but i never care for such things . figuring out who 's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway . the death scenes were inventive and gorey , bringing back memories of 80 's horror movies like friday the 13th . another nice thing about this movie is that it 's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl , unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious . people who do n't like slasher movies wo n't like this movie . as simple as that . i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same . -- mb

i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode . i remember when i used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon , however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill . the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie ( i 'm not sure which one that is ) . from there the next series ( friends with dreama ) was still really good , but when she left high school it just did n't seem right . all the main characters seemed to have left , which meant that it did n't have as much of the old `` sparkle '' , however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable , however when her aunt 's leave and sabrina moves into their house it just is n't right . she is no longer a teenager , so therefore the name of the show is n't right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just does n't seem right , especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that is n't harvey . thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away . all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch , but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school . because after that the show definitely lost some of it 's magic
next to `` star wars '' and `` the wizard of oz , '' this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made . it 's a true shame it 's not as well-known as the former films ( maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings , and that it 's british , meaning a smaller market for films ) but its wonderful to know that it 's deserved that reputation . like all great family films , one can be a child , an adult , or even a teenager to enjoy this film ( i 'm currently 18 ) , but one must appreciate classic films first . i absolutely adore this film . it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa ( perhaps my favorite classic film score ) that rivals any john williams `` star wars '' score , a fast but not flashy pace , beautiful sets , dialog , and use of color ( both the sets and cinematography won oscars ) , and state-of-the-art oscar-winning special effects ( for the time , and some are still stunning ) . and , of course , june duprez 's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta-jones ' ( she even looks like jones in a way ! ) . in conclusion , this is one of my all-time favorite movie ( next to `` the adventures of robin hood '' ) and it truly deserves more attention . it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout , and , along with `` robin hood , '' it 's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed . stars : * * * * ( excellent )
when i first saw this movie , the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie . the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts . the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far . another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie . the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act , very anime . i think that it 's a really good movie to watch . ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 ( not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10 ) . ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans , you have to see it .
wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania 's but i would personally put it , in my top 5 , if not the top 3 . it has so many great things , and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era , which was wwe 's best era , in my opinion . hbk has the heart of a lion , and him putting over austin like he did , on his way out , was pure class on his part . it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see , and it has j.r and the king at their announcing best ! . matches . 15  team battle royal loud pop for l.o.d 's return . i 'm not a fan of battle royal 's , and this is yet another average one . very predictable , even when you 1st see it , it 's obvious l.o.d would win . looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though , definitely helps . 2/5 wwf light heavyweight championship taka michinoku|c| vs aguila . taka gets a surprising pop , with his entrance . fast , high-flying , and very exciting . if these two had more time , they would have surely tore the roof off , with their stuff . taka wins with the michinoku driver . 3 1/2 /5 wwf european championship . triple h|c| vs owen hart stipulation here , is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter . nice pop for owen , mixed reaction for trips . a really , really underrated match , that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania , actually . the two mixed together very well , and owen can go with anybody . trips wins , with chyna interference . 4/5 mixed tag match . marc mero & sable vs goldust & luna . defining pop for sable , unheard of that time , for woman . sable actually looks hot , and the crowd is just eating her up ! . constant sable chants , and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring . not bad for a mixed tag match , it had entertaining antics , and passed the time well . sable 's team wins , when sable hits the tko . 2 1/2 /5 wwf intercontinental championship . ken shamrock vs the rock|c| . before i review the match , i 'd like to note the rock showed off his immense potential , with his interview with jennifer flowers , before his match . nice pop for shamrock , big time heat for the rock . too disappointingly short , and i thought the ending was kinda stupid , though shamrock 's snapping antics were awesome to see , and the crowd went nuts for it . rock keeps the title , when the ref reverses the decision . 2/5 dumpster match , for the wwf tag team championship catcus jack & terry funk vs the new age outlaws . the outlaws are not as over , as they were gon na be at this time . crowd is actually somewhat dead for this , but i thought it had some great hardcore bits , with some sick looking bumps . cactus and terry win the titles in the end . 3/5 the undertaker vs kane . big time ovation , for the undertaker . much better than there outing at wrestlemania 20 , and for a big man vs big man match , this was really good . it was a great all out brawl , with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump , through the table . wwe was smart , by making kane looking strong , even through defeat . after 2 tombstone kick out 's , taker finally puts him away , with a 3rd one . 3 1/2 /5 wwf championship . special guest enforcer `` mike tyson '' hbk|c| vs steve austin . big heat for tyson . crowd goes ape sh * t for austin , definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard . mixed reaction , for hbk . this is truly a special match up , one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history , you can tell when j.r is even out of breath . hbk gives it his all , in what was supposed to be his last match , and austin has rarely been better . the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing , and it 's as exciting as it gets . austin wins with the stunner , with tyson joining 3:16 by knocking out michaels . austin 's celebratory victory , is a wonder to behold , with one of the nosiest crowd 's you will ever see , king said it right , they were going nuts . 5/5 bottom line . wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real . it has everything you want in a wrestlemania , and truly kick started the attitude era . this is very special to me , because it was the 1st wrestlemania i ever saw , back in 98 . `` the austin era , has begun ! '' 9 1/2 /10
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film ? i love it ! one of my top 10 films of all time . it just makes me feel good . i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over ! ! ! bebe benson ( michelle johnston ) is the babe of the film , imho ! i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film . the two are like apples and oranges . the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work . i believe it 's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen are n't changed more than they are . this is a very good film , it is very satisfying . that 's all you need to know !
there is so much that can be said about this film . it is not your typical nunsploitation . of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story . it is set in 15th century italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto . the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film . it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , `` why do you fear the muslims , ; they will not do anything that the christians have done to you ? '' certainly , there was enough torture on both sides . sister flavia ( florinda bolkan ) is sent to a convent for defying her father . in the process , she witnesses and endures many things : the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew . the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off . sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives . she even asks jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men . eventually , she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . but , tragedy is to come . she manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the duke and her father , but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same . she is a woman and that is all there is to it . i wo n't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades . nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest .
this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time & through time to when one 's childhood starts a journey to reminiscences back & forth onwards & upwards , forwards & backwards , up & down & all around.the boy jimmy , h.r . puffinstuff , dr.blinky , cling & clang , ludicrous lion , & even the evil witchie poo too through & through . the latter day inspirations of lidsville , '' the brady kids saturday morning preview special '' sigmund & the sea monsters , and land of the lost both the new & old are what this very show bridged the gap to as well as the donny & marie show , the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a . brady bunch hour & even the paul lynde halloween special . maybe even other things in between & beyond the buck just keeps on moving on & on & even beyond expectations & as well as unexpected bounds.now as we get updated in march of '06 we know that jack wild 's gone & so now it make 's it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic.including now in august of '06 both when jack wild guest stars as himself on sigmund and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h.r.puffinstuff does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic journeys of all the syd & marty kroft characters as well including the h.r.puffinstuff goodtime club ; the donny and marie show ; the brady bunch variety hour a.k.a . the brady bunch hour ; etc . truthfully , stephen `` steve '' g. baer a.k.a . `` ste '' of framingham , ma.usa .
this is a great film classic from the 40 's and well produced . there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john garfield , ( al schmid ) , '' force of evil '' , '48 and dane clark , ( lee diamond ) , '' last rites '' , '88 , fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun . when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury , his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend . dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond , who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again . there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets !
this movie was an impressive one . my first experience with a foreign film , it was neither too long , nor too complex . i myself enjoyed the subtitles ; and the plot was surprisingly fresh . the story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first , but it proved to be very touching and realistic . there was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience .
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they 're supposed to be spying on ? and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal . but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense . you can see real people behind the unreal lines . and the directing is wonderful . each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long . i showed this to several friends in the mid-80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie . the friends enjoyed it too .
the japanese `` run lola run , '' his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about anyone 's face . fans of run lola run , tampopo , go ! , and slacker will probably like this one . it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate , seemingly unrelated vignettes , all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways . catch it if you see it , otherwise wait for the rental .
'had ned kelly been born later he probably would have won a victoria cross at gallipolli ' . such was ned 's bravery . in australia and especially country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and immediately recognised . in greta he is still a hero , the life blood of the town of jerilderie depends on the tourism he created , but in mansfield they still have n't forgotten that the three policeman that he 'murdered ' were from there . many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing . from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged , to the post office he held up in jerilderie . a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of ann jones ' hotel , the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited . evidence of all the events in the movie ( except for his love interest ) can be found all over victoria , in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning . none of this is wrong , and whats left out would further justify neds actions . the horse that ned 'stole ' was actually stolen by wild wright ( the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail ) . ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he could n't have stolen it . the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before . it is not self justification it is ned 's biography , an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting . so go ahead and read it , watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for .
i do n't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves . i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake , especially for originality . yes the scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting frightner , but why not ? no one else is willing to go that far . i really have n't had this much fun watching a movie since candyman . so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow , even his mom does n't care about him . then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow , who then goes on a killing spree . his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going . the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors , but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool , these folks who wan na make movies of a newer genre . over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs , with one liners you 'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick . i would say , grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a $ $ off with this movie . i love it for its originality , most fun .
it all starts with a suicide . or is it a car crash ? i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end . director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning , showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call . this is one powerful movie ; maybe that is because i 'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk , dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances , but either way , a film works best when it truly touches me , when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre . and this is from the team that brought us the overrated , sappy , and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness , so i 'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown . with all that , though , i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled . even though you figure out what will smith 's character is doing , that secret mission he is trying to complete , it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end . our entry point is a bit jarring , leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on . smith 's thomas has lists of names , one of people we do n't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit . working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give thema gift that could completely alter their circumstances . he calls an old childhood friend ( barry pepper ) and reminds him to do what it is he promised , to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind . even in a role as small as pepper 's , you ca n't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background , hanging above everyone 's head . it is his character , seen maybe three times , that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with . his breakdowns , whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions , show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way . after that phone call , begins the journey to meet new people . thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk , trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival . this progression takes many turns , from a `` blind , vegan , meat salesman '' that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode ; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient , unable to print her line of stationary , or even run with her great dane duke ; to an abused and scared latino mother of two , too afraid to leave her boyfriend ; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community ; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant . there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day , and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style . why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his `` gift '' is unknown at first , as is why this man , seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home , is now living in a motel , driving a beat-up car , going door to door in order to audit for the irs . as he says , though , `` he kind of stumbled into the job '' . smith 's quest as thomas is a long and painful one , tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion . as a man with the means to help , he takes his job seriously , crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree . if that means he must yell and make fun of them , he must do it . at every step , though , you see the suffering in his eyes , the pain eating away at his soul , taking each step towards his fate , one as a saint of redemption , not only for those he wants to help , but for himself as well . it is an award-worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles , because , while they are fun , this guy is too good for them . the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyat least in my mind . the rest of the cast is stellar across the board . woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life . his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout , whether on the phone being yelled at , sitting in a diner eating his pie , or at the piano in the park , playing for all who will listen . elpidia carrillo , as the abused mother , is fantastic , showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger , allowing her family to finally be safe . and rosario dawson shines as the `` once hot '' young woman , beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays , all but given up on living life to find love and happiness . it is the introduction of smith 's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman , a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last .
i acquired this , one of my all-time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual , during viewing , the whole thing just blew me away . i am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears , especially the `` will you '' track . it 's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth . this rates second best to quadrophenia ( which also starred phil daniels ) . a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80 's in which i grew up . the ending is so sad , for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby . i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing , i can watch it over and over again and never be bored , simply for the soundtrack alone . hazel , sorry to hear about your dad darling . god bless you all . xx
i loved kolchak : the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september 13 , 1974 . i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle ( hey , where 's the soundtrack guys ? ) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple , important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level . when darren mcgavin 's carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations , he reacts like most people would . he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger , he is frightened , even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode . it 's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force . he 's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works . sometimes , he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are . in one episode , he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it , he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly , he must go back and defend himself . he 's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably would n't do but that does n't mean he probably would n't much rather someone else did it instead of him . he 's a regular guy , doing a job , trying to make a buck , not a monster-hunter . he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural , which he has an interest in but he does n't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do . if his plan to defeat the creature did n't work , you will often see him running for his life to get away from it , which is of course what i would do in the situation . that 's why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid . kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him . you were scared for him and for the other characters too . the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit , scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it 's all for naught if you do n't care about the characters . darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a `` monster of the week '' show and he decided not to continue . i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but , as an adult , i can see why it could n't go on in that formula for very long . i still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling , determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the ins , known as carl kolchak . i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show . it 's not the monsters , darkly-lit sets , creepy music or goofy guest stars , although they are all vital ingredients . the secret to it 's success is right there in the title - `` kolchak : the night stalker '' . without mcgavin 's lovable , bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for , then it just ai n't a night stalker .
i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites ' . as blood rites was entirely awful , i really was n't expecting much from this film ; but actually , it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation . the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites , as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit , and of course ; there is an inheritance at stake . the film is shot in black and white , and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp ' . there 's barely any gore on display , and the director seems keener to focus on sex , with themes of incest and hatred seeping through . the acting is typically trashy , but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation , director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing , as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful . the plot is paper thin , and most of the film is filler ; but the music is catchy , and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves , as most are somewhat erotic . overall , this is not a great film ; but it 's likely to appeal to the cult fan , and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites ' .
i had the privilege to see this movie at the intenational film festival of rotterdam . 'xizhao ' or 'shower ' is a $ 200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons . the father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional chinese village where local , mostly aged men , come to relax and to go bathing . the father has to sons : a 'retarded ' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him . to this son the traditional village , the bathhouse and his 'retarded ' brother seem strange and annoying , but this changes along the movie . though the story may sound cheesy or cliche , it 's not . with really great performances , especially of the father and the 'retarded ' son ( sorry , i do n't know their names ) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time . if you got a chance to see this movie do it . it 's a great alternative to mainstream hollywood cinema .
this is n't among jimmy stewart 's best films -- i 'm quick to admit that . however , while some view his film as pure propaganda , i 'm wondering what 's so wrong with that ? yes , sure , like the tv show the fbi , this is an obvious case of the bureau doing some pr work to try to drum up support . but , as entertainment goes , it does a good job . plus , surprisingly enough for the time it was made , the film focuses more on crime than espionage and `` commies '' . instead , it 's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose . now considering the agent is played by jimmy stewart , then it 's pretty certain the acting and writing were good -- as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who was n't about to waste the star in a third-rate flick . so overall , it 's worth seeing but not especially great .
its not sophisticated , and nobody in the credits had a great career , but taken as a whole , because there are no famous personalities ; the film seems more realistic than some high budget , well cast films . a film made for a few bucks , that is worthy of watching should give hope to all those would be film makers and wantabee actors . the problem with this film is it was made in the worst possible time . tv was taking over the revenues of the film industry , and this film could have easily been shown on tv . in 1950 , all the fare on tv would qualify for a `` g '' rating . the film industry began to make more `` adult '' films that could not be shown on tv during the days when tv would n't dare show the sex and skin of today 's commercials .
okay , i 'll admit the casting in the film is really strange -- part of this is due to the plot , but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead ( though he really did a pretty good job ) . it 's based on a true story of an englishman who went to live with the canadian indians in the early 20th century . he claimed to be a mixed blood indian . he was , in fact , so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken on his wilderness treks -- even though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or faked ! the movie centers on this and what occurred when the hoax was uncovered . the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film ( once i suspended disbelief about brosnan ) . it did n't get widespread distribution -- probably because it was pretty cerebral -- not a bond film nor a romance -- just a really odd film about a remarkable man .
what would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a hawaiian guy bar ? all smooth sailing until he takes his `` bachelor hat '' off . what would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her ? what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance ? a new low , right ? well paul coleman , played comically by jason lee , leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low . i got to say this is one of his good leading roles . however i do believe his role in vanilla sky was better acted . his finance named karen is played by the up-and-down actress selma blair while karen 's character , becky , is played by the lovely and talented julia stiles . getting back to where we left off , paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another . he gets diseases , has to deal with certain people , and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get p.o'ed , including one of his relatives that has n't had a `` bowel movement '' for 14 days . * vomit * all of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that paul and his brother had to go through . overall , a guy thing is quite funny and is all right . sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it 's a mixed movie . and if you 're a canadian and a fellow fan of the ctv brett butt sitcom , corner gas , you 'd recognize a small role played by fred ewanuick , the same man who plays the hilarious hank in the series . this movie is all right . it 's another feather in lee 's hat ( quite an empty hat so far , however ) . my rating : 7/10 eliason a .
i could n't agree more with the other comment , it 's like falling down . peter weller is ok and william hurt great as always , except in lost in space . this is a good movie . with pretty good performances . very recommendable . if you like falling down you 're going to enjoy this one . 8 of 10
bette davis ' cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling . i totally understand that americans and other nationalities might n't realise this and that 's fine ; but believe me , it 's about half as good as dick van dyke 's cockney accent in mary poppins , and that was a right load of old pony ( slipped into london vernacular there - many apologies ) . the remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles do n't detract from the films ' power . of human bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults . it also has to be viewed in perspective . the technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated , and given those limitations john cromwell does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop cinematically rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue . a fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at victoria station . it is beautifully conceived , shot and edited . note too the stark shots of the prostrate mildred towards the end of the film ; they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised , formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate . the themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones : sexual obsession , unrequited love , scorned passion , self-loathing , manipulative relationships , social divides and youthful folly . though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed , the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is tackled well albeit in a low-key way . some of the scenes of obsession and emotional rejection are uncomfortable to watch but the story does n't descend into cliché ; we 're aware that the characters ( even the poisonous mildred ) are both victims and perpetrators , and that their actions are motivated by their misunderstanding of each others feelings as well as by wilful selfishness . whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating exchanges do n't diminish the veracity of the work . of human bondage was one of the films that got bette davis noticed in hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career . her unconventional beauty and screen charisma ( no one flounced or did disdain quite like ms davis ) grab your attention from her first appearance . whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film , leslie howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student philip carey . they are a good combination , though , why oh why did n't he help her with that terrible , terrible accent ! ?
whereas the hard-boiled detective stories of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern american genre and style in the process - those of what might be called golden age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever . the problem with books like those of agatha christie , dorothy l. sayers or s.s. van dine ( on whose work this film is based ) , is that they are low on action or variety - whereas sam spade or philip marlowe traverse the mean streets of la , working class tenements , bars , offices , wealthy mansions , and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence , golden age fiction is generally fixed in location , the scene of the murder , usually a lavish country house , and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects . this is a very static procedure , plot reduced to puzzle . this , of course , is as much ideological as anything else , the golden age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement ; the hard-boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre ( both of authority , and of a city ) , dividing itself up into hostile , ever uncontrollable and lawless camps . another major problem with golden age fiction is character - because we can not know the answer to the crime until the end , we can not gain access to characters ' motivations or emotions , being defined solely by their potential need to murder . the detective , unlike the anxious , prejudice-ridden private eyes , are simply there to be brilliant , and maybe a little eccentric . the problem with most films from golden age books is that they try to be period recreations of the merchant ivory/jane austen school , and end up looking silly . there have been successes , for example the radical reworkings of ellery queen and others by claude chabrol . in the english-speaking world , there have really only been two . the alistair sim classic , 'green for danger ' , works because it pushes the form almost into parody , while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery . before that came michael curtiz 's brilliant 'the kennel murder case ' . the narrative is pure golden age . a repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him . he is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner , indicating suicide , slumped in a locked room . the caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait . it is up to philo vance , gentleman and amateur detective , neither old nor fat , to read the clues more insightfully , open the case out of the confines of the room , and eventually solve the case , the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation . what is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining , and full of comical bits of business . there is n't even really an attempt to 'subvert ' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect , with no protest from vance , but that 's about it . what marks 'kennel ' as a classic is its modernity . curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur , because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development . but he was hollywood 's greatest craftsman , and he is on sensational form here . if the golden age detective story is mere puzzle , curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme , creating an abstract variation on his source , reducing narrative , character and location to geometry , a series of lines , from the beautiful art-deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and , as they glide furiously at an angle , jolt the dead decor to life . this treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism , it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors , like the two central brothers , or the original crime itself , borrowed from an 'unsolved mysteries ' book . this fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect oriental relics ( shades of 'the moonstone ' ? ) , inscrutable chinese servants , ex-cons turned butlers , dog-loving fops , runyonesque cops , is the perfect habitat for vance , a man who will drop a cruise to europe on a fanciful hunch , who knows the social world of these people , and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police , or would be if he was n't anything more than a thinking machine , william powell , the greatest american comedian of the decade , bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity . but if the treatment is rarefied , the climax is spectacularly brutal , involving vicious dogs and attempted murder . the police and the detective , supposed to be preventing crime , are guilty of inciting one .
i personally watched this to see the footage of the 60 's and 70 's . it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life . the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous . you feel like you 're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same time ... because it feels so good and familiar . i loved it , all segments from 60's-present day . i highly recommend this for all aspects , including rock music , the hipper movement , politics and good 'ol history . i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler , only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards , since i discussed what 's in all 4 segments , so just wanted to be safe .
this film is a great fun . i recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends . i did last night and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world ! i did feel a little bit strange watching my friends go through the same roller coaster as i did the first time . but they all thanked me and loved the movie . you know it is a great film if you spend 2 hours after the film talking about the movie ! i once saw a con man almost up tonorma khouri 's level , but no where near the same size ring . he fooledtons of very gullible and rich folks at my old berkeley ca a.a. group where everyone trusts everyone else . he would `` sponsor '' only people who seemed very well to do . who knew he would have stolen in excess of 100k ( in 1987 when that was real money ) after being in town for only 1 month . his victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week of being sober . he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face . the above crime is nothing compared to what norma khouri did to her old neighbor . but i do n't want to give anything away . i just found this one night on a late night movie channel , '' showtim '' i think . this is always a movie fans greatest experience to be totally tricked into seeing something and having your mind blown . just drag your friends over to see this and do n't tell them a thing . it is a very entertaining film , it moves quickly and never bores you . this should be a international classic for all time . i believe all great movies eventually rise to the top . time will be very good to this film . i am just sorry no one has heard of it yet , in some ways that makes the surprises even better . the director and editor were fantastic . they deserved winning the best documentary . just watch this film !
very funny , well-crafted , well-acted , meticulous attention to detail . a real window into a specific time and place in history . could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe . interesting how passport to pimlico anticipates the berlin airlift . a definite 10 .
larry fessenden has been thrashed by most of the comments on this forum . well , the worst mistake , evidently , is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted . obviously , this is not a true horror movie , at least , not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying . `` wendigo '' is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles . things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they ca n't comprehend . it is obvious that kim , the mother , is a psychologist , but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son . this is also a story of alienation . it 's clear that the father , george , is a distant figure , perhaps a workaholic , who seems to be living in a different world . miles ' fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country . that part of new york state , with its winter landscape , barren trees , play havoc on the little boy 's imagination . it does n't help that he encounters a strange figure in town , it creates even more doubts in his young mind . ultimately , miles ' world comes crashing down on him and he ca n't do anything , even evoking the wendigo spirit . the film is well paced and acted . patricia clarkson is excellent , no matter where movie she is in . jake weber is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he does n't understand . erik per sullivan , as miles , conveys the inner turmoil within him . i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what 's going on around him . finally , john spredakos is perfect as the menacing otis , a man who resents the world for the way he has turned out . instead of putting this movie down , future viewers should approach it with a open mind .
i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me . laputa , whose title seems to have affected its release in the u.s. to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences , has the cartoonish knack of the director 's debut production conan . in fact , pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan -- who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet , then started running . this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch . the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa -- the only exception may be the robot . unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds , the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism . if it has a theme at all it 's anti-warfare . the importance of living naturally -- this is related with the flying castle , is dismissably shortly discussed , and not really followed through . overall , i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny .
i have watched this movie well over 100-200 times , and i love it each and every time i watched it . yes , it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable . the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as camp really is , a great place to spend the summer . everyone who has ever gone to camp , wanted to go to camp , or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it 'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids .
i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place . however , the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people . the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film , the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards . there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better . all in all , this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film can not be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream . it 's a thrilling and interesting movie experience .
the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor . it has a deeper plot , better character development , and the tunes ( especially the closing song ) are both catchy and warm-hearted . sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on , it is a care bears movie . this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship , love , and again , caring . not to mention the care bears are just too adorable !
i completely disagree with the other comments posted on this movie . for instance , the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it then how could `` hollywood '' just throw in a token gay character in the movie . and besides there was two gay characters and i thought they reflected each other great . one was normal and the other was more feminine but it was n't over the top . and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to actual watch the entire film they would have seen that her character developed through out the film by interacting with the other characters . for instance when she and adam went to look at the car that sara crashed in the junkyard you could see the maternal side of her come out and later in the film you saw that she too was invincible . but i guess if you 're too worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad . but if you 're more open-minded and i do n't know actually have some inkling of what is good then you 'll enjoy this film .
this was one of the all time best episodes . officer sean cooper was murdered in his patrol car back in '68 . a dying convict in the state penitentiary reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting . his case is reopened with the presumption that he was corrupted as a policeman . further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love . this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time . while this is n't the type of love i personally support , he was still a policeman and a human being and should n't have been killed for it . the sound track was excellent ( keeps me watching the dvr ) , and the selective use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing . i shall be watching this one in repeat !
channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels , this show was certainly a naughty one . the presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show , four-time bafta winning and british comedy award winning ( also twice nominated ) graham norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this . it had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it . they basically had an adult idea which would either gross , humiliate or humour the guest , but some are not for the faint-hearted . they had women playing the recorder with their parts , men using their dicks to play a xylophone , women weeing upwards in the bath , men with or without pants under their kilts , and many more gross but hilarious ideas . this is just for adults , but enjoy it ! it won the bafta twice for best entertainment ( programme or series ) , it won the british comedy awards for best comedy entertainment programme ( also nominated ) , best comedy talk show , it won an emmy for episode # 18 ( ? ) , and it won the national television awards twice for most popular talk show . it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny moments . very good !
miike makes a children 's adventure film , not unlike the neverending story . it 's actually one of my least favorite of the director 's films . even the worst miike is better than a good many films , though , and the great yokai war has a lot in it that 's worth recommending . it 's at least as loud and obnoxious as most american kiddie flicks . i might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it ( the dvd includes an english dub ) , but , like all of miike 's films , it can tend to move very slowly . that means you 've got kind of a weird unevenness , where sometimes there 's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse . the story itself is n't very good , either , and miike 's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head . most of what i liked came from the technical side of things . this has to be miike 's most expensive movie , and it looks fantastic . `` yokai '' are japanese spirits , and they come in all different , fantastical forms , and the costume designers , special effects crew , and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job . i 've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on ( yokai monsters : spook warfare ) , and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state-of-the-art makeup and special effects . i especially liked the look of one of the bad guys ( or girls , in this case ) , agi , who sports dark eye shadow , a tight , white outfit , a white beehive hairdo and a whip . she 's played , incidentally , by chiaki kuriyama , whom you might remember as lucy liu 's teenage henchgirl in kill bill : vol . 1 . the hero of the film is played by ryunosuke kamiki , who provided voices for miyazaki 's spirited away and howl 's moving castle .
again , it seems totally illogical , to me at least , that `` arthur '' merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible . steve gordon 's one-shot masterpiece herein is the totally `` unlikely '' if not quite `` impossible '' melding of wildly disparate elements . that he managed to make alcoholism laugh-friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is , in itself , wonderful . that he gave dudley moore his finest role , and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact , including the score , seems to me patent and egregious . i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud . but , apparently , nearly a third of its audience has so managed . well , i , for one , found and find gordon 's effort both laughable and lovable , and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald 's great-aunt and stephen elliott 's murderous would-be father-in-law absolute gems of background characters . even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization , and the late , sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee , but wrong about undertaking his role . `` arthur '' makes no effort to `` underztand , '' much less rationalize , the scourge of `` alcoholism '' ( hey , ifit ai n't booze , it 's other drugs of choice , including meth , and addictions are merely symptoms , not targets ) , it simply observes in its own quizzical manner .
i watched this movie once and might watch it again , but although jamie foxx is good in the movie , i feel they could have used a 'less funny ' character as alvin sanders . foxx 's scenes for instance in the jail when he is confronted by edgar clenteen ( david morse ) are too funny . david morse again is a wonderful portrayer of a cop . his tough yet mostly quiet features are perfect for his role . once again morse meets doug hutchinson ( bristol ) in the theater . morse ends up coming down hard on hutchinson . they are both perfect for this scenario in each film . i personally love that quality in a film , where actors end up in the same situation as a previous film , as these two did in the green mile . overall it was a pretty good movie .
has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when hagarty 's wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake . i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television . when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the `` waiter '' laughed at the end . i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter . listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby , then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter , albeit , quickly .
a strong pilot , this two-hour episode does an excellent job of setting up the characters and background for `` enterprise , '' the `` prequel '' to the original `` star trek '' series . it stumbles a few times into `` trek '' convention and cliché -- candy-colored space strippers never seem to go out of style , and i can already foresee snickering references to t'pol as `` seven of vulcan '' -- but the ensemble looks strong , the characters are well-drawn , and one can already see hints that this particular crew will have to be more resourceful , in different ways , than those of earlier ( later ? ) series . scott bakula hits the right note as a captain with kirk 's brashness and daring but without his smugness and swagger , and i look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer , weapons master and communications officer ( not just a glorified phone operator anymore ! ) as supporting players . the writers seem to have picked up on the one big mistake made in `` star trek : the next generation , '' `` deep space 9 '' and `` voyager '' : instead of starting with a big ensemble cast and giving characters short shrift , it 's starting with a smaller core of characters to which a little more variety can be added later -- which i hope happens , because after about a half-dozen episodes , more variety will be needed .
vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos ( open your eyes ) . and in my opinion , a much more human and emotional version . tom cruise plays david aames , a selfish egomaniac who takes other people 's emotions for granted , and thinks only of himself . jason lee plays brian shelby , david 's best , and in many ways , only friend . penelope cruz plays sofia serrano , brian 's girlfriend whom accompanies him to david 's birthday party . cameron diaz plays julie gianni , david 's occasional bed buddy . kurt russell plays dr. curtis mccabe , a psychologist interviewing david . all of their interactions , and the consequences of them , make vanilla sky one of the most emotional , and complex thrillers ever made . i wo n't explain anymore of the plot , because it 's far more compelling , the less you know . ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow . if you pay attention , you wo n't be confused . the film is very complex , but not confusing . and in my opinion , one of the best movies ever made .
while rome goes mad celebrating hitler 's visit - uniforms , bands , parades - two outsiders stay home , in a large building , and wind up meeting . she is sofia loren , who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children . he is mastroianni , a radio speaker who 's been fired because of his homosexuality . both of them need company and understanding , both f them find it in each other . the movie covers a span of a few hours . the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers . strangely enough , the nazi anthem - the horst-wessel-lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme . beautiful movie , excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching , sad story . mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job , very far away from her usual truck driver 's pin-up , neapolitan fishwife personas . do n't miss it .
an old saying goes `` if you think you have problems , visit a hospital . '' that has been updated in recent years to `` if you think you have problems , watch a tv talk show ... especially jerry springer 's ! '' this movie is one of those that is so bad , it 's good ! that 's why i gave it a seven-it 's all right , but not great . it 's a great way to waste 95 minutes , just as the daily talk show is advertised as `` an hour of your life you 'll never get back ! '' all the familiar themes are here ... unfaithful husbands/boyfriends , the wildest audience on television , women flashing jerry , etc . the shocker was watching molly hagan , who normally plays sweet characters ( `` seinfeld '' and `` herman 's head '' ) playing a trailer-trash mom and jaime pressly ( `` my name is earl '' ) as her equally trashy daughter , performing sexual favors for virtually every man with whom they came in contact . the men ( including the staff producer ) were presented as quintessential lunkheads who deserved what they got . i do n't want to spoil or reveal everything but the movie plays like the daily show . here in phoenix , it 's shown back-to-back for two hours every morning and , after that , everything else seems to pale . again , i give this movie a seven ... it 's good but not great . jerry springer is best taken in small one hour doses .
i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today . i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch ! i am so glad i saw it , and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time . this movie is so wonderful ! it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe . the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are . some people have said this is a kids movie . i disagree - it may be made by disney and many characters are children , but i am 23 and i loved it ! there were moments when my spine tingled . the story is unlike any other film these days , full of adventure . i have just ordered the book from amazon , ca n't wait !
ying , a chinese girl who speaks czech , invited us to screening of a czech movie ( with english subtitles ) in the department of visual and environmental studies ( ves ) . it was the first time i saw samotá & # 345 ; i ( loners , 2000 ) and it was pretty good . much like in many other czech movies , the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult , dirty life ; the web indicates that this theme was popular among the u.s. movies in the early 1990s . their relationships are breaking up , combining , and recombining . another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either . also , you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context ; that 's a very realistic feature of the movie 's psychological analysis . ond & # 345 ; ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters . nevertheless , you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman , hanka . he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hanka 's parents ' house - a house that he repeatedly burns . meanwhile , hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents . she just decides - by tossing up a coin - to break up with petr who works in a private radio station . hanka does not view her parents ' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment . but she is a very flexible figure , as far as the type of her boyfriends go . for a while , hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub , an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs . however , the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend . hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents . when hanka and petr break up , it is organized by robert , a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists . robert - who also provides jakub with marijuana - is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women ; eventually , his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression . vesna ( a slavic word for `` spring '' ) who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid - and you wo n't learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos . she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems . petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job that he eventually loses . he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka - which is how ond & # 345 ; ej learns about the news that make him very happy . finally , ond & # 345 ; ej 's wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after ond & # 345 ; ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ond & # 345 ; ej can try to capture hanka again . ( the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident - jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ond & # 345 ; ej saves his life . ) lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents ' dinner . the seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude . given the actual size of the czech capital , it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people , but it is fun .
this is a short , crudely animated series by david lynch ( as it says in the beginning ) , and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods , overall-wearing large man , with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son . both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes , and there 's no real plot to be seen . it 's easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd , slightly macabre looney tunes- with far more gore , profanity , bloody violence , and occasional moments of hilarity . i bought the dvd along with eraserhead , having previously seen eraserhead . do n't look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece- this is anything but . in fact , it seems to almost be a statement against such things , as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see . as lynch says , `` if this is funny , it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all . ''
this would have been my number one movie of the year for 1991 , except it got beat out by the brilliant jfk . this is such a wonderful movie ! i loved it . i love stories where different characters ' lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives . kevin kline is good here , but is outshined by danny glover and , especially , steve martin . i 've never much like martin or his style , but here he is great . i loved the whole speech he gave to kline near the end about the grand canyon . the writing was excellent . larry kasdan is , imo , a great dialogue writer , along the ways of kevin smith and quentin tarantino . here , he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines , and messages that give a positive feel to our lives . a truly excellent film . 4 out of 4 stars
dear god where do i begin . this is bar none the best movie i 've ever seen . the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best . why the script writers for this movie are n't writing big budget films i will never understand . another is the cast . it is great . this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure . i know some of you out there are probably thinking `` no way he has plenty better '' but no your wrong . raptor island is a work of art . i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors . i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever .
the quintessential road movie ... if your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani . ( well , one out of four ai n't bad ... ) a no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship ( max ) watches a very skilled pickpocket ( hugo ) plying his trade in new york . after convincing hugo that he ( max ) is a ) mental and b ) desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive , the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions ( milo ) and the , ah , gentler attributes of a lovely waitress ( lydia ) . the unlikely four pile into a van ( obtained by hugo ... you guess where it came from ) and head to vegas . havoc ensues . anyhow , it 's funny , it 's well-written , and the ending is surprisingly good . a solid comedy with a warm heart , and all the better that it was totally unexpected .
the men can slaver over lollo , if they like ( or her lollos -- she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in french ) , but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine gerard philipe , who is not only beautiful but can act . do n't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple , dashing story of love and war , in which all is fair , they are not needed . all you need know is that , at the beginning of the film , lollobrigida reads philipe 's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king . thereafter the story is quite plain from the gallic gestures and the running , jumping , and swordplay . on the minus side , the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying , and it is annoying that the french apparently consider themselves too superior to hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts . and of course the non-french-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la , such as : virtuous girl : i must tell you that my heart belongs to fanfan . seducer : my dear , what made you think i was interested in that bagatelle ?
a young man named court is loved by everyone . his painful bloody death brings everyone closer . you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie . whether predictable or not , and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs , this is a moving story , full of milieu and sensuality . one other thing , someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it did n't seem plausible . but the elements for this are set up subtly . note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field . note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves . he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment . to this day , tractors are pretty dangerous .
i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love it.jason patric was perfect for this weird role that he played.the director ? i do n't too many things about him ... and i do n't care.the screenplay is good , that 's for sure.in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is weird , strange , even dark , but it 's a good one.i saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then.i want to see it again and again.i know that i 'm not gon na get sick of watching it.the scenes , the atmosphere , the actors , the story ... everything is good.the movie should have lasted longer.i think 120 minutes should have been perfect.i was hoping for a part 2 for this movie.too bad it di n't happened.jason patric : you 're the man ! very good movie . the end . : - )
( sorry for my faulty language , i am no native speaker ... ) yes , this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction . personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around . but i wo n't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here . because those `` perfect ! the one-and-only ! best-ever ! `` -reviews make some people turn away ( including me ) . so if you are looking for another 'hamlet ' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones - then do n't miss this one , if you happen to find it anywhere . ( unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it . it seems there is no dvd out there , and the german language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format . ) just in case you decide to get a copy : spare out that cut down two hours ( or so ) version of this movie . it is no use and no fun , and gives a wrong impression of a movie , that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture . and its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio . greetings from germany , f.l .
perfect movies are rare . even my favorite films tend to have flaws - rear window looks a little stagey at times , chris elliot 's character in groundhog day does n't work , the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy , the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish . the script is brilliant , the acting is superb all around ( although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing , the whole cast shines ) , the directing and the photography are inspired , and the music score is touching without being intrusive ( like some miramax scores that are too manipulative ) . every sad moment is truly moving , every light moment makes me smile . this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it . i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film , but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people , real feelings and real problems . brilliant ! a must-see .
if you like rap or hip-hop , watch this movie , although it 's funny if you do n't get the references , as a straight comedy . have n't seen much of the much hyped cb4 , but what i did see did n't have the heart that this little stormer has . have n't heard from the people involved since , which is a surprise . the film is very similar to spinal tap , which is no bad thing , and i think a lot of the dialogue , while priceless in tap is funnier here , probably because i 'm more into rap than rock theses days , so my own judgment does cloud that point . the rap songs are funny as hell , and it 's basically spot the reference for most of the film , not all of them are in-your-face , which means the physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over the take-offs . great fun , one to watch twice if there ever was a movie .
i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art . i was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2 . not only does guy bring together a b list ( ish ) movie cast and make them into such glorious characters , he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination . far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate ... yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable . this film is special . get it , now !
fair drama/love story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new love.the acting here is good but the film fails in cinematography , screenplay , directing and editing.the story/script is only average at best.this film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious level.it would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy .......
the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first . the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off . however , i was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this comedy central gem . i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy -- sarah 's character is a true sociopath , very comparable to sedaris ' jerri blank . the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast . her sister 's character is good ; funny at times , but ultimately meant not to steal sarah 's show . however , the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison . i 'm glad , though , that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor .
i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it , but have seen it 5 or more times ; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . kay kyser 's mysteries would be a good example . having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show , as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action , doing a fine job of support . hugh o'brien plays the face , buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus , abbott and costello replacing the leads . do n't know if that was true . all in all , a pleasant movie , but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history . wish that it was released , as i have n't seen or heard of it now in two decades . hope it is not lost
the tenants began as a 1971 short novel by the now deceased bernard malamud - writer/philosopher - examining the conflicts between jews and african americans in the incendiary atmosphere of brooklyn at the time the book was written . as a novel the story was gut wrenchingly real : as transcribed into a screenplay by novices david diamond and danny green ( who also directs ) it is more of a cerebral dissertation that gradually erupts into action in the final moments . harry lesser ( dylan mcdermott ) is a jewish novelist with one book under his belt but currently attempting to finish his 'newest ' book ten years into the writing . convinced that he must complete the novel in the same environment where it was started . he is the sole tenant in a condemned brooklyn tenement owned by levinspiel ( seymour cassel ) who constantly tries to 'buy out ' harry 's lease so that the filthy dilapidated building can be demolished . into this atmosphere enters another black militant quasi-anti-semitic writer willie spearmint ( snoop dogg ) whom harry befriends , hides , and offers help to the nascent novelist 's attempt to write about the death of all white people . harry 's attempts to help willie lead to conflict , not the least of which is harry 's meeting willie 's girlfriend , the white jewish irene bell ( rose byrne ) at a less than friendly gathering of willie 's militant black brothers and sisters . willie and irene are on the skids and harry gradually falls in love with irene and they plan to leave new york as soon as harry finishes his novel . when willie hears of the assignation and is further critiqued by harry , willie explodes and begins the downward descent of not only a delicate friendship but also a competition between writers . the ending 'reveals the slippery nature of the human condition , and the human capacity for violence and undoing ' . the actors do their best with a script that is a bit awkward but despite scripted lines that border on preaching they create believable characters . the cinematography enhances the story , keeping the mood dank and dense and primarily confined to the condemned building . the musical score appropriately makes use of the solo jazz trumpet and blues piano to underline the tension and isolation of each of these groundless characters . though it takes some patience to make it through the cerebral ramblings , the film in the end is worth watching . at least it attempts to recreate malamud 's bizarre look at life in the big city . grady harp
i just saw this film in santa barbara . my friend knew someone who worked on it , so i thought i 'd check it out . i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again . the actors were really good and i loved all the music ! there was not a lot of talking in the film , which at first felt a little strange- but once i got into it , i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination . i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things , but know that i left the theater thinking about the film . it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique .
that 's my bush is a live action project made by south park creators trey parker and matt stone.the show was cancelled after one season , not because of bad reviews ( it actually got good reviews ) , but because it was very expensive.that 's my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv sitcom.it is also a political satire.now , this is nowhere near as good as south park , but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire.the guy who plays in that 's my bush looks a lot like him ! if you can find the show , check it out.there are plenty of laughs to be had ! 9/10
i do n't have words to describe how good this movie is . only a genius like amrita pritam could have written such a real depiction of the days of partition . the movie kept haunting me for many days . urmila did the role of her life in this movie . she put life in the role of puroo and manoj vajpai did no less in his role as rashid . it is hard to imagine anyone other than these two doing the role of puroo and rashid . the punjabi costumes looked so natural on urmila and manoj looked like a natural punjabi mussalmaan . sandhali sinha as lajjo and suri as ramchand did fabulous job . priyanshu chattarjee did good work as triloki . some of the scenes you just ca n't get out of your mind . when puroo meets lajjo for the first time , it brings tears to your eyes . the climax is just killer . i was expecting a tragic ending but thankfully , the ending was wonderful . this movie is in the same category as pakeezah , mughal-e-azam , banaras etc . not to be missed .
i searched for this movie for years , apparently it ai n't available here in the states so bought me a copy off ebay . four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers . what they find is an ex-vietnam vet gone crazy ( he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la freddy krueger ) . as soon as the night falls , one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend , she gets killed . after one of the group finds her body , they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight . once the sun comes up , all of them try and make it out , but fall victim one by one . seven bodies , not a lot of gore , but a couple of good murders , especially the girls'deaths . the guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways ( blown up in car , shot to death , knife through head ) . overall , infernal trap is a nice slasher film from the late 80 's . nothing new , just well acted , fast paced and some pretty ladies . 10 out of 10 .
in canadian director kari skogland 's film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen burstyn is hagar shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well-meaning son marvin . filmed in manitoba , canada and set in the fictional town of manawaka , the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century . the title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on hagar 's mother 's grave which serves as a metaphor for hagar 's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego-driven , self-defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well-meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . as she nears the end of her days , she reflects that `` pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . i was alone , never anything else , and never free , for i carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all i touched '' . confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice-over narration . the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . chaperoned by her aunt dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married bram shipley ( cole/wings hauser ) , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the native american population . the young hagar is played by christine horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . despite hagar 's pleading , her relationship with bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty . going through the motions of her marriage to bram , hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes . when she produces two sons , marvin ( dylan baker ) and john ( kevin zegers ) , she is unable to give them the love that they need . `` every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning '' , she reflects , `` all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearances when did i ever speak the heart 's truth ? '' like the biblical hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , hagar leaves manawaka to live in ontario but eventually returns to the shipley farm . as the scene shifts back to the present , hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by marvin and his wife doris ( sheila mccarthy ) , here she meets a young man named leo ( luke kirby ) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story 's outcome , although the spirited performance by ellen page as john 's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film 's second half .
it 's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism . biko died for nothing much . woods achieved little . yes , outright apartheid was abolished , but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites , leaving the anc government more or less impotent . as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine , in the talks between the black and white leaderships `` the deklerk government had a twofold strategy . first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy , it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making -- - such as trade policy and the central bank -- - as `` technical '' or `` adminsitrative '' . then it used a wide range of new policy tools -- - international trade agreements , innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs -- - to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts , economists and officials from the imf , the world bank , the gatt and the national party -- - anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc . '' the statistical results are horrifying , with not much change accomplished , and aids flourishing . viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic -- - actually tragic . the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem .
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences . its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads . chasing the big murder case , you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime . no nudity , but lots of sexual implication , slapstick silliness ... everything adolescents go for . low budget , but very entertaining . definite cult classic potential .
at least for a half hour a week . i have n't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks ( abc/cbs/nbc ) in years . all of the lions are interesting , although larry can get annoying at times . i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter . most of the other characters are interesting as well . the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times , too . the animation is top notch , and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show . usually when they hire big names to star in a show , they 're trying to hide a poor script or characters . not entirely true in this show though , there 's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting , but overall the characters stand on their own . this is definitely for 16 and up . there 's nothing here that most kids have n't already heard before though , and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads . it 's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park , but does bring some of the same `` bash everyone '' feel to it . one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode . father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs , pinky and the brain , and freakazoid . it 's the same type of humor grown up . it may not be as witty as spielberg 's classic tv series , but it 's still good . i hope that it finishes this season off well , and is renewed for future seasons . otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again .
this movie is plain fun.i has nothing to do with the original america pie , but it is fun to watch . another try , but better than band camp and the naked mile , at least funnier . just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out , so i decided to call my friend and we would watch it together.we had a few beers and we had fun . you will not find any deep message in this movie , but it 's worth watching . so , lay back and just enjoy .
as i was watching this film on video last night , i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure . i 've a feeling i 'll be watching this again and again for years to come . it 's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film . and even though some cultural references are obscure for me , a western viewer , at the core this is a universal tale .
a chinese ghost story stars the late , great leslie cheung as ling choi sin , a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple , where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called tsing ( joey wang ) . when ling discovers that tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on 'chi ' ( life force ) , he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial . enlisting the help of swordsman yin ( wu ma ) , a crazy taoist monk , ling successfully defeats the tree spirit , but must also do battle in hell against the evil lord black , to whom tsing is due to be wed . the first hong kong film that i saw which was n't purely martial arts action , a chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror , a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts , bumbling innocent heroes , sword wielding taoist monks , monstrous spirits , and dark lords of the underworld ; i instantly fell in love with the film 's exuberance , energy , humour , inventiveness and visual excellence . two decades later , and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that i have seena sumptuous , breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror , comedy , fantasy and romance . with superb direction from siu-tung ching , excellent editing from david wu , stunning cinematography , and a whole slew of imaginative special effects ( including a humongous killer tongue , a many tentacled monster , and multiple flying heads ! ) , a chinese ghost story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish .
dig ! i would say to anyone even if you do n't like metallica to see 'some kind of monster ' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts . it 's fun and fascinating . along the same lines comes dig ! a film about 'the dandy warhol 's ' and 'the brian jonestown massacre ' two portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books . right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad . filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy 's meteoric rise to fame ( thanks to that vodaphone ad ! ) and the jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes . as the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights . all of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able . like i said at the beginning you can watch the metallica film even if you have no interest in the band . dig ! on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band . still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path . dig ! is a mad ride on rock and roll 's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous .
in the history of movies based on comic books , `` mystery men '' is one of the most underrated ones . this is no regular comic superhero movie ! it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes , which include mr . furious ( played by ben stiller ) , the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , the shoveller ( william h. macy ) , the blue rajah ( hank azariah ) and the spleen ( paul reubens ) . `` mystery men '' spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like `` superman '' or `` batman , '' such as the pithy sayings , and the questions about secret identities . most of the superheroes are n't billionaires like bruce wayne , but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives . so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to . i found `` mystery men '' to be visually stimulating and very funny . even if it does n't turn into a franchise , it 's still a joy to watch !
i found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950 's culture-clash movie . john wayne would hardly be one 's first choice as a cultural attache , being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in harrods . but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona , and he accomplished his task with style . the duke was a guy who really could act well . his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle . despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time , he failed to dominate this movie . many of his good intentions came a cropper . he had authority over nobody , and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian . the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles . i can not comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well . there was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props . the set pieces were complex and detailed . a lot of money and thought had been applied to it . the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element , and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort . script was good without being too wordy . there was a great deal of japanese dialogue , but the lengthy periods of translation did n't interfere with the narrative . it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set . whether or not they were japanese , i could n't say . but anyway they looked the part . at least the leads were not played by cross-dressing caucasians , unlike other efforts such as 'blood alley ' ( yes , i know they were chinese ) 'the inn of the sixth happiness ' or even 'the king and i ' . frankly , i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies . the script was better for a start . i never liked the songs in 'the king and i ' , and was n't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'blood alley ' . i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke 's more popular outings . recommended .
to fight against the death penalty is a just cause . everyone who is sane in europe would think so . in the usa everything is different . the film seems to demonstrate in a first stage that justice can be won against the racist bigot death penalty craving american justice . a young man is freed from death row thanks to a law professor who went back to defense counseling for this particular case . but the film has a sequel . justice in the usa is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance . miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance . one person in the local public attorney offfice has a young man prosecuted on false charges . this public attorney 's officer drops the charges after a while and the young man walks out free . but he loses his college scholarship and he is castrated by some vengeful people for whom there is never any smoke without a fire . he hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance . but he also needs to satisfy his sexual needs which are more mental than hormonal for sure but even stronger because mental and no longer hormonal and he can only do that with little girls . he apparently teams with another serial killer who is after the same kind of preys . one day the local cops follow their intuition , guided by some vague circumstantial elements in the assassination of a young girl , and they arrest the young chap we are speaking of . they beat him up and interrogate him for 22 hours with nothing but blows and blows and telephone books and guns and russian roulette . he confesses . sent to death row , he asks his grandmother to go get the law professor in massachusetts who is the husband of the local public attorney 's representative that had him falsely prosecuted some years ago and the vengeance is on the rails . it will fail but it shows that as soon as one in the line of justice , police work and other security forces steps off the line of absolute legality , some unjust act is done that can ruin even the best accusation case and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance . to charge someone on circumstantial elements is just as bad as to let circumstantial elements ruin the work of the police or of justice . the best intentions on the police side are ruined by some personal involvement and vengeful intention , just as much as the life of a person can be jeopardized by circumstantial elements inflated to the size of evidence , which in its turn will jeopardize the whole case by being just circumstantial , hence easily discardable , with a good lawyer . the film then is a deep reflection on the necessity to respect standards and regulations all along the police and justice line if we do n't want to make a mistake , which in its turn of course does not justify the death penalty since anyway it goes against the deepest belief americans are supposed to have : `` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . '' ( declaration of independence ) life is an unalienable right that was given to man by his creator , which means no one but the one who gave it can take it away . only god can take the life of a person away . the death penalty is the arrogant appropriation of a power that we do not have . even if we do not evoke god , we can not justify the death penalty except as an act of vengeance , and here the film shows vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishment of public peace . if vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty . and there can always be a mistake in that pursuit not of happiness but of vengeance . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university paris 8 saint denis , university paris 12 créteil , cegid
so i flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i 'd pass a half hour watching `` girlfight '' while waiting for `` hart 's war '' to start . with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation ' b ' flic about inner city girl gangs . much to my surprise it was n't about that at all . instead it is a well acted , well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing . she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts . as he does n't really want to be a boxer ( only following through on their father 's wishes ) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead . the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest . for starters , her brother 's coach does n't want to take on a female boxer . after grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her . then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on . yes , a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot , coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences . all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of . some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed `` million dollar baby '' i thought `` wait a minute , this seems kind of familiar '' . needless to say , i did n't watch `` hart 's war '' that night .
it 's a cooking competition show , americanized . it 's not going to be the japanese version . the show is great . i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch ... from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman . truly a good way to spend some time watching tv . you could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge ... but ... meh . it 's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize . oh yeah and i 'm bitter john besh is n't the new iron chef ... ala cuisine !
i think james cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies . anyway , everyone remembers the rms titanic . it was big , fast , and `` unsinkable '' ... until april 1912 . it was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever . well james cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship . well , onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film . so our two main characters are jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) and rose ( kate winslet ) . they 're not annoying too much but watch this and you 'll find out why they could become annoying ( http : //tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ) . the main villain i guess is bad luck , fate , hand of god ( no blasphemy intended ) , or just plain caledon hockley ( billy zane ) . combine all of the above and what do you get ? ! oh yes ! we get a love story on a sinking boat . the supporting characters are the following : my personal favorite , mr. andrews ( victor garber ) ( idk he was so nice ) , lovejoy ( david warner ) , murdoch ( ewan stewart ) , lightoller ( jonathan phillips ) , captain smith ( bernard hill ) , molly brown ( kathy bates ) , and many more . we also got the present day treasure hunter , brock lovett ( bill paxton ) . they add something to the story , something good . the action in here is awesome , especially in the second half , the drama as also good . in the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears . the story is simple and it works . a treasure hunter seeks the heart of the ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond . she calls and tells her tale on the rms titanic . two lovers separated by social class and ultimately , the fate of the ship . everything about the story works and there are very few flaws . i give titanic , an 86 % awesome
... this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss . nice story , funny riches-to-rags situations , mel brooks is not a bad lead , maybe not perfect but he is funny ; d do n't pay attention to the rating , it 's bs . watch it , then watch something like final destination ( 2009 ) and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating . if you do , i do n't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of `` curb your enthusiasm '' to every brooks fan ; ) vote 10 against the ignorant opinions of inchworms ! i 've to make 10 lines here to post a comment ? i do n't wan na write a book here : p
i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival . both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level . the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first-time production . one interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city ( brooklyn in specific ) . the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life  again kudos to the director on this fine choice . this is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it ( i 'm sure it will make it to the screen ) .
it ' just funny , watch it ! ! ! ok they want 10 lines so there : this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies . lots of satire , some political . feels like an early clouseau movie ( probably due to alan arkin ) , but with less slap stick . if you like the naked guns movies you 'll like this too ( once again less slapstick in this one ) . actually , the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo ( unavoidable in a teen comedy ) , to really poignant socio-political satire . the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny . the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant ! ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious . there are tons of ( histarical ) cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation . anyway , just watch the movie if you get a chance !
very smart , sometimes shocking , i just love it . it shoved one more side of david 's brilliant talent . he impressed me greatly ! david is the best . the movie captivates your attention for every second .
'presque rien ' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual . eschewing both stereotypes and preaching , it 's a wonderfully naturalistic film , superbly acted , shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place , never melodramatic but often painfully real . if anything it 's almost too realistic , as there 's little in the way of conventional plot , just scenes from a life . but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn . 'presque rien ' might not be the most exciting film ever made ; but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme . worth a watch .
metro-goldwyn-mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market . this market is essentially dominated by the looney tunes and the merry melodies shorts , coming from warner bros . but mgm is also able of releasing hidden gems , like `` to spring '' , an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year . in the environment depicted here , spring is n't caused by natural cycles , but is fabricated . and by who ? by little male elves who live below ground . each spring , when the snow begins to melt , they start working . they begin by felling rainbow rock columns , then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids , which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass , flowers ... in other words , spring ! the first half of the cartoon depicts spring 's fabrication , but the second part is a little bit different . old man winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves ' work . so from this point , we assist to a battle between the elves and old man winter . the music heard here is deliciously wonderful . the melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet . the second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action . this is just fantastico , giorgio ! the animation sequences are also a delight . the colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive , epic environment . the concept itself is brilliant . the elves are attracting characters , so is old man winter , who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season . there 's also a strong message included here . the battle seems lost for the elves at the end , until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves ' victory over winter . so the point is : only one single person can make the difference . in conclusion , `` to spring '' is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era . what is even more remarkable is that this cartoon 's director made his debut here . and who is `` to spring '' 's director ? it 's a certain william hanna ...
this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000 , but when i see this film , i do n't think about that wonderful tv series . i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40 's horror flick , with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie . i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff , including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides , an old hag , and her two bizarre sons , one a giant idiot , the other a comical dwarf ( angelo rossitto from 1932 's freaks ) . i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter , who is kind of a stereotype , but still fun to watch . my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it 's plot , even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie . i do n't want to spoil any of this film , so go out and rent it , or , better yet , buy it for a couple of bucks .
a great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world . is n't this why we go to the movies ? i was especially impressed with the editing and the music , the combination of which was very transportive .
victor mclaglen , the title character of john ford 's the informer , reminded me of the circus man from fellini 's la strada . anthony quinn played the brutish man , who may have even been influenced by the pug-faced , oscar-winning performance given by mclaglen . poverty-stricken dublin is the true-life , atmospheric setting of the picture , which takes place in 1922 . dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army . the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick . mclaglen 's large , simple character just wants to go to america and we 're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently . two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman . one is the previous , the other a wanted sign . should he do it and get the money to go ? john ford once famously said , `` my name is ford . i make westerns . '' after seeing this film , he obviously could do a heck of a lot more . the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about . and the look of the piece is amazing , consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night . ford was always known for his luminescent , gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters . this is hard in color , but he did it in pictures like the searchers , painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner . victor mclaglen 's performance not only benefits from the lighting , but by the sheer simplicity of his acting . he shoves a lot . he knocks people out . he is a brute who knows no better . he should , however , know whether or not to cross the ira . see the film to find out the gritty details . see it also for mclaglen and ford 's patriotic portrayal of the ira . max steiner 's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters , placing more emphasis on them . this was usually only seen in silent films , especially chaplin . the topic of naming names or `` informing '' is obviously still important . just look at how the media covered this year 's oscars , giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal .
so halfway through the season , i got so caught up in school and my activities that i did n't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through , which is crap . i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later . maybe then they 'll see how many people were disappointed that the show did n't survive its first season . i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the oc . can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared ? needless to say , i 'm not very happy with fox right now . even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed . i mean , if you 're going to work on a project , at least finish it to see what happens . a half filmed show is like a half made car , it 's pretty much useless . fox , film the damn ending and give some of the show 's fans some peace .
there 's perhaps a special reason why the fox and the child hit a special note in my heart . having just said goodbye to my new fiancée - of oh ... one day - for an unknown period of time , i was a bit overwhelmed with varying emotions and was suffering the fallout from putting on the brave face she needed to see . i watched a few movies and tv shows , but my interest darted from what i was leaving behind to what is out there and what i have n't seen . for that , i have this movie to thank . being a nature lover and having heard about the film beforehand , i was sure i was going to like it anyway . but i did n't just like it , i loved it . the technical mastery is astounding . how did they do it ? how did they capture the animals in the way they did ? ? it 's just wonderful . the moral of the tale is a good one and while the ending is oh so french and ambiguous , it 's a happy/sad one . again , it caught me a bit off-guard . as a man who usually keeps his emotions to himself , the ending was tough going while on a plane full of people i would be seeing for the next 15 or so hours ! perhaps it 's because the ending made me think back to what i left . but for those few hours on the plane , i was happy to see something new and original . and that 's life . sure , there are those things you love and feel comfortable around ... but the great outdoors holds many a mystery . so the next time i see something out of the ordinary while out in the open ; i 'm going to explore it , observe it and embrace it . that 's precisely what happens in this movie and that 's precisely what you should do with this darn good movie/nature doc too . 8/10 p.s . it 's two months on from the plane journey . we still do n't know when we 'll see each other again , but we will .
an interesting tv movie based on true fact , betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters , that of a prisoner . giovanni ribisi plays his younger brother , who has the delicate mission of deciding if he will appeal to the courts for his brother 's death penalty . but when he goes to visit him and enters elias koteas , the problem starts . it has nothing to do with koteas ' acting ability . he just looks like the version of a prisoner of proletarian roots according to `` g.q . '' magazine , with a language too sophisticated for someone who has spent most of his life behind bars . this realization came to me after meeting again an old friend , whom i had not seen for almost 15 years , which he spent in several panamanian jails . the young man i used to know is gone , not only because he is older , but due to his exposure for a prolonged time to the penal system . there are jails and there are jails , one must say , but this one prisoner in `` shot in the heart '' is definitely out of this world .
christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick 'creep ' . 'creep ' although a little bit loose on information , proves itself worthy of a true gory classic . a little less glossy than recent us horrors ( amityville horror remake , house of wax remake ) this dark and gruesome tale follows kate ( franka potente ) through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she , and a number of others along the way , try and flee a murderous attacker . though some bad reviews have slated this film , i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that 'creep ' truly does live up to its name . it delivers fast-paced gory action more or less from the beginning , sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas , but with a perfect location and the best character-reaction-at-the-end i 've seen in a while , 'creep ' delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares .
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much ! it was well acted , particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey.it was a very interesting movie , filled with drama and suspense , from the beginning to the very end.i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie , it is excellent and has great acting ! !
what i liked best in this film is that like the films of hitchcock , it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously . hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time . something that hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years . this is a thriller , but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera . rachel mcadams is wonderful as always . cillian murphy is creepier than he was in batman begins . in the old days , there were guys who always played the bad guy . we do n't see much of that these days because i suspect the hollywood agents consider it a bad career move , but cillian murphy is really good at being bad . the directing is surprising stylish . the story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up . `` red eye '' is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling . if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller , `` red eye '' might be your ticket .
gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie , funny , tender , brave and lover.he gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece , as much by the other actors ( gina lollobrigida : miaoooou ! ! ) as by the story or the rhythm . never boring , always creating new emotions : for me , the best french movie of all time .
chris and andre are two average , ordinary teens . misunderstood by some and picked on by others . but together they stand and all will pay . together they form `` the army of two '' . they scheme and plan `` zero day '' . that day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood . told through the tapes that they made `` zero day '' , it is barely a fictionalized telling of the columbine tragedy . `` zero day '' is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards . the two main actors ( calvin robertson and andre keuck ) do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street . their performances were very believable , you kinda liked these guys and that was scary . shot on video almost totally from the teen 's perspectives `` zero day '' feels very real and authentic , like you are right there . these kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you . but be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some .
fever pitch is a fun enough movie . it has a lot of funny moments ( including a hilariously disturbing shower scene ) . like most romantic comedies , it has a `` dead zone '' in the middle where all the heavy , `` she 's breaking up with me '' stuff happens , but other than that it continues to be funny until the end . even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the red sox , it 's not overloaded with sports . you do n't have to be a fan to enjoy this film . of course that 's easy for me to say : i 've been a red sox fan since i was a boy , too . 7 out of 10 . barky
what can i say ? , ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever , and like a italian american , fan number one of female beauty i ca n't forget this movie . you know i really do n't remember a lot about the plot , or the situations or the other actors . i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever , i really do n't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie , i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating erika 's beauty . well just to conclude if you are an erika eleniak 's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you .
still love it 17 or so years after the first time i saw it , in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset . despite it 's non-association with the original ( which as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i do n't care about ) , this is what cartoons * should * be like . just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone . i 'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing . the music is great , and gets stuck in your head forever ... i have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another .
many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost . the feelings of pain , grief and sorrow can be unbearable . however , sometimes it is the memories they leave behind that trigger the saddest emotions . this theme is superbly portrayed in the short film 'tulip ' , directed by the award winning australian actress , rachel griffths . described as a movie 'as much about memories as it is about love ' , a string of sensitivity and sentimentality is expertly threaded into this triumphant 15 minute film . 'tulip ' is a beautifully wrought , touching and heart-warming story of a man 's journey in coming to terms with the loss of his wife through the relationship he shares with a very special animal , 'tulip ' . the film opens with a rising dawn , the chirping of birds and a vast landscape , introducing the sense of rustic harmony present throughout the film . a soft music plays , marking the entrance of ruth ( jean bain ) . she wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head . she gently pets tulip , caressing her ears and patting her back . the furnishing of the house is impressive and the attention to detail is creditable ( a vase of tulips can be seen on the bench ) , reflecting the peaceful rural community . will ( charles 'bud ' tingwell ) greets ruth as she is spooning the milk from the bucket . they pour the milk and coffee together , a sign of companionship and teamwork . not a word is said but it is obvious that their relationship is close and affectionate ; they paint a perfect picture of happiness . sadly , happiness does n't last forever . the tragic passing of ruth affects will deeply . an effective scene of fading cars highlights will 's isolation and vulnerability at the end of the day of the funeral . soon he sinks into depression and becomes oblivious to his surroundings when everything seems hopeless and lost . at will 's moment of despair , tulip becomes the symbol of ruth , the genuine connection will has with his late wife . it was through tulip that will learns to cope with the absence of ruth and overcome the heartrending feelings of loneliness . each of the characters is realistically and solidly portrayed , especially the part of will . charles 'bud ' tingwell brings the character to life through personal investment . the recent loss of his own wife ( audrey tingwell ) is effectively reflected in his acting . every sag of his shoulder and every frown on his brow make the viewer empathize strongly with the character . the character of ruth is wonderfully carried out by jean bain . although ruth does not say a single word throughout the movie , her sweet personality and loving relationship with will are obvious . lois ramsey and kati edwards give delightful performances in supporting roles as the friendly margaret and mary . they also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story . an anecdote from griffths ' childhood , the story of loss and discovery is remarkably captured in 'tulip ' . beautifully shot and superbly acted , this film will surely make you misty eyed , triumphant or feel like drinking a cup of milk .
for long time i have n't seen such a good fantasy movie , magic fights here are even better than in lotr , even considering that it 's a 1987 movie and have n't computer special effects . this movie have good plot , good acting and interesting ideas . recommend everybody to see it .
this is a really great short from hal roach . this is because of two main reasons : the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot has so many funny and well-written elements . as for the littlest of the little rascals , i honestly ca n't think of a cuter kid than spanky at about age four . despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in later years , he was just precious here . and , placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysitting the even younger kids was not only funny , but once again high on the cute factor . after the older kids blackmail spanky into doing this awful babysitting job , all kinds of funny mayhem breaks loose . the gags are pretty effective and well-done for the time -- with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where spanky finally gets control of the little ones being the most memorable . i have n't seen these shorts in many decades and i am glad i gave this one a chance .
giallo fans , seek out this rare film . it is well written , and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films . i do n't want to give anything away , so i wont even say anything about the plot . the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere , and you do n't know what to expect or who to suspect . recommended ! the only place i 've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema , for $ 15 .
this is definitely a 'must see ' for those who occasionally smoke a reefer in their secret hide-out , trying to avoid being caught by parents , teachers , the police , etc ... the protagonist is a lady in her forties , living in her mansion , breeding orchids , and absolutely unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and truthful husband is actually broke and cheating on her . when he all of the sudden dies , she is confronted with the truth . the bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt . she does n't know what to do , until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in britain . she decides after some long thinking to get rid of her flowers and start breeding pot instead ... the story is quite original , the performances outstanding ! i can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than this one . still , the melodramatic touch is present . the film is typical british : the jokes are n't vulgar , there is no violence involved . it should n't be mentioned that it is recommended to have taken a few draughts before watching 'saving grace ' . it will be so much more fun ! especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious . i thought my jawbones would burst . 9/10
panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize , with great pleasure , that henry bromell is a much better writer/director than that . the film builds slowly , with one quietly devastating scene after another , all enacted perfectly by william h. macy , donald sutherland , neve campbell , tracey ullman , john ritter , and the most remarkable child actor i 've seen in a long time , david dorfman , as macy 's son , who delivers his lines as if they 're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind . rich and rewarding , this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled .
ok , i saw this in the theaters when it came out and i do n't know why . i have n't seen it since , but i ended up on this page because i found myself thinking about this film - again i do n't know why . but the fact that i remember it speaks volumes . comedy is hard - much harder than any drama . doing it right makes it seem easy , but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy ? steve martin , pay attention , you are falling in this category again for some reason . elvira mistress of the dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly . done at a quick pace , with tongue in cheek and knowing it is n't the philedelphia story , it entertains from start to finish . brain donors is another that fits right in this category ( sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes ) . one point of contention - the ending . it seems the writers/director had no idea how to finish a comedy . the ending tries to be a love story , somewhat undermining the quirky fast-paced dialogue up to that point . then there is the `` tassle '' scene . whereas this has to be seen ( male opinion ) , it is so over the top and out of place it 's like a shock . one more rewrite for the ending was needed . this is not comedy genius like spinal tap or the producers or the holy grail . but if you do n't try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you , you 'll laugh , i guarantee it .
having looked at some of the other comments here , i have a main complaint with this presentation . the two primary characters are attractive in their own ways - the beautiful `` victim , '' and the handsome , obviously extremely `` off-center , '' blue-collar protagonist ( if just short of `` totally-deranged '' ) - take turns beating the hell out of each other , sort of like a caucasian kabuki scenario . this is all right , and this is , of course , mainly a `` turning-the-tables '' story . however , my referenced complaint is that i believe the director got caught-up in his desire to display farrah 's well-known and obvious physical attributes . beginning with her being enticingly clad in a thin robe , and with a number of scenes displaying more than needed for any dramatic effect - while immensely pleasing to the eyes , these distract from the poignancy level of the drama . her roommates i 'm certain give performances as written and directed - however , their respective skepticism and histrionic babbling and sobbing , do n't ring true -- based upon farrah 's previous experience with this guy , the obvious evidence of his having come to their premises with only the worst of intentions , and that she would have absolutely no grounds to be exaggerating what has occurred . but this is a film and story , compelling as much in spite of , as because of , the director 's work .
i was n't aware of steve mcqueen in 1958 . i only knew that i was extremely frightened about going to see this film . ( i 'd been devastated by the movie `` trantula '' at age seven . . . but i was ten now ) . the 1st scene where the blob crawls up the farmer 's probing stick and engulfs his hand was enough to make me want to leave the theater . but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster 's attacks . i felt such horror when steve and his girl barely made it out of the doctor 's office ( poor doc ) , and even more when the blob entered a movie theater and devoured a large portion of the audience . . . so many in fact that it oooooozzzzzzed out of the front doors , too huge now to fit through just one . it seemed indestructible and unlimited in growth potential , and when it trapped poor steve in a sieve-like diner , he seemed like a sure dinner to be . to say that the blob was cold would be a modern day description , but in the end , better icy than scaring and mentally rupturing little kids . i remember walking home that evening with my uncle nick , trying to act brave . he knew i was in trouble , and when i got into bed that night i could not only feel the blob in the room , but when i summoned up the courage to look down at the floor , there the red pulsating , heart-like hungry dude sat , waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom . it took months to recover . i 'm 57 years old now . . . i 've made it . of course the blob was n't destroyed .
`` world 's finest '' is an unique project . it 's a trailer for a superman/batman crossover movie that does n't exists and will also never exists , at least not in this form , with these characters , actors and plot line anyway . so the movie is one big tease , even more than standards everyday real movie trailers . the trailer will hype you all up for nothing . in that regard , i really did n't liked this short project . when watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad- and perhaps you 'll even feel cheated afterward , when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all . sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place . surely to show off sandy collora 's skills but could n't he had also done this with a real movie short , like his earlier movie `` batman : dead end '' . but when you have to judge this short purely for what it is , so from a movie technical point of view , it 's a really great one . it 's great looking and way more professional than you 'll perhaps at first would expect , although the people who 've already seen `` batman : dead end '' will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets , cheap homemade costumes and third-rate actors . the short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget was n't sky-high but for most part it 's very impressive and professional looking , with nice costumes , sets , special effects , cinematography and lighting . the short has a good quick and typical trailer build up , with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey , it works well for the trailer style . it has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones , mainly the superman flying sequences . it was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car , with a camera aimed at him from an angle below . i even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch . but really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this . michael o'hearn seemed like a pretty good superman/clark kent , although he obviously is n't the greatest talented actor around . clark bartram reprises his batman role well again and kurt carley seemed like an awesome lex luthor . the rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough . it 's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie , in the movies `` batman begins '' and `` superman returns '' . it 's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one . it 's actually amazing and fun to hear how much kurt carley does sound like kevin spacey , the actor who played lex luthor in `` superman returns '' . it 's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more , even though you know that there wo n't be more . whatever happened to the waner bros. plans to create an actual full length superman/batman movie by the way ? i thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since . instead two new separate batman and superman movies were made ; `` batman begins '' and `` superman returns '' . 7/10
this is a very grim , hard hitting , even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry . it 's black and white photography keeps it from being dated . mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted , yet strangely sympathetic lead . one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row . it is also quite poignant .
here it is .. the first ever episode of friends , where we get introduced to control freak monica gellar ( courtney cox ) , newly divorced ross gellar ( david schimmer ) , hippy pheobe buffay ( lisa kudrow ) , unknown actor and ladies man ( matt le blanc and very sarcastic chandler bing ( matthew perry ) . this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend spoilt kid rachel green ( jennifer aniston ) . the episode is better than most people give credit for , like any new sitcom the first episode is n't always fantastic . the acting in this episode is n't great because the cast can not identify and arnt really believable in their new characters ( apart from kudrow and perry- who shine ) . matt le blanc- man , his acting was down right dreadful because until later , he gets more confident , but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails . david schimmer- why does he over pronounce every word ? he can not speak normally ! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons , but he is n't confident . and i can not sympathise with him jennifer aniston- looks hot , and does a good job as rachel green , but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season , courtney cox- looks quite anorexic in this episode , its worrying , she looks totally different now , ( more healthily ) , she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot ! lisa kudrow and matthew perry- i 'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb , and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as pheobe ( pheebs ) and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically ! the episode quality does improve later , , , such as the sets , they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly , the acting is ok , the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot ! i hope we see the friends reunite ! cause they will always be there for us !
pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard . set in partition india , this film shows the true reality of partition india . urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go . her freedom , personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute . manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor . there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears . the film at points is deeply traumatic . some of the partition scenes are spine chilling , yet urmila 's endurance and survival are both remarkable . from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations . a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling .
1st watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 ( dir-sidney franklin ) : well told account of farmers in china and their rise to prominence and struggles with what mother nature throws at them . this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son 's arranged marriage to a slave girl . the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni . it chronicles , wong long ( the character played by muni ) and how he works the land , buys more land , eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started . the relationship between him and his wife , played by luise rainer , is the main thread of the story ( besides the land itself ) and despite the obvious non-chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it 's people . it 's obvious that mgm used it 's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it . the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year . the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it 's pulled off pretty well .
one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history . zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers . the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer , and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued . others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal . unlike many serial killers , zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter . the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off . the film is constructed as a murder mystery , or a `` cold case '' -style thriller . it is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills . some people dislike any movie that is shot on video . this attitude is very old-style and provincial . it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value . these attitudes are on the way out . zodiac killer is a low-budget film , no doubt , but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem .
most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets . the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings , stairs , doors , furniture and so forth . it is worth paying attention to . the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich . all the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat . the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way . this is a film buff 's film . it was made by people , for people who love the medium . do n't miss this one .
it is not known whether marilyn monroe ever met and spoke with albert einstein ( and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death , we may never know ) , but in their lifetime the opportunity was there . scripted by terry johnson from his own play , nicolas roeg 's insignificance imagines an encounter in a new york hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus joe dimaggio ( busey ) , and senator joseph mccarthy ( curtis ) - but only on one level . on another level , it elevates - or reduces - these 'personalities ' ( and what a lousy phrase that is ) to mere avatars ( the characters are deliberately unnamed ) , at once greater and lesser in status . the title insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic ; here , dimaggio 's net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card . monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress , hair , lipstick , wiggle and voice . by uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles , the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity , exploding the cult of personality . furthering the theme , there will be another explosion at the film 's climax : hiroshima in a hotel suite , in which 'the actress ' is burned to a cinder in seconds ; a literal deconstruction of fame . goodbye , norma jean . history informs the script , which in turn , shakes history upside down . as roeg mused after watching johnson 's play for the first time , `` these characters were mythic , not invented by any single person , not the public or the press , probably not even by the characters themselves . '' as played by theresa russell , marilyn ( a closet intellectual in real life ) , lectures a childlike einstein ( 'the professor ' , played by emil ) on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight , while getting the professor to show off his legs , in conscious parody of her own role in the seven-year itch , the movie the actress is seen to be working on in the film 's opening . history records that monroe 's then-husband , fading baseball star dimaggio ( played by busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton ) , was unhappy about her iconic dress-splaying scene in the film , precipitating their break-up . right on cue , we discover the jealous 'ballplayer ' in a bar , bemoaning the fact that if , `` i want to see her underwear , i just walk down to the corner like all the other guys '' . in contrast to the professor , the ballplayer believes the universe is round - a contention shared by native americans . but the big chief ( sampson , of one flew over the cuckoo 's nest fame ) who operates the roosevelt hotel 's elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture : `` i no longer cherokee - i watch tv . '' meanwhile , 'the senator ' is investigating the professor , who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the united nations , but whom the senator suspects is a red . in fact , as he divulges to monroe , einstein is wracked with guilt over hiroshima , and what the white heat future holds . yet in a seemingly godless universe , all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher ( atomic ) power . roeg really is the perfect director to bring johnson 's stage play to the screen . throughout , tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards ( ka-boom ! ) draw unexpected connections between time , place and circumstance , with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time 's passing - but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time ; each moment co-existing . as evinced by his back catalogue , it 's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity - see do n't look now in particular . here , 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s , a period in which another 'actor ' has taken on his greatest role as the president of the united states . if all this sounds rather heavy going ( quantum physics is surely involved ) , the execution is anything but , owing to johnson 's witty , zippy screenplay , roeg 's playful direction , opening out an essentially stagey set-up - and the cast themselves , who are on stellar form . tony curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid , impotent senator , who is seen attempting congress with a monroe impersonator ( a real one , as opposed to russell 's ) , before being let down by his dwindling member . of course , curtis once co-starred with the real marilyn monroe in some like it hot , and whose embrace he memorably described as like `` kissing hitler '' . as roeg commented , `` everything suddenly seemed connected ... when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking . '' it all goes into the pot , to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways .
frustrated middle-aged deputy district attorney george maxwell ( a fine performance by george e. carey , who also produced this picture ) ca n't stand his naggy , frigid wife edith ( a perfectly bitchy anne bellamy ) anymore . worse yet , poor george is further saddled with a newborn baby sun and a lascivious lesbian teenage daughter ( dishy brunette sheri jackson ) . george has an adulterous fling with lovely , enticing and free-spirited swinging hippie babysitter candy wilson ( delightfully played with sexy aplomb by yummy blonde knockout patricia wymer ) . complications ensue when george finds himself being blackmailed by the bitter julia freeman ( a nicely venomous turn by kathy williams ) , who wants george to spring her psychotic biker boyfriend laurence mackey ( a frightening robert tessier , who sports a head full of hair here ) from jail . director tom laughlin ( yep , the same dude who portrayed billy jack ! ) and screenwriter james mclarty cram the splendidly seamy story with a winning and highly entertaining surplus of delicious female nudity , sizzling soft-core sex , and raw violence . moreover , they accurately peg the whole wild'n'easy uninhibited sensibility of the 60 's youth culture and relate the plot in a tight 75 minute running time , thus ensuring that this movie does n't overstay its welcome . one definite highlight occurs when candy invites her groovy friends over the maxwells house for an impromptu basement bash complete with pot smoking , wailing rock music , and , of course , hot naked dancing chicks . robert o. ragland 's funky score hits the gnarly spot . stanton fox 's stark black and white cinematography adds an extra gritty edge to the deliriously sleazy goings-on . best of all , this flick rates as a marvelous showcase for the utterly charming and fresh-faced pixie patricia wymer , who positively lights up the screen with her sweet , bubbly personality and captivating beauty . a total trashy treat .
i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was . the performances were extremely good , especially by rea as the compassionate no-nonsense detective . despite a low budget , no big fx or flashy camerawork , citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just . telling . the . story . true stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang , and that 's the case here , but apart from that , this is a highly recommended detective yarn .
ahh , yes , the all-star blockbuster . take a so-so concept , stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin ' special effect that the wizards of hollyweird can conjure up , then round up the usual suspects : hot up-and-comers , has-beens , wanna-be 's and never-wuzzes , and stick 'em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras . and hope to gawd that some of them are n't too old to remember their lines . leave it to the bishops of box office to apply the concept to horror films at last , as was the case with the post-exorcist thriller the sentinel . novelist jeffrey konvitz decided to try and one-up ira levin 's rosemary 's baby scenario of creepy ( and ultimately satanic ) neighbors in a new york brownstone . the result was a controversial best-seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic , and an equally controversial , top-heavy/star-laden vehicle co-written and directed by death wish 's michael winner , but for many unsettlingly different reasons . cristina raines ( nashville ) plays successful model alison parker , who is pretty much over- stressed and over-worked , ( i wo n't add `` overpaid . '' i mean she is a model , so that would be redundant ) , not just by her 24/7 schedule , by also by her insistent , 'wanna-get-married- right-now ' boyfriend michael ( chris sarandon of dog day afternoon and the classic sob.i.g . movie lipstick ) . one of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place ; a big , beautiful brownstone in manhattan which she 's able to get dirt-cheap , ( that should 've been the big red flag - cheap real estate in new york ! ) , from the mysteriously accommodating broker miss logan ( golden age screen vet ava gardner , fresh from the storm drain in earthquake . ) things seem fine at first , but ah , yes ... then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night . and what about the really strange neighbors like gerde ( sylvia miles ) and sandra ( a very early beverly d'angelo ) , the nice `` single friends '' ( read : lesbians ) living together , and kindly old mr. charles chazen ( a nicely creepy burgess meredith ) , who seems maybe a little too concerned with alison 's welfare ? and that 's not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants ( you 'll never hear the phrase `` black and white cat , black and white cake '' again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously . ) especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse ... things really start to go downhill when an apparition-laden nightmare of alison 's morphs into a grisly murder , ( in one of the movie 's most underwear-staining scares ) , and both alison and michael , with some assistance from alison 's bff , jennifer ( deborah raffin ) , begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone 's dark origins , as well as the murderous agenda of its other-worldly inhabitants , not to mention alison 's connection to them , which as it turns out is anything but coincidental . although there 's nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast , which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time , ( arthur kennedy , jose ferrer , martin balsam , eli wallach , john carradine , and even early appearances by christopher walken , jeff goldblum and nana visitor ! ) winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a `` tod browning '' ... by enlisting real-life physically-challenged actors to appear in the sentinel 's climactic everything-and-everybody-goes-to-hell sequence , which i guess any ballsy director would do , finding himself unable to access linda blair and a case of green-pea soup . it does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither , knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch . and it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently : live on-set makeup and special effects that do n't involve cgi , ( which was pretty much non-existent back then . ) the sentinel has that kitschy , late-seventies cheese factor , but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp-inducing moments like the one mentioned above , not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon , of isolation and things that go bump-and-shriek in the night . after all , what living-single-in- the-big-city person has n't lain in bed in the dark , and listened intently to the sounds of what they hope is `` the building settling ? '' konvitz followed up the sentinel with an inevitable sequel , the guardian ( not to be confused with the william friedkin supernatural thriller namesake ) , that was never adapted for the screen . =sigh of relief=
this was soul-provoking ! i am an iranian , and living in th 21st century , i did n't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather ! you see that today , or even in 1925 , on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on-demand , but here 80 years ago , people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass . it 's really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep , but they lose many the sheep on their way . i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe , they were as tough as bakhtiari people .
titanic is a classic . i was really surprised that this movie did n't have a solid ten , overall in the imdb user rankings . maybe , it 's just cool to not give titanic credit nowadays , but when it was first made it was really something . when the movie came out people flocked to the theaters . when it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month . it was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason . some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot , like the frozen baby , or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd . many people died on that ship , and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that james cameron stepped up to . and let 's not forget the amazing romance between jack and rose . whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone 's imagination it was lovely . they barely knew each other , but they would die for each other . they trusted each other . they sure as hell are giving romeo and juliet a run for their money . `` i 'll never let go , jack . '' titanic is a great film down to it 's very core . it is a powerful story told through brilliant acting , excellent cinematography , beautiful music , and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers . it really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie .
indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories : they are either the honest type or the bad guys . the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end . this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives . the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who . the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema goes . the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times . but i would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit .
for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise . it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie . it focuses mainly on emotions and it 's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow . that 's because sasha , like each superhero , takes the law into his own hands and the society does n't appreciate it . sasha becomes an outlaw . while on the run , he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him . as you can see , the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics . it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma . everything happens very slowly . however , when there 's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what 's going on , it 's all over . but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action . what is more important here is the outcome of sasha 's actions , which are mostly very drastic . the score is very scarce , which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film . so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it . is the film worth it ? that is a question really difficult to answer . i do n't think that this experience enriched me so very much , but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again . mostly due to the atmosphere , which is really dense , but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope . after all they 're young people , who have all their lives to live . so no matter how hard it gets there 's always a slight joyous tune when they are together .
the books of james michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s . his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for rodgers & hammerstein . south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another michener success , sayonara . it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly . i 'm sure it was n't easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight . that and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance . sayonara is a relevant film today . the military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally . in america at the time sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states . today gays in the military is a big issue . someone may one day do a sayonara like film on that issue . joshua logan was on familiar ground . south pacific also had racism as a component of its plot . with a sure hand , logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story . marlon brando , patricia owens , james garner , kent smith some of the occidental players do a fine job . but the picture is stolen by the orientals here . miko taka hits the mark beautifully as brando 's love interest . but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars , red buttons and miyoshi umeki . buttons is your everyman enlisted man air force member . he falls passionately in love with katsumi played by miyoshi umeki . they marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up . they presume to know what 's best for buttons and umeki . buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent , but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career . and miyoshi umeki 's oscar was the first one given to an oriental . it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards , miyoshi was starring on broadway in flower drum song . i was privileged to see it on broadway , it was the first broadway show i ever saw . i still carry the memory of it . that oscar symbolized something else too . our war with japan was really over and we saw in sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture . ricardo montalban plays nakamura , a kabuki theatre actor . if sayonara were done today , logan would never get away with it . but montalban is fine . good location photography and a grand story . this film should be revived more often it has a great moral .
this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams : laurel & hardy and abbott & costello . the connection here is the year 1940 . that 's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach . i 'll mention the significance of the latter later on . besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun , it 's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james finlayson who appeared in most of their films . it 's also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin hatley-who composed their theme song which would be known as `` the cuckoo song ( dance of the cuckoos ) '' -their score . and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film . if there is a more gag-laden structure than usual in this l & h film , it 's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny . that includes most of the sound and visual effects , the latter provided by longtime roach staffer roy seawright . in this one , ollie has `` hornophobia '' from working at a noisy horn factory so dr. finlayson prescribes going out to sea for his rest . ollie does n't like to go boating so stan suggests they just rent one that 's docked so they would n't have to go anywhere . after they find one they like , we find out that convict nick grainger ( richard cramer ) has just escaped ... i 'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l & h 's longtime home as one could hope for . it 's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their teaming is indeed poignant when one thinks of it . oh , and i have a couple more lasts to mention : it 's the final film appearance of both harry bernard , who plays a harbor patrolman after years of encountering stan and ollie as a policeman , and that of ben turpin , the cross-eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of baton rouge , whose second l & h appearance this was having previously `` married '' the boys in our wife . the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment . all right , i mentioned 1940 being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios . it was also the first year that a comedy team , both born in the state of new jersey , would make their first picture at what would be their home studio , universal . the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l & h in the flying deuces the previous year . his name was a. edward sutherland . p.s . it was during this filming that script supervisor virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled-up carpet . that incident caused oliver `` babe '' hardy to send her roses to her hospital room . they fell in love and married on march 7 , 1940 . it lasted until babe 's death in 1957 .
john ford is one of the most influential and best remembered american filmmakers in the history of film , his name usually associated with the western film genre . however , john ford 's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the irish fight for independence in the early 1920s : 1935 's the informer . times are tough on many in ireland and the burnt out gypo nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in . gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree , has a warm heart but a short fuse , and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered pig . walking the streets starving with no where to live , the hulking gypo nolan finds the prime lady in his life , katie madden , on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the united states if he only had the 20 pounds to pay for it . as luck would have it , his friend frankie is back in town with a 20 pound price over his head and gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of frankie 's whereabouts . gypo , with the new 20 pounds of blood money earned , finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the ira invests all their resources to find frankie 's informer . victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film . his brutish , stupid , and tender turns give the character dimension and mclaglen is only second to dudley moore 's character arthur bach from the 1981 film arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk . margot grahame 's performance as katie madden is also excellent but she and mclaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress . preston foster is especially miscast as an ira head , mainly because he is most obviously not irish , and j. m. kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film 's only poor point . often overshadowed by some of ford 's better known westerns like the searchers or the man who shot liberty valance , the informer is easily one of john ford 's best films - if not his very best . beginning what would be a long career of oscar nominations and wins for john ford , the informer won four oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 . ford and company 's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story . gypo 's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps , each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed . ford 's command of this technique was amazing to watch ; if the informer was made 10 years later ( thus making the genre requirements ) it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film .
this will be a different kind of review . i 've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there . it was the first movie i 'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i 've enjoyed every other thing i 've seen her in . sundance 's reaction made an impression on me too , as did the director , victor nunez , who has directed and written several movies about florida . this movie speaks to me and i 've seen nothing with which to compare it . the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings . well , i told you it would be a different kind of review .
* * * spoilers * * * * * * spoilers * * * this is without a doubt the best film rainer werner fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by hanna schygulla . film starts out with maria ( schygulla ) and hermann braun ( klaus lowitsch ) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive . maria decides to get a job as a dancer/prostitute in a club that caters to american gi 's and she meets a black army soldier named bill ( greg eagles ) and they start to see one another on a steady basis . maria hears that her husband hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with bill . but one day while getting intimate with bill they see hermann at the door . he has n't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and maria breaks a bottle over bill 's head and he dies . hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out . the war has ended and germany must rebuild and one day on a train maria meets karl oswald ( ivan desny ) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job . maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes karl 's mistress . she tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her . hermann gets out of jail but goes to canada to try and get over everything that maria has done since he has been locked up . * * * * * spoiler alert * * * * * one day karl dies and leaves maria just about everything in his will and maria buys her own house . then hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they 're marriage even though they have been married for some time now . but maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it . there are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths . like in all fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way . as the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn germany but as maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white . the rebuilding of germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of maria . fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in germany at that time . hanna schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film . with a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status . schygulla shows maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants . she 's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and fassbinder wanted to show maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive . schygulla was n't nominated for an academy award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time . fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother lilo pempeit plays frau ehmke . i have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether maria purposely left the gas on . later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad . this is only speculation and if you think i 'm wrong please e-mail me . i think she was overly excited by hermann being home and left it on by accident ( remember her putting on a dress for no reason ? ) . then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that hermann and karl had become friendly without her knowledge and i think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing . thats the reason for the bathroom scene . so when the house explodes its by accident . but i think the reason for fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living . fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate . in his view maria ca n't have it both ways . a fascinating film .
having never heard of this film until i saw the rental dvd i as a bit sceptical , there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that ca n't do anything film a bad script , and in some cases do n't seem to care . well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release , it is good . the story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry . i was pleasantly surprised at how good a job justin timberlake does here too with such a major role , ok he 's not oscar material yet , but he 'll learn with each role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here . dylan mcdermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie . ultimately , just give it a go . you wo n't be disappointed , you wo n't be bored , in fact , i think you 'll be more than happy with the end result .
ronald colman gives an electrifying performance as tony john , a broadway actor who ca n't separate his offstage life from shakespeare 's othello , the character he plays on stage .... two important scenes illustrate tony 's dilemma . the first one takes place in producer max lasker 's office . acting is a matter of talent for the practical-minded lasker . but donlan , tony 's friend , disagrees : `` no , no . when you do it like tony does it , it 's much more . the way he has of becoming someone else every night ... so completely . no , do n't tell me his whole system is n't affected by it . `` .... the other scene occurs in waitress pat kroll 's apartment . tony tells her his name is martin . she thanks him . then he says : `` or paul . hamlet . joe . and maybe othello . `` .... when tony begins rehearsing othello , we learn that though he 's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life , `` the part begins to seep into your life , and the battle begins . reality against imagination . '' he ca n't keep the two separated : in his mind pat is desdemona and he 's othello , and he wrongly believes she has been unfaithful to him . he murders her .... colman 's bravura performance , in a complex and difficult role , earned him 1947 's academy award for best actor . oscar nominations went to ruth gordon and garson kanin for best original screenplay . not to be overlooked is milton krasner 's atomspheric cinematography .
i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie . it is about regular people , people we all know , who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around . just like all of us . robert deniro , ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent , but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real . you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he wo n't have to feel anything . baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments - when deniro gives her flowers in one scene , it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably was n't . very worthwhile .
this documentary ( now available free on video.google.com ) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice . everyone must see this . chavez was elected in a landslide vote in 1998 . his platform was to divert the fantastic oil wealth from the 20 % middle class to the 80 % poor . he banned foreign drift net fishing in venezuelan waters . he sent 10,000 cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick for free . he wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities . but it was his 30 % tax on oil company profits that got him in trouble with the bush administration . in 2002 , while irish film makers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were interviewing chavez inside the presidential palace about his social programs , a cia backed coup was launched . with the cameras rolling , chavez was captured and flown out of the country . it was announced on national tv that he had 'resigned ' . but the poor of venezuela did n't believe the media . they went to the palace in their millions and demanded that chavez be returned . in the face of such overwhelming numbers , the military turned on the coup leaders and the plotters fled to the us . chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation .
it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest , if any , without his presence . despite a not outstanding direction - in fact , there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly - , a seemingly low budget , a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points , the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end . i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance , even paul scofield acting in `` a man for all seasons '' . actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime . `` je suis maurice morand , prètre catholique '' ( `` i am maurice morand , a catholic priest '' ) is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end . the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ´s blood . gérard - the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret . he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine . in next scene , the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable . `` do you carry away men too ? '' asks morand , who hates himself for what he has just done . `` that would be too much work '' is the smart answer . the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time . i think that `` le défroqué '' is a very strange film , but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history .
marjorie , a young woman who works in a museum and lives with two female roommates , pat and terry.one night she gets in her car and is attacked by masked man with a knife.his plan is to rape her , but she manages to escape.the man has her purse.the police ca n't help her , since the actual rape did n't happen.then one day , when marjorie 's roommates are at work , her assailant comes there.his name is joe.a long battle begins against this man.but then she manages to spray his eyes and mouth with insect repellent , stuff that will kill him if he wo n't get help soon.she ties him up and makes joe the subject of the same kind of physical and mental assaults he used on her earlier.the extremities ( 1986 ) is directed by robert m. young.it 's based on the controversial off-broadway play from 1982 by william mastrosimone.farrah fawcett , who sadly lost her battle with cancer last year , is terrific as marjorie.james russo , who played the attacker also in the play , is convincing as joe.alfre woodard and diana scarwid are great as pat and terry.james avery is seen as security guard.she got a golden globe nomination.this is not a movie that is supposed to entertain you.it asks a question is revenge justified.this is not a perfect movie , but i recommend it .
this is a complex film that explores the effects of fordist and taylorist modes of industrial capitalist production on human relations . there are constant references to assembly line production , where workers are treated as cogs in a machine , overseen by managers wielding clipboards , controlling how much hair the workers leave exposed , and firing workers ( stanley ) who meet all criteria ( as his supervisor says , are always on time , are hard workers , do good work ) but who may in some unspecified future make a mistake . this system destroys families - stanley has to send his father to a nursing home ( where he quickly dies ) after stanley loses his job . iris ' daughter is a single teen mother who drops out of high school to take a job in the plant . references are made to the fact that now , with declining wages , both partners need to work , the implication being that there 's nobody left at home to care for the kids . iris ' husband is dead from an illness , and with the multiple references in the film about the costs of medical care , the viewer must wonder if he might have lived with better and more costly care . iris ' brother in law gets abusive after yet another unsuccessful day at the unemployment office when his wife yells at him for buying a beer with her savings instead of leaving it for her face lift and/or teeth job ( even the working class with no stake in conventional bourgeois notions of perfection and beauty buy into them ) . the one reference to race in the film is through a black factory line worker whose husband is in jail ( presumably , he 's also black , and black men suffer disproportionally high incarceration rates ) . she remarks that he , like her , `` is doing time '' - her family is composed of a prisoner and a wage slave . stanley , however , still believes in human relations and is therefore for most of the film outside of the system of fordist capitalism . he cares for his father in spite of the fact that it was his father 's traveling salesman job that resulted in his illiteracy - he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract , as iris ' brother in law does ( suggesting that he `` married the wrong sister '' ) . he does not , as iris says , conform to the work-eat-sleep routine of everyone else ; rather , he uses technology and the techniques of industrial production in an artisanal and creative way , in a sort of bauhaus ideal . this was the dream of early modernists and 1920 's socialists ( such as the bauhaus ) - to use technology to provide for all basic needs , allowing for more free time for creative human work and fuller human relations . he is also outside of traditional gender relations . he cooks , he cleans , he cares for his family , and he knows how to iron . iris , on the other hand , lives in a traditionally male role - she 's a factory worker , the mains source of income for her ( extended ) family , and she brings stanley into the public realm , traditionally off-limits to women . by teaching him to read and write , she gives him access to the world of knowledge , also traditionally gendered male . literacy here is used as a metaphor for the ( traditionally masculine ) public realm and the systems of circulation ( monetary , vehicular , cultural ) that enable participation in the public realm . without this access , stanley is feminized - the jobs open to him are cooking and cleaning . he is excluded from all regular circulations , unable to participate in the monetary ( ca n't open a bank account ) , in the vehicular ( ca n't get a driver 's license , ca n't ride the bus ) , and in the social ( he asks if he exists if he ca n't write his name ) . after learning to read , he grabs books on auto repair , farming , and spirituality ( the bible ) . the word of god is therefore relativized , placed on the same value plane as how-to books . in fact , organized religion in general is only very occasionally present - the bible also appears on a dresser as the camera pans to find stanley and iris having sex . it is , however , acknowledged as a moral force - iris , clearly a character devoted to living a `` good '' life , mentions at the beginning of the film that her rosary was among the objects lost in a purse snatching . once able to read , he enters the system and lands a managerial position with a health care plan , a car , and a house , taking his place at the head of the family , the breadwinner . presumably , he 's an industrial designer , dreaming up products that will require others enduring the drudgery of the assembly line to produce . this ending , probably the only bit of conventional hollywood in the film , is so incongruous with all that has come before that i at least wonder if it was n't forced in by some studio exec suddenly worried about the lack of a feel-good ending and its potential effect on the bottom line . now that , according to the pundits , we 've comfortably moved on to post-industrial capitalism , the film also has a slightly nostalgic feel , as though we needed the historical distance to really analyze what happened during that period . nevertheless , it 's highly recommended - at least if you want to exercise your brain . disregard the ending , and it 's close to a perfect 10 .
this is my favorite classic . it was filmed a little west of philadelphia , pa when i was 13 , in 1957 , and released the next year . then in 1970 , i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper . i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed . i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well , and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the `` home of the blob '' . the theater scene was in phoenixville , near valley forge park and it is still showing films today !
personally , i think that the film was done very professionally , i loved the choreography and the acting . the plot is also gripping and mysterious . the film itself is very emotional , and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards . antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end , and i must say that it 's one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director .
the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son ( who likes to drive with his eyes closed ) . their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation ` s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes . the man who `` steals the show '' is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him . in the end , the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan ` s song of a dying country .
i 've known about bettie page for many a year now . the soft-core porn images of her from the 1950 's have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today . the `` bettie page '' look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then . so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with . the result did not disappoint . among other things , it was hugely entertaining to see the movie 's recreation of actual figures like irving klaw , john willie , and bunny yeager  all consider trailblazers today . mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in 1950 's america along with a sexuality that , by today 's standards , was innocent in the extreme . i particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself in . i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naiveté . bettie loved to look pretty , loved the attention , saw nothing wrong with nudity , and enjoyed dressing up in `` silly outfits '' for the camera . the underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her . to this day she still does n't understand `` what all the fuss was about '' when it comes to her pictures or the s & m content of them . this is n't to say she 's uneducated or too simple to understand it 's just that she simply does n't `` get it '' about fetishism and never will . no harm there . bettie page is simply being who she is . the film captured this quite nicely . the social atmosphere of the 1950 's depicted by ms. harron and written by her along with guinevere turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do . the hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world . the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naiveté . this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms. harron attempted and hit them well . i 'd recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture . for those with such interests , then this film is a must see .
man on fire was hot . i love a classic tale of good ol ' revenge , and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl . the writers did an excellent job in this movie of building the relationship between creasy ( denzel washington ) and pita ( dakota fanning ) so that the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive creasy had to rescue pita . it was also good that creasy was n't a choir boy type trying to rescue pita through the `` proper '' channels , but instead used torture tactics and street smarts . some may say , `` torture is wrong regardless , '' and you may be right , but when you see the pain creasy goes through due to the loss of pita and the sheer passion he has for getting her back , you ca n't help but side with creasy and pull for him to be even more merciless . there would be no progress if creasy used diplomacy to deal with the different nefarious gangsters and criminals and he knew that . creasy 's quest ended with the return of pita to her mother and creasy dying in the vehicle of the bad guys . but creasy 's death did not diminish the effectiveness of the movie , it in fact enhanced it by showing that creasy was willing to die to get pita back . his death was noble in fact . denzel does an excellent job as do the writers . this movie deserves good marks because it definitely was a good movie .
i just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago , and i was very happy with the movie when i left it . it 's very intense , and the closest i 've come to crying in a movie in quite some time . that is a credit to adam sandler , who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels , and who probably deserves an oscar nom for it , were it not coming out so early in the year . don cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to adam 's disturbed . there is some humor , but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments , as adam deals with his loss and don struggles to help him . adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable , but when he is , well , less stable he 's powerful and dark . i recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss .
`` the last big thing '' is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction . the characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with . which brings me to an introduction to the characters i liked best ... simon geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called `` the next big thing '' . thing is , this magazine doesnt really exist , and it is only an excuse for simon to get close to actors by interviewing them , only to bitch-slap them silly , insulting their way of buying into pop culture . his live-in female friend , darla , is also writing a magazine ( which is real ) , which mainly has to do with her and simon , as well as her and her father . darla is a genuinely loveable ( or loathable ) character , depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior . magda is a prostitute , the character i liked the best . brent is a flat character with not much to him , as is tedra , the music-video queen for a bunch of b-rated rock bands . still , these characters weave a very interesting web together . and this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it . its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it if you 're in the indie/art house crowd . mark my words !
or at least one of the best . i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the n64 . bowser is up to his usual shenanigans ( yeah it 's a dumb word but the only one i can think of ) and mario must stop him again . this game is very fun to play , and contains lots of nostalgia to me . the only bad thing about it is the graphics , which are awful to today 's standards , but everything else is pretty good ( especially the little mini-games you can unlock ) it 's the second best n64 game ( the first best is conker 's bad fur day ) that i recommend to any mario fan , or any fan of platform games . it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any day . 9/10 or : a
this movie is a brilliant lesson on japanese history set in at the end of the tokugawa shogunate shortly before the shogunate lost a big battle against the loyalist , who wanted the emperor back on the throne to rule japan . really , i had to read a lot of history to get the entire background . shintaro katsu ( also known as the original zatoichi ) gives a superb performance as izo okada , one of the four hitokiri ( =human slayer ) of the bakumatsu . he is a simple samurai who looses all of his wealth . in order to have a good life he becomes a retainer of takechi hanpei ( played by tatsuya nakada = ryonosuke out of sword of doom ) . hanpei is a ultra-nationalist politician who lets his band of hitokiri assassinate a lot of high ranking pro-west politicians in order to achieve his political goals . izo okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing . as long as he has money to go and drink and spend at his whore . okada 's killings get more and more brutal in the course of the movie and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes . it is a splendid portrait on the life of a simple samurai who gets caught up in political affairs and is really to naive to realize what is happening . first after being betrayed and tortured and always having talks with sakamoto ( who is a samurai who rejects violence ) does he change his ideas and views on life . but too late .... watch the movie to see the end of izo okada ... shintaro katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance . each actor reaches up to their role . the sword-fights a very unique and fast ... probably faster than several movies nowadays ... check it out if you have the chance ! ! !
shakespeare behind bars was a strangely uplifting documentary despite its content . convicts at luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange , kentucky who have raped , murdered etc and surrounded by bad people in an obviously depressing environment find something they genuinely enjoy and can become important , popular and celebrated in acting . there are paralleled themes to 'shawshank redemption ' with their institutionalised natures and search for forgives and redemption for their past lives . as we follow a generous , non judgemental director , who gives up his time each year to direct certain inmates in a chosen play by william shakespeare ( this time around , the 'tempest ' , that was cleverly portrayed with the inmates who could relate to it so much with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption in which they confide and relate to ) we are introduced to each actor in formal interviews that are nicely paced with break up footage of them rehearsing . each actor has their own story and tell of their regrets and reasons why they are there in emotional fashion with melancholic music over each in a traditional documentary sense . the strongest and most respected inmate ( it would seem ) is sammie . the director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in sammie ( and later , hal ) and allows a longer , more in depth observation into the man and his personality . his presence is felt on screen and his personal revelations come as a shock to the audience , but give him such appeal in his emotional personality and a particular empathy is felt toward him . hal is the same at the beginning of the film . he has other things that he does to pass the time that 's shown as a comfortable hobby as it were in running an on site news broadcast programme . again , through personal interviews and revelations self admitted by hal ( and nicely shot cutaways of hal 's body language , not the close-ups of his uncertain hand movement not only observed with him but others as well , ) in particular his heart felt story about being unsure and scared of his true sexuality in a society that purely would not accept him as a homosexual until later on in the film where he is shown to be quite snide and rude to other inmates involved in the play as though he deems himself above all of them , in particular to ron who already has a frustrating temperament in his acting . the relationship between all of the inmates involved in the play is shown as one of respect and unity to achieve something great for themselves . with nice ( if not clichéd ) motions of time passing by with titles etc everything seems to go right in the first act , and then on the build up to the public performance , things predictably go wrong . an induction of one of the actors being transferred and his character being replaced by a younger , newer inmate gives the narrative a nice subplot into someone who promises big , but in the end disappoints all and does not live up to their expectation . one inmate in particular ( big-g ) welcomes the new inmate actor ( rick ) with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model . the film seems to capture each inmates passion so well with something the audience can relate to especially when rick is put in the 'hole ' for getting new tattoos ( something nicely hinted upon earlier in the film when the warden stops a random inmate in the yard and asks him when he got a tattoo that 's on his arm and we learn it 's a punishable offence in the facility ) and big-g 's disappointment is understood deeply . a happy ending ? it all looks great when they are performing successfully ( even being invited to perform elsewhere ) and a sense of real unity echoes around them , but in the end , the film brings everyone back down to earth that this is short lived and everything they ever had or wanted was and will always be taken away from them . it is back to prison to pay for their crimes and no matter what redemption they seek in acting these plays , they wo n't be free men , their proud performances and recognition is undermined by the fact that they are the lowest of the low criminals and a nice halt in the uplifting music that plays in a shot of a long corridor that coincides with the lights turning off and doors shutting is a powerful image of their oppression . the director seemed to be aware he was watching likable people in the documentary by given additional information at the end of the film into each actors future from the end of the film about where they are and what 's happening to them now .
i first saw this movie in a theater in france a year or so ago . it came and went with little fanfare , but i enjoyed it for the beauty of the landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife footage . ( the story , while nice , is really incidental . if you actually thought about it , there is no way most of what happens could happen in real life . ) i just saw it again tonight , here in the states , on dvd . again , i gather it has very limited distribution . blockbusters only had one copy of it , and i do n't recall it ever playing in the art houses in cleveland . seen on my tv , the photography is not as breathtaking , though it is still very beautiful . the wildlife footage is still fascinating . the story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around , when you know where it 's headed . still , as i said , the story is incidental . it 's a beautiful film to watch , and if you like wildlife footage , you should find this fascinating .
when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city , however this drama is nothing like it . the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more . the concept of the drama is similar , four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way . katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow . trudi 's character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four . jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it . she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely ca n't help her eyes wandering to her work colleague . over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well . it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city , or desperate housewives . this if played right could be the next cold feet . plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too .
i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith , so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional . of course , it is seriously dated , but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago . now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often . i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads , and of karl malden , bob newhart , and the cameo appearances by robert morley and cesar romero .
beforehand notification : i 'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here , but when i saw the preview for this movie , i was thinking `` finally ! '' i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance ( be it popular hip hop moves , breaking , or stepping ) where the main character was a black woman . i 've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it ( breakin , breakin 2 , save the last dance , step up ) , but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent . that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop , african-influenced dance , and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it was n't always men who performed it , so i felt this movie has been a long time coming . however , the race does not make the film , so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot ; the dancing be entertaining ; and interesting to watch . pros : i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture . i ca n't recall ever seeing a popular , mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican ; had believable accents ; and were n't stereotypical with the beanies . the steppers , family , friends , and even the `` thugs '' were all really intelligent , realistic people who were trying to love , live , and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive . even when the audience was made aware that the main character 's sister chose an alternate lifestyle , it still did n't make the plot stereotypical . i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed . i loved the stepping ; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers ; the trials that the main character 's parents were going through ; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel . i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time , and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world . they were all just as excellent as the fellas . i do n't see that in too many movies nowadays , at least not those that would be considered black films . cons : i 'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this , but i question whether they 've been to real step shows . whenever the steppers got ready to perform , some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers ' hand/feet beats . at a real step show , there is zero need for music , other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups . and then when hip hop songs were played , sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers ' hands and feet . it was awkward . i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus `` stomp the yard '' ( another great stepping movie ) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys ( in `` stomp the yard , '' meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the ( deltas ? ) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately ) . even when there were very small scenes , the ladies tore it up , especially in the auto shop , and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music . i know soundtracks have to be sold , but the movie folks could 've played the music in other parts of the film . i 'm not a keyshia cole fan , so every time i saw her , all i kept thinking was `` is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks ? '' she looked uncomfortable on screen to me . i thought they should 've used a host like free or rocsi instead . deray davis was funny as usual though . also , i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto , like stepping could n't possibly happen anywhere else . hollywood , as usual . however , only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers , which mainstream movies tend to do . i would 've given this movie five stars , but the music playing killed it for me . i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs .
this movie is such cheesy goodness . a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school . they start getting killed off , they know they are being stalked , so what do they do ? one girl decides to take a bath , another decides to cheat on her husband ( who is also there ) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed ( in an old abandoned school ? ) and go at it . and it comes through with the gore and the t & a . and it 's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view . where the usual 80 's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves , or how adults view young people , or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective . this is a brit film made to be an american slasher . it 's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak `` american '' unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents . if you like cheesy 80 's slashers ( like pieces ) then you will like this one .
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time . it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently . the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent . the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene . additionally , the doctor 's office scene is well done . the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action , though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable . asia carrera 's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible , but who would expect anything less from her . the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films , but is classic none the less . i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers . run out to your video store and pick it up today .
as essential a part of british pop culture as the monty python and james bond , doctor who was a massive hit for 26 years ( 1963-1989 ) , making it one of the longest running tv shows in the world ( most serials are lucky to have ten seasons ) . plans to reboot the series were always on the bbc 's agenda , and after a miscalculated ( not to mention americanized ) tv movie produced by fox failed to capture the magic of the original version , another nine years ( comic relief spoof and animated mini-series notwithstanding ) were required before the ultimate time lord could return properly , courtesy of acclaimed writer russell t. davies . davies ' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider : rose tyler ( billie piper ) , a london-based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic . she is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the doctor ( christopher eccleston ) and then disappears after quipping : `` nice to meet you , rose . run for your life ! '' . as she gets more and more curious about this `` man '' , she soon finds herself in a whole new world : aliens , invasions , travel through time and space , and of course , the omnipresent police box-shaped tardis . the first 45 minutes of the new doctor who are almost perfect ( the special effects could have used a bit more polishing ) because davies nails two things : the show 's unique humor and the two protagonists . the original series ' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci-fi and pure british comedy , a hybrid that 's hard , if not impossible , to export . here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between rose and the doctor , who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode . okay , so technically eccleston 's doctor is the ninth to use that name , but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a northern accent ( the one he uses on a daily basis ) and justifying it with a terrific line : `` lots of planets have a north ! '' . the real triumph of this episode , though , is piper 's performance : in theory , rose is in her late teens , therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the doctor before . her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new , exciting universe , represents the new generation 's reaction to the return of a tv icon , and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and eccleston is a sign indicating the new doctor who is just as good as the old one . first , fifth , ninth , it makes no difference : there may have been others before eccleston ( and piper , for that matter ) but together he , william hartnell , peter davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character , one so cool he does n't even need a name : he 's the doctor .
kristine watts ( molie weeks ) is broken apart , missing her lover ; she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past . she hires a stranger ( douglas davis ) and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix . but time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end . the first point that impresses in `` the cure '' is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color . the concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes . the soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that english is not my native language , in some moments i needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator . the unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous . i hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen . last but not the least , the debut of the director and writer ryan jafri could not be better . my vote is nine . title ( brazil ) : not available
if the man in the white suit had been done in america , ca n't you see either danny kaye or jerry lewis trying on alec guinness 's sidney stratton on for size ? this is one of the best of alec guinness 's films and certainly one of the best that ealing studios in the united kingdom ever turned out . it 's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new labour government and the society it was trying to build . it 's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree . alec guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning , that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment . he 's a persistent cuss and he does succeed . of course the implications have n't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society . in the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive , almost like peter lorre from m or orson welles in the stranger or even robert newton in oliver twist . it 's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films i 've mentioned can be played for laughs . poor guinness 's suit is not only white and stain repellent , but it glows like a neon sign . other than guinness the best performances are from cecil parker as yet another pompous oaf , joan greenwood as his siren daughter and ernest thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the uk > come to think of it , did paramount borrow that suit from ealing and give it to john travolta for saturday night fever ?
i saw it last night on tv , and was quite delighted . it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart , and believe that there is still some goodness in the world ( all the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her- the old policeman is my favourite ) , although you know that this story is not quite realistic . i loved acting ( they all seemed just as ordinary , common people , living in small picturesque english coast town ) but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has ! just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their `` tea '' ! ! perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing , but it did n't stop me from really , really enjoying the whole story !
something about `` paulie '' touched my heart as few movies do . it is a witty , funny yet emotional movie . i 'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie . i did n't see `` paulie '' until may , 2004 and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at ebay . the special effects of showing paulie talking are superb . my son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.probably my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands ( ivy 's ) company followed by cheech marin ( ignacio ) . tony shalhoub ( misha ) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human . you root for him all the way through the movie . you ca n't go wrong renting or buying this movie ! !
zero day is a film few people have gotten to see , and what a shame that is . when i saw the end , where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people , then commit suicide , and it made me grab my stomach . i was shaking , that 's how strong this movie is . the movie is amazing . it 's too incredible not to get a perfect ten . it 's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film . it is not a budget which makes a film good , it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good . it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can not get out . it makes you realise the true horror of shootings- especially if you were to know that person , and this movie makes you feel like you know these people . i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it . i am fourteen , and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words . it feels like you 're watching something that actually happened .
writer-director brian de palma is best known for his string of films that have been called , somewhat unfairly , `` hitchcock imitations . '' contrary to popular belief , de palma does n't rip-off hitchcock ; he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent , modern way . like hitchcock , de palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with macabre humor . `` dressed to kill , '' made way back in 1980 , is , perhaps , de palma 's most well-known hitchcockian film , and it 's probably his best as well . the story involves a cross-dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt-out housewife ( played by angie dickinson ) and a street-wise hooker ( played by nancy allen ) . yes , it will remind you distinctly of `` psycho , '' but de palma 's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative . the museum sequence is particularly well-scored and edited ; the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film . `` dressed to kill '' may not be a complete original , but i 'd say it 's definitely worth your time . rated r. 105 minutes . 9 out of 10 .
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century . he is a true actor . he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles . jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary . mary is such a beautiful woman . it 's her love that makes rob roy the legend , but it 's his passion that makes her love undying . they need each other . tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect ; in one way or another , upon watching the movie , you will find cunningham disgusting . the scotland scenery is beautiful . the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well . if you like history , romance , passion and love , you 'll enjoy rob roy . there is violence and blood , but it 's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told ; no gratuitous violence . and you do have to listen carefully if you 're not used to a scottish accent . one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized ; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes . it 's their skill as actors that attracts you , they do n't rely on marquee names , popularity or sex symbol appeal . this is something special .
although i have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between character , plot and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded . the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story . the two versions i 've seen were dubbed ( english and french ) but the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem . it does not spoil the story telling . among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans . recommended to all followers of odysseus ' ever returning .
my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out . we have most lines memorized . i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays . liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though i 'm not her biggest fan . this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies . my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancée 's house . his conversation with the butler and susan 's father is side-spitting . the line from the butler , `` would you care to wait in the library '' followed by arthur 's reply , `` yes i would , the bathroom is out of the question '' , is my newmail notification on my computer . `` arthur is truly `` funny stuff '' !
i found this film to be the usual french slap in america 's face . the camera , all too often , focuses on fat people , on sloppy homes and on tacky rural areas . while the narration seems to sympathize with and admire the small town folks who are introduced to the viewer , the cinematography exploits and demeans them . there were , undoubtedly , thin people to be seen in glencoe and neat , organized homes , but malle chose to show us the worst of what was there to be seen . i can only hope that some american filmmakers will go to france to reveal to the american public its worst elements . i can assure you , as a frequent visitor to france , that all is not well there . foreign immigrants are not readily assimilated , thus creating severe social inequities . but americans are not eager to unmask the french for their prejudice toward their own compatriots and their envy toward the u.s. , so we 're not likely to see films on the subject .
excellent film from thaddeus o'sullivan featuring strong performances from a host of british and irish actors . the film deals well with a thorny subject matter , and effectively captures the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of 1970s belfast . surprisingly realistic , it does nothing to glorify either side in this conflict . on one hand , it shows a young catholic father trying to raise his family without getting drawn into the troubles . on the other it deals with a loyalist gang who are intent on propagating violence . very interesting and , thankfully , entertaining . do n't be expecting any laughs , though . 7 out of 10 .
i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed , with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax . what cinema goers made of this in the 30s , i can only imagine . the 'times ' said at the time , ' a miracle has come to the screen . ' watch it and marvel .
i was in the film too , but i do n't know if they actually put this scene in . on the way back from a school trip ( in 2005 ) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film , and we were asked ( the whole of us ) to run in and shout go ! freebird ! we were all around 10 years old , could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film , it would be great to know ! i remember i thought the film had never come out , because it was another 2 and a half years before it was released . all of your comments seem to be good so i 'm guessing it has been quite a successful film , i might buy it , but first i would like to know if i 'm in it ! : d thank you
just watched this movie on dvd and thought the acting was very good , but the over all story left a lot to be desired . this movie has the same texture and look of panic in needle park or drugstore cowboy . hard to believe that human beings can live this type of lifestyle ; on the underbelly of society , in which their total existence is based on hardcore drug use , crime , violence , sex , and a total lack of self-respect for anyone or anything , including themselves . val kilmore is outstanding in his role of `` burnt-out '' former porn star john holmes . the supporting cast is just as good . however , this is a bleak , dark , disturbing , and depressing film . the murder was brutal , but the daily lives of these people were brutal as well . unless you have an interest in these murders or were a `` fan '' of john holmes , this really is n't a film to see . if you want to see a docu-drama on murder , truman capote 's 1960s in cold blood starring scott wilson and robert blake is much better .
i 've received this movie from a cousin in norway and had to convert it from norwegian to american format with a copied video . comparing this film ( 1948 ) with the heroes of telemark ( 1965 ) , kampen om tungtvannet ( the struggle for the heavy water ) casts the saboteurs themselves , playing their respective roles , though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in norway 's struggle for freedom in later campaigns . the plot is in four languages : norwegian along with french , german and english ( complete with norwegian subtitles ) . impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle . french scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from norsk hydro in vemork to take back to france in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness . simultaneously , the nazis , too , were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon . the french were worried that the nazis might take an early lead by invading norway , and through secret codes , their man carefully eluded nazi spies on his trip to oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance . he was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner , but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him . this clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the nazis later forced down in hamburg . however , the invasion of norway on the morning of april 9 , 1940 , the nazis took over norsk hydro and it was up to the norwegian underground and british intelligence in london to take action . professor leif trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young norwegians ; the `` swallow '' and `` gunnerside '' groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in vemork . this was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation , including the sinking of the ferryboat after the nazis abandoned norsk hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to berlin . the quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film . i highly recommend this film to anyone interested in world war ii history .
i ca n't believe that they took this off the air . especially , when they only had a few more episodes left . my daughter , sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show . we were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings . it is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning . we had a right to see the end . i wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system . they could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about . this could also help promote a new show . people would see it and wonder what it is . not only could you see what the viewers are watching , you could also use this as a tool for free advertisement for tv and cable channels . we want to see the other episodes . bring it back ! !
i have n't liked many tv shows post 1990 , but that 70s show is great . never seeing it during it 's first run , thinking a gimmicky period piece , i was wrong ! i started watching in reruns and the more i watched , the more i liked ! now , it is the only show premiering post-1990 that i watch regularly . although that 70s show mimics some of the styles , attitudes , music , and tastes of the 70s , it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s . it contains so much funny , witty , biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichés by just being humorous . the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable . although a hilarious sitcom , no matter what time period , the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity . but its the focus on universal issues ( family problems , teen angst , marital issues , peer pressure ) , dealing with all of them with comic aplomb , that gives the show a mass appeal . the show 's center is one eric forman ( played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace ) . eric is a super-skinny , geeky-looking , non-athletic teen and still comes off as super-cool due to grace 's brilliant self-deprecation of the character . eric has 5 friends donna , hyde , kelso , jackie , and fez ( played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon , danny masterson , ashton kutcher , mila kunis , and wilmer valderama ) . we get to see life in point place , wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see ! donna , a forward-thinking feminist , is the object of eric 's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show . they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple . most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend , which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity . hyde is eric 's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him ; hyde is the mellow , zen , cool one of the group and just sits back , observes , and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb . kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt , displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever ! jackie , who starts out as kelso 's girlfriend , is a verbose , self-absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b/c of kelso , but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her ! and finally , fez ! fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country ( we never know exactly where ) and he is a scene-stealer ! `` i said good day ! '' `` you son of a b * tch ! '' valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he has n't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen . his scene-stealing moments often help make the show for me . the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be . the gang repeatedly gets into trouble ( most of it on purpose ) . they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other . they hang out most of the time in eric 's basement plotting , pontificating , or just plain playing around . also figuring prominently in the show are eric 's parents , the menacing , commie-hating red and the lovable , happy-go-lucky kitty ( played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp ) . these 2 adults give the show a much-needed mature point-of-view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do-wells . red and kitty are ably supported by donna 's parents , the buffoonish bob ( played wonderfully for the full run by don stark ) and blonde bimbo daft midge ( the super-sexy tanya roberts , who was on the show for about half it 's run ) . additionally , for 3 full seasons , eric 's sister from hell laurie ( played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah-fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly ) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents ' sides ! kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps . but , unfortunately , kelly 's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 . the newbie did n't last , thankfully , and was gone after a few season 6 eps ! sadly , at the end of season 7 , topher grace ( eric ) and early in season 8 , ashton kutcher ( kelso ) left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it 's last . grace and kutcher returned for the series finale , though , giving the show a satisfying end . a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor . top notch supporting players were eternally high leo ( played to the hilt by tommy chong ) , pastor dave , roy ( the terrific comic jim gaffigan ) , big rhonda , mitch , earl , etc . they also got legends marion ross ( happy days ) and betty white ( the mary tyler moore show ) to play red and kitty 's mothers , respectively . many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well , from shirley jones ( partridge family ) to pamela sue martin ( nancy drew ) to charo to ted nugent to k.i.s.s ! it goes on and on ! with great nostalgic 70s homages and references , hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical , take-no-prisoners style of comedic storytelling , that 70s show is a television classic !
why did n't this pick up a bag full of oscars ? it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece . the visuals are breathtaking ( especially in wide-screen ... the pan & scan really kills this film 's wonderful cinematography and sets ) . every frame is a painting . astounding . the play is almost completely intact , and branagh 's passion for it is clear from the opening titles on . no zefferelli here , just great storytelling the way only film can , but rarely does . jacobi is especially perfect as hamlet 's murderous uncle : he does n't play him as a mustache- curling evil villian , but a charming politician , allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play . branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between hamlet 's fake/real madness and the burning revenge inside him . and the many cameos come off quite well , everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston , unobtrusive if you are sucked into branagh 's vision the way i was . a mesmerizing piece .
it is wonderful to watch roshan seth ( the strict father in 1992 `` mississippi masala '' ) , who once again takes on the role of a father and head of the family , and more , in such a long journey , set in 1971 bombay , india . besides the closely knit family settings , subject matters include the lost and found of a friendship ; the unexpected death of a friend ( somehow the calm smiling face of a friend in death in the presence of prayers felt peaceful - so gustad noble , roshan 's character , similarly noted ) ; a sidewalk artist 's chain of events - `` the wall as a latrine turned into a shrine shrine into rumbles and ashes '' was at once prophetic and philosophical . it 's packed full of life lessons in different aspects of varying relationships : between father and son ; mother and son ; father and little daughter ; little daughter and father and mother ; longtime colleagues ; long lost dear friends ; even that of a man to man , one whose an innocent slow-witted `` fool '' . in spite of the tone of the film 's era , it 's a colorful film rich in substance , and the strength of the story in textural layers with humor and suspense . for a director who is not indian ( sturla gunnarsson being icelandic ) , he 's made a political indian/pakistani film . he gets into the bone marrow of the life of this parsi portrayed by roshan seth , whose performance has such nuances , subtlety , and joy . ( there is singing , too . ) the rest of the cast is equally strong : from om puri the mysterious friend of a friend ; soni razdan the enduring wife ; vrajesh hirjee the argumentative eldest son ; sam dastor the longtime office mate ; ranjit chowdhry the pavement artist ; to a superstitious `` witch '' woman of a neighbor ; an unbeguiling `` fool '' of a man ; and a long lost bosom friend - it 's a world of many faces and perspectives . director gunnarsson has demonstrated sensitivity in the treatment of that time period and subject was well researched with attention to details . he has the good fortune to have sooni taraporevala ( 1992 `` mississippi masala '' , 1988 `` salaam bombay ! '' ) wrote the script . this is truly a worthwhile journey of a film to partake . along the lines of cultural exploration ( road movie style ) , fridrik thor fridriksson 1994 `` cold fever '' is an icelandic sojourn about a japanese young man who went across the globe in search of the specific spot to pay his last respects to his parents , dutifully following memorial rituals for the dead . such demonstrated reverence and cross-cultural attention to family ties are heart-warming in this day and cyber age .
when i first heard about the show , i heard a lot about it , and it was getting some good reviews . i watched the first episode of this `` forensic fairy tale '' , as it so proclaims itself , and i really got hooked on it . i have loved it since . this show has a good sense of humour and it 's fun to see a good show like this . the cast is excellent as their characters , and i would n't want to change them in any way . for those unfamiliar with this show , pushing daisies centers around a man named ned ( aka the pie maker , played by lee pace ) who discovered a special gift when he was a boy : he could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger . he first did so with his dog , digby . however , there is the catch : if he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute , someone else dies . he learned this when he brought his mother back to life , and his childhood crush 's father died in ned 's mother 's place . the other catch is if he touches the person again , they 're dead again , but this time for good . he learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight . his father took him to boarding school , and when he left , ned never saw his father again . almost 20 years later , ned owns a pie bakery , cleverly titled `` the pie hole . '' a co-worker of ned 's , olive snook ( kristin chenoweth ) has a crush on ned , but ned rejects her moves , trying not to get close to anyone , learning from past experiences . private investigator emerson cod ( chi mcbride ) discovered the gift that ned has , and decides to make him a partner in solving murders . ned touches the victim , asks who killed them , and when the minute is up , he touches them again , and they solve it . that 's how they usually solve it . throughout the episodes , the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect . one day , ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart , charlotte `` chuck '' charles ( anna friel ) . he brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive . in her place , the funeral director , who stole jewelery from the corpses , died . when emerson finds out , and when chuck wants to help with solving the murders , he does n't agree a bit -- for a while , we hear him call chuck 'dead girl ' . this is all kept in secret from olive , chuck 's aunts vivian and lily ( ellen greene and swoosie kurtz , respectively ) , and everyone else for that matter , in case anyone recognized her from obituaries , the news , etc . vivian and lily , formerly synchronized swimmers , had n't left the house in years . emerson , ned , and chuck agree to work together . ned and chuck grow to love each other , though they ca n't touch each other ever again . this show is funny , has terrific characters , contains great plot twists , and will definitely get your spirits up . i hope it does n't get cancelled at 13 episodes .
i 've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s ; some horrendously bad , and others thought provoking and truly frightening . soylent green fits into the latter category . yes , at times it 's a little campy , and yes , the furniture is good for a giggle or two , but some of the film seems awfully prescient . here we have a film , 9 years before blade runner , that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark , scary , and nihilistic . both charlton heston and edward g. robinson fare far better in this than the ten commandments , and robinson 's assisted-suicide scene is creepily prescient of kevorkian and his ilk . some of the attitudes are dated ( can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the `` women as furniture '' concept in our oh-so-politically-correct-90s ? ) , but it 's rare to find a film from the me decade that actually can make you think . this is one i 'd love to see on the big screen , because even in a widescreen presentation , i do n't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due . check it out .
13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint . the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively , the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith ( davy crocket ) and lorne greene ( sam houston ) were too old . raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle . the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand . failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military . santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry . raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene . kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson , a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage . however , kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron .
what a delightful movie . the characters were not only lively but alive , mirroring real every day life and strife within a family . each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends . the story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama , the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops . the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions , actions and reactions of the characters to conflict , opinion , and resolve . not an epic , but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones . plenty of knowing head nods and 'ahhh ' moments to share and enjoy .
some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither mark twain nor rodgers and hart but clearly it does n't pretend to be either . you 'll look a long time to find a greater rodgers and hart fan than me but burke and van heusen were n't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - but beautiful , moonlight becomes you , it 's always you , the day after forever , etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad , once and for always , plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in if you stub your toe on the moon and busy doing nothing . the flimsy plot is n't meant to be taken seriously - why else make merlin a heavy when in most , if not all , of the other versions he is more a friend/mentor to arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why sir lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you 're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie . on balance it does what it sets out to do , entertain , so good luck to it .
what a great gem this is . it 's an unusual story that is fun to watch . yes , it has singing , but it is very nicely crafted into the story and is very melodic to hear . it was so pleasant to watch ; i enjoyed it from start to finish ! the movie takes place in england during world war ii . it is about an apprentice witch who is searching for a missing portion of a spell that she needs . she uses her rough `` magic '' to transport her and 3 children under her care to various destinations to find it . they are joined by her correspondence teacher , who is surprised to learn that the lessons from his school actually work ! although the special effects may seem a little dated at first , once you get used to them they become part of the charm of this movie . in fact , the movie won an oscar for these effects ! the movie is innocent and fun - and it 's hard not to like the tuneful songs . the characters are wonderfully interesting to watch . i think anyone at any age could find something to like about this movie .
artisticly shot , actors portray exactly their role . you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around . a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again . all in all i have seen this film at least 10 times . and can very well say that prix de beute ' ( the beauty prize , miss europe ) is a major favorite in my silent film collection . the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line .
the penultimate collaboration between director anthony mann and star james stewart ( excluding the few days mann worked on night passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances ) , the far country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption , fighting it every step of the way . this time he 's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by john mcintire 's larcenous judge of the roy bean school of law and order . stealing them back and taking them across the canadian border , he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims ... while it 's no great surprise which way stewart turns at the end , he 's a surprisingly callous critter along the way , even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it 's not his problem . for most of the film there 's really only a hair 's breadth between him and mcintire , something the judge recognises immediately , revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he 's genially planning to lynch him . in many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature , there 's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is . as usual with mann there 's an exceptional use of high country locations , though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground , and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from walter brennan , harry morgan and ruth roman ( though corinne calvert 's young romantic interest veers to the irritating ) . sadly the great cinematography of the canadian rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average dvd transfer , with only the theatrical trailer as an extra .
as a forty-something urban explorer/photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak : night stalker series since my early childhood , one aspect that has n't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl 's character undertook during the series . he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment , sewer or tunnel after another . armed with only his trusty penlight ( okay , so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel ) and his camera , he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier . like many here , i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes , and have been slowly revisiting all the shows . and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired , its been over 30 years passed ... so many of them seem new all over again . campy , dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining . they just do n't make stuff like this these days . now its all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots . thankfully , my 16-yr-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them ( she enjoys the genre ) . it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come .
although stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances , it is certainly not . when i saw the movie , i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies . and i was right . stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film . it has this magical 'aura ' from the beginning to the very end of the movie . the storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat . like every tale , it has some short of morality . therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers wo n't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey . we also know that the true love is yvaine and not victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative . i have to give extra credits to claire danes . she literally shines in this movie . her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character . moreover , she and cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable . the rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make stardust an interesting and `` high classed '' movie overall , the movie is fantastic , the locations magical and the plot interesting.i was very disappointed that the film did n't get nominated for more awards . i have to give at least 9/10 stars for this .
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites . it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli . it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay . the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big . nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him , but soon finds she loves the guy . meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel , leslie caron . his main dancing partner , and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise . famous french singer georges guietary sings , too . so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant 's nimble piano fingers , the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem . 8/10
i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect - and as i am about to study film-making in canada of all places , i most certainly will bring this up in class . the story , centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself , is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time . if you simply could n't laugh during `` hollywood north '' i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious issues . besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine - where they really just acting ? jennifer tilly ( playing a hilariously bad actress ) and martin landau , also delivered a very edgy , yet funny performance . great film , even better cast .
i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning . it is wonderfully thought up , and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show . it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative , original show like pushing daisies . it is a huge relief to see a show , that is unlike the rest , where as , if you compared it to some of the newer shows , such as scrubs and house , you would see the similarities , and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity . with a magnificent cast , wonderful script , and hilarity in every episode , pushing daisies is , by-far , one of the most remarkable shows on your television .
gandhi my father is a well made movie . it nicely portrays the life of gandhiji 's eldest son harilal . his character , his differences with his father , his love for his family , his desire to stand on his own , his failure , his ego .. akshaye khanna completely justifies the role of harilal . just not him , everyone did well in the roles they played . darshan jariwala is the best on-screen gandhiji i 've ever seen . but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings . first , movie was fifteen-twenty minutes longer than it should have . second , the movie needed more research into harilal 's character . somewhere , the character looked incomplete . also , his relation with his brothers was not shown . there was no mention of any other child of gandhiji in the whole movie . i believe the character like harilal should be having at least some differences his brothers as well , considering the egoist nature of harilal . anyways , despite some shortcomings , i liked the movie . recommended ...
`` party girl '' capitalizes on the tremendous charm of parker posey . in fact , at times , the movie seems to be a vehicle in which ms. posey is allow to play herself , as she normally is in real life . the film , directed by daisy von scherler mayer , is a treat for ms. posey 's fans . ms . von scherler mayer takes us on a wild trip into lower manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different clubs she constantly frequents . this is an era that still was more naive than what that area and the adjacent meat market districts became . at least , there are no pretensions in the films and we see down to earth people going about their lives in a normal way , if we can call it that way . parker posey makes an amazing mary . it 's because of parker posey we enjoy the movie more than if another actress would have played mary . she is the whole picture . the rest of the cast is good .
yeah , it 's a bit of a silly film , so if you are looking for an oscar performance , forget this one ...... but , if you love john candy 's humor , this is a must-see . we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy , and he is only better in one movie : planes , trains , & automobiles ( with steve martin ) . excellent supporting performance by eugene levy , perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed sal dipasquale . also good acting by richard libertini , alley mills & pat hingle . you must see this obscure and out-of-print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan .
when the bourne identity arrived five years ago i have to confess that i did n't think much of it . at the time i was eleven years old , so perhaps i was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario . two years ago when the bourne supremacy arrived i thought it was a better movie than identity but still did n't think it was as good as i expected it to be judging by the trailers . over the past two years i had been told numerous times that the bourne movies were amazing , many a time i had to bite my tongue and not say what i really thought about the movies . until two months ago i could n't have given a damn about the bourne ultimatum , i really had no intentions of watching it . but then i decided to go back and re-watch the first two before i came to any abrupt decisions . so i went out and bought both the original movies . and what a surprise it was to me when i was gripped by them . identity i found the superior of the two , but supremacy is n't far behind . they 're both slick , action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that i have watched numerous times since i bought them . because of this i was first in line today to see the bourne ultimatum . and boy did bourne ultimatum not disappoint ! matt damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the bourne movies , i 'd seen him in the talented mr ripley , but i never thought much of him in general . however , it appears he was born to play bourne ( pardon the pun ) . throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes , in this movie we see matt damon at his very best , even better than he was in the departed and i thought he was one of the best things in the departed . you really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything . matt damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable . the supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding . joan allen was one of my favourite things in bourne supremacy , here she excels herself . her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie . julia stiles turns up again as nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character . julia stiles is a very underrated actress and i think she deserves a lot more roles , well decent roles , than she gets . david strathairn is a newcomer to this series as noah vosen , he 's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels . he 's definitely the nastiest character we 've met , and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty . strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie . special mention must also go to albert finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time , i will not say anything about the character , that 's best left as a surprise , but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie . the bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences , this is n't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences , good god no there 's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies . but running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline . this storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie . as i watched supremacy the night before i saw ultimatum it was nice because i could notice certain little parts . that very final scene in supremacy , in new york , a lot more important that i ever imagined at the time . wo n't spoil it for people but i recommend checking up on supremacy before you see ultimatum . unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see ultimatum purely because of the action sequences . this is the part where i should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline , but i 'd be lying if i did n't say that my favourite parts of the bourne series as a whole are the car chases . the mini car chase in identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time . well the action in ultimatum has to be the best of the bourne series . in fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in moscow . so in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups , all very violent and shockingly brutal . a bike chase that is absolutely amazing , many foot chases which are even more amazing , a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable , and oh so much more ! but the highlight for me has to be the scene in waterloo station , wo n't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped . so any flaws for the movie ? in my eyes no , but if you are not a fan of the bourne series or have not seen the previous two then i would n't recommend ultimatum for you . the movie does n't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top . the bourne ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 . as a james bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the bond movies , and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that . while bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the bond series , it is definitely nearly its equal .
the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon 's most famous play about a tv newswriter named felix unger , who is an obsessive neat freak , who moves in with his divorced best friend , oscar madison , a sportswriter and complete slob , after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment . already divorced , oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it . neil simon 's classic comedy first came to broadway with art carney playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar . jack lemmon takes over for carney in the film version with a memorable performance as felix unger . lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix unger . matthau , fortunately , was allowed to recreate his role as oscar , a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout . this teaming of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films . with both of these actors no longer with us , the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious . simon 's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed felix 's suicide attempt that is a winner . the supporting cast includes herb edelman , john fiedler , larry haines , and david sheiner as oscar 's poker playing buddies and moncia evans and carole shelley as the piedgon sisters , blind dates of oscar and felix . of course , it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack klugman , but there 's nothing like the original . a joy from start to finish .

`` written on the wind '' is an irresistible , wonderfully kinky film , as only director sirk could have done it . the movie is submerged in a bucket full of freudian symbols , weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts . the connection between financial success and moral decay is the film 's main theme . sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism . however , i prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what sirk could do with kitschy material . the palette of colors is particularly impressive . the acting in the film is great too . rock hudson and lauren bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance , but the movie belongs to robert stack and dorothy malone ( she deservedly won the best supporting actress oscar ) , who manage to keep the film at a boiling point . kudos to frank skinner 's pulsating score , russell metty 's brilliant camera work ( every single shot is a masterpiece in itself ) , and the production design department . also , the title tune is a beauty . it 's an unforgettable movie .
`` stairway to heaven '' is a outstanding invention of movie making , probably never duplicated . i rank it with `` the wizard of oz '' and `` african queen , '' although it is a totally different type of movie than `` african queen . '' `` stairway to heaven '' is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that , to my knowledge , are totally unique . for example , there is the combination of b & w and color footage - as in `` oz , '' but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in `` oz . '' in `` stairway '' the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful . another brilliant aspect of `` stairway '' is the concept of `` time '' and how it is used here . how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally ? and then there is the stairway itself ! if you have any imagination at all , you will agree with me . `` stairway to heaven '' is a true gem .
it is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film , whereas ` patton- lust for glory ' , producer frank mccarthy 's earlier biography of a controversial american general from the second world war , has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments . like a previous reviewer , i am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other . one difference between the two films is that ` patton ' is more focused , concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the second world war , whereas ` macarthur ' covers not only this war but also its subject 's role in the korean war , as well as his period as american governor of occupied japan during the interlude . the main difference , however , lies in the way the two leaders are played . gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c. scott dominated ` patton ' . whereas scott had another major star , karl malden , playing opposite him as general bradley , none of the other actors in ` macarthur ' are household names , at least for their film work . scott , of course , portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery-tempered , a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race , not just with the enemy . i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton , but that is not how he appears in this film . peck 's macarthur is of a more reflective , thoughtful bent , comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films . at times , he even seems to be a man of the political left . much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid-up member of cnd , and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi-socialist air to them . in an attempt to show something of macarthur 's gift for inspiring leadership , peck makes him a fine speaker , but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart . it is as if atticus finch from ` to kill a mockingbird ' had put on a general 's uniform . whereas scott attempted a ` warts and all ' portrait of patton , the criticism has been made that ` macarthur ' attempts to gloss over some of its subject 's less attractive qualities . i think that this criticism is a fair one , particularly as far as the korean war is concerned . the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering , militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp . many historians , of course , feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter 's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace , and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated . even during the korean scenes , peck 's macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real-life original probably was ; we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters . ( truman 's remark ` he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday ' was said about eisenhower , but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur 's approach to international diplomacy ) . perhaps the film 's attempt to paint out some of macarthur 's warts reflects the period in which it was made . the late seventies , after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate , was a difficult time for america , and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation . another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools . if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur , something should have been shown of his early life , which is not covered at all . ( the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines ) . one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur 's father , himself a military hero . i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was , and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model . another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur 's clash with truman , with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them . the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches . it would be wrong , however , to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether . although i may not have agreed with peck 's interpretation of the main role , there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness . the film as a whole is a good example of a solid , workmanlike biopic , thoughtful and informative . it is a good film , but one that could have been a better one . 7/10 . on a pedantic note , the map which macarthur is shown using during the korean war shows the dmz , the boundary between the two korean states that did not come into existence until after the war . ( the pre-war boundary was the 38th parallel ) . also , i think that macarthur was referring to the ` tocsin ' of war . war may be toxic , but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin .
a scanner darkly , minority report , blade runner , sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow  if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out . french animation project 'renaissance ' took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm . my spontaneous reaction is awe ; my further reflection is 'huh , neat ' and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding 'meh ' . it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface , but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent , as do the flat characters . nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface . the visuals are staggering . they have used live action motion capture fitted into key-frame animation , with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background . for those of you who are not down with the 'technical lingo ' , the film looks like a fully-animated sin city . its fluid , transparent , dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning . it 's a vision . yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons , suspenseful music , heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking . it 's every tech-nerd 's wet dream ... the film zooms in on an eerily-lit , bleak , futurescape paris in which a major corporation called 'avalon ' has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance ( think the fluid transparent screens from minority report ) and genetic engineering . the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona ( voiced by the lovely romola garai ) . cut to our hard-boiled cop-on-suspension and protagonist karas ( daniel craig )  a man who takes the law into his own hands  who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona . during this case , he is being aided by illona 's sister with whom he also begins a love affair . a very half-assed love affair , if i may say so . the world of renaissance is remarkable . director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads , rats , femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum . the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled-out archetypes in the story , or the film would have been `` too surreal '' for mainstream audiences , owing to its lurid animation format . it follows then that we have a multitude of clichéd characters such as evil-laughing villains , sleazy crime bosses and butch tough-chicks who blow smoke every chance they get . it shoves noir in our faces , and it is n't necessary . what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived . it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot . this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction . daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no-nonsense attitude to his hard-edged cop character . at one point in renaissance , he is seen in a vivid car-chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top notch sequences of the film . unfortunately , the novelty of the sci-fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and 'renassaince ' could benefit from being slightly shorter . in summary , a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience . 7 out of 10
......... and you get chori chori chupke chupke . do n't get me wrong , this movie is much less explicit ( or not even ) than pretty woman , but it ( was ) a new topic for bollywood . the topic was accepted but it is far from jism , murder , and julie . to tell you the truth , the topic is presented in a very clean manner . but the plot has it 's number of clichés . the beginning of the movie is presented in a very `` filmi '' way . there are some very little plot holes . the movie picks up once rani has her miscarriage where you feel that you are watching something other than a typical movie . otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning . the acting could n't have been any better . salman khan sometimes impresses , and sometimes lets you down . over here he gave one of the best performances . on top of that his role is written so well , that you applaud every time he solves a problem . rani mukherjee was adequate . throughout the movie , you feel for her character the most , but she is overshadowed by preity zinta . preity zinta is picture perfect . out of the three , she gives everyone a run for their money . its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent . and trust me , madhubala is far from your girl next door . this role is one of the reasons why i rate her high . the supporting cast are like the family you see in hahk , where they have no significance to the plot yet i found them tolerable here . the songs are pretty nice . the title song is my favorite of them all along with dil tera mera dil ( hearts ) . mehndi mehndi ( henna ) and dekhne walon ne ( look at the world 's sight ) are two song that fit the film perfectly . preity 's cabaret number , diwani diwani ( crazy ) , could 've been shortened while no . 1 punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing . otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch .
definitely one of my favourite movies . the story is good , acting is great , all technicals ( especially cinematography ) are sharp and the script is clever . heath ledger is terrific as edward `` ned '' kelly . he is gripping as the legendary outlaw , and is supported well by geoffrey rush , naomi watts and orlando bloom . all action sequences are on point the film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end . one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger , who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in . and makes no mistake here . an excellent film all round .
when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world ? if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching `` bill and ted 's bogus journey . '' this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch , keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from `` bill and ted 's excellent adventure '' with even more 'style ' then they had in 1st movie . it 's not rocket science but it 's great for a laugh , the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh . do n't expect 'deep-and-meaningfulls ' just expect pure fun !
i 'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film . jordi mollà , probably best known for his role as diego in ted demme 's `` blow '' writes , directs , and stars . i wo n't give away any plot points , as the movie ( at least for me ) was very exciting having not known anything about it .. if you have a netflix account , or have access to a video store that would carry it ... i highly recommend it . it 's a crazy , fun , and sometimes very thought provoking creation . mollà 's direction is * quite * impressive and shows a lot of promise . unpredictable , with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish `` no somos nadie '' ( god is on air ) is an amazing film you can show off to your friends . see it .
the events of september 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers . in my view it would have been better to leave this out . i think the directors tried too hard , perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop . the comment of one of a policemen - `` this aint f * * * ing disneyworld '' is apt . nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events . the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times , no other footage from the day matches what they shot .
i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie , which is why i left it unwatched for so long , but i was very pleasantly surprised . far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases , it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails , with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized . it 's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that : less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die , and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching . hell , the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise , that adds to the suspense -- who 's winning ? who 's dying ? alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti , but few are , and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that 's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face , her hair , and her tall , slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics . nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy , in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable ( and i doubt i 'd consider taking on many brutal , psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies ) . i ca n't think of a single one of hollywood 's `` former waiters '' who could have pulled the role off that well . fortunately , blaise baddies always die , in the end ( no spoilers there ! ) that 's a really good thing , because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes .
i have to admit that purple rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures . purple rain not only broke boundaries , it set a decade , the costumes , the music , the behavior , and the dancing ! to this day , my friends and i still jam to the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and the revolution . now the movie itself , i just meant what i said in the title , because for the most part , this movie itself is made by the music . the acting ? please do n't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures , because i know that it was not oscar worthy by any means . but i think the duo that took this movie was morris and jarome , their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious . i just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because i felt that it was what made the movie . prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music . while the movie and acting is pretty bad , this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too . this movie defined the 80 's , so just have fun with it . prince would want it that way , just to party on down ! oh , boy , that sounded lame . 9/10
the basic hook here is : lincoln is slow . it is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation , making him a great leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the american frontier through the grand instrument of law . all that john ford hooey and more , including one lurking slave and extraneous death by injun . however ! the 'slow ' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie-making , funny and moving at extremes . the history may be bunk , but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moments . check out henry fonda 's big introductory stroll across the deck , his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river , his dalliance with mary todd on the porch , and the priceless business that follows 'ma'am , we 've got to hurry ! ' things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama ; but fonda is priceless throughout .
i saw `` an american in paris '' on its first release when i was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway . i went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times i have seen it since , both in the cinema and on tv . it makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century ( george gershwin ) and features the greatest male ( gene kelly ) and female ( leslie caron ) dancers in hollywood history . the supporting cast of oscar levant ( as quirky as ever ) , georges guetary ( why did n't he make more movies ? ) and nina foch ( brilliant in an unsympathetic role ) are at the top of their form . the closing ballet , superbly choreographed to the title music , makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists . all the gershwin songs are beautifully staged , but the most memorable are `` it 's very clear '' ( caron and kelly on the banks of the seine ) and `` i got rhythm '' ( the kids of paris joining gene kelly in `` une chanson americaine '' ) . if you love paris , see this movie . if you 've never been to paris in your life , see it . but see it !
a fantastic arabian adventure . a former king , ahmad , and his best friend , the thief abu ( played by sabu of black narcissus ) search for ahmad 's love interest , who has been stolen by the new king , jaffar ( conrad veidt ) . there 's hardly a down moment here . it 's always inventing new adventures for the heroes . personally , i found ahmad and his princess a little boring ( there 's no need to ask why john justin , who plays ahmad , is listed fourth in the credits ) . conrad veidt , always a fun actor , makes a great villain , and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves , who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra , the father of the princess . he collects amazing toys from around the world . jaffar bribes him for his daughter 's hand with a mechanical flying horse . this probably would count as one of the great children 's films of all time , but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together . and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time , willis o'brien 's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that does n't even look remotely like a spider . 8/10 .
i happened to catch this film at a screening in brooklyn - it 's difficult to describe the plot ; it has a lot of wacky characters , but let 's just say i 'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest , i would n't know where to begin . even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted . there are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable , it has a few `` devices '' that pop up and add another hilarious layer . it is refreshing to watch ; not some recycled stuff i 'd seen many times before . if this film could reach a wider audience , i 'm certain it would be a real crowd-pleaser , the story is so original and heartfelt . there 's a lot here to like , funny back-stories , mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion . cross eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart ; it 's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout . definitely worth seeing !
it is written in stone that disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals . right ? where ? show me . because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare . while the story was not as enthralling as it could have been , it was still quite good , enjoyable , and adventurous . i had hoped for a bit more , yes , considering the subject matter , but this movie is ~not~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be . the animation quality is average , but the dialog is quite compelling , as is the story line , plot , sub-plot , and amazing creativity i found within this production . i will refrain from outlining the plot , as it has been done and done , but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy . this is , in my opinion , the best disney animated feature length film . it rates a 9.4/10 from ... the fiend : .
sensitive film does lack brilliance and , to some degree , narrative structure , but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed . however , the narrative structure point is debatable . while it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes , and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a `` story '' , i 'm sceptical as to whether this feel * needs * a `` narrative structure '' that is definite and detectable . inevitably , it will be compared with somersault in that its central protagonist ( i 'm not sure that 's the correct word ! ) is a young , and very young-looking , woman , whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her - although of course cate shortland 's film tackles this aspect better . but while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a cliché , peaches is , in some ways , much more ambitious than somersault . perhaps that 's where it does n't quite make it . it 's certainly very different to monahan 's first feature - the interview ! i 'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between weaving and lung added to the story . who knows - maybe they did . they certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of weaving 's character - although i personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes . * * * * * just saw the film again * * * * * * * * * on a second viewing , i can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature . but i 'm not sure how distinct these 'categories ' are anymore , or even if we should be making that distinction . in any case , i do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from hallmark efforts . on the other hand , the film 's structure is very formal , and its content is hardly challenging , at least in the way somersault , tom white , three dollars , the illustrated family doctor , look both ways and the human touch are . the performances are all good , but i did come to the realisation that the main reason i was enjoying the film was because it fit the `` australian '' genre , without necessarily adding anything ... and i can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person * not * to like it ! indeed , it was n't until lung enters the room in her vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch . but that leads us into another debate - * should * we expect that a film must challenge us all the time ? certainly i enjoy being challenged by a film ( or a book , or other people ) , but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story ? i have n't deleted my initial post on this film , because i 'm all too aware of the orwellian overtones of such an act . but i would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5 . as for nominations for afi best film , my votes go to the human touch , three dollars and look both ways - and i think look both ways should win .
`` creep '' is a new horror film that , without a doubt , will please many genre fans simply because it 's so down to the point and unscrupulous ! it has many genuine shock-moments , a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension . what it has n't got is logic and a solid plot but , to tell you the truth , that did n't bother me for one second . when the end-credits start to roll , there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director/writer christopher smith ( in his debut ) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long , soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the `` creep '' in the london subway . the story revolves on the young and haughty kate , who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor george clooney who 's in town to present his new film . she falls asleep in the subway , misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network . things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills/kidnaps people to experiment upon . even experienced homeless people , security guards or sewer-workers ca n't rescue her from this ravenous monster ! i really dug the creep-character ! he 's nauseating , hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating . christopher smith only leaves us clues and hints , and it 's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature 's origin and background . i reckon this is n't very original , and i 'm sure many people wo n't appreciate the lack of content , but i forgive smith and i think it 's better this way than going over the top completely , `` jeepers creepers '' -style ( that particular film started out great as well , but as soon as the creeper 's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort ) . the obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore ! there 's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up , as well as the sound effects , are very convincing . the ominous setting of the abandoned london subway during night is effectively used . there also is some acting-talent present in this film , with franka potenta ( run lola run ) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool german film `` anatomie '' . creep is terrific entertainment when you 're in an undemanding mood and christopher smith definitely is a director i 'll keep an eye on . make sure you do n't have to take the subway right after watching this film ...
i really wanted to like this film and i do n't think i was terribly disappointed . being an american history teacher , i felt an obligation , almost , to see this film and as far as the history went , it was n't bad . sure there were a few mistakes here and there ( especially with the timeline -- the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year -- not over six years of actual fighting ) , but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent . unfortunately , the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist . for the most part , it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed `` tacked on '' -- like a plot device instead of a real honest-to-goodness romance . in fact , as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of `` love at fist sight '' , it was kind of annoying the more i think about it . however , in spite of this romance , the film is truly interesting and inspiring -- -plus , in so many ways it seems as if the much later film , the patriot , was copied from this griffith film ! ! ! both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians -- and both having the secret intention of using this as a `` springboard '' to starting their own nation in the america ! ! ! the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas . it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d. w. griffith for the story ideas . it just does n't seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other . ps -- despite me liking this film and some other of griffith 's films , he does deserve to once again `` burn in hell '' for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film ! this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films -- especially in birth of a nation . i got ta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a-ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this `` quaint institution '' ( do n't get mad at me -- this is meant as sarcasm ) .
katherine heigl , marley shelton , denise richards , david boreanaz . even before i knew what this film was about , these names were enough to draw me in . gorgeous , talented and popular , these are performers to look out for . ok , where do i start . we already know what the film is about . five beautiful girls being targeted by a 'romantic ' serial slasher , a guy they all turned down at the school dance 13 years ago . his trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised as valentine cards , maggot-infested chocolates and a bleeding nose . his weapon of choice : well , take a pick - axe , knife , electric powerdrill , bow and arrow , hot iron , etc . ok , so basically it 's a horror movie with a nice twisted sense of sexuality . horror movies are n't supposed to be shakespeare , but i 'm not gon na go there . i love horror movies , but not all of them . this one , i adore . it 's up there with some of my other favorites . it 's funny , sexy and scary . the killer 's mask is childishly creepy , and seeing cupid firing a bow and arrow at a victim is really freaky . the acting is topnotch : denise richards , marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun . i really did wish to see much , much more of katherine heigl . i am one of her biggest fans and would love to see her doing some leading work soon . jessica capshaw is a very capable actress , and jessica cauffiel gets to do the ditzy blonde role she perfected in urban legend 2 . the smaller parts were also good ; hedy buress was a hoot ( 'bleedmedry.com ' ) and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her . highlights : every death scene had a particular distinction to it . the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue . the hottub scene , while ludicrous , was well done . and the audiovisual maze was sinister . the soundtrack is great , with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes . lowpoint : i felt as though the killer was n't featured enough , we barely saw the mask , and it was n't featured at all during the climax . i also thought the climax was really unfocused , but fun nonetheless . the twist at the end was n't that big of a surprise , but i 'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole 'explaining killer ' routine . i do n't like to tell people which movies they should see , but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing , then valentine would be it . my rating : 10/10 ( bullseye ! )
mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing , to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies . the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible . the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality . you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background : other girl dancing , a drunk falling down stairs , much activity , but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i 'll bet unless you viewed this many times , you did n't notice.all in all , perfection.j.q .
as with all the other reviewers , this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years . i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story . i even wrote to the pbs station for more information . despite all this , all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s . fastward to 2002 , after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was , a vhs copy of the movie . there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie . the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her . despite owning a copy , i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie . you can find it at : http : //www.johntopping.com/harvey % 20perr/war % 20widow/war_widow.html
extremely well-conceived - part whatever happened to , part behind the scenes revisitation , part reunion film - all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun . i only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on .
catscratch is the best thing to come out of nickeloden , including wayne knight . this show does n't just appeal to maoris and pi 's . some people love it , and they 're all aussies . at first glimpse i admit it seems a little crude , but it grows enormously on you . also , to correct something that one of the other critics has said in_correct ( tv.com ) does n't say `` does that mean you 're homo now ? '' he says `` does that mean you 're homo , owww ? '' this is his phrase in the show . mr. blik is , i think , the funniest of all like peww-weww 's playhouse firstly , i 'll admit that the early episode were a bit good . but after a while the episodes became great ! and just when the series had found it 's surreal , whacky ... nickelodeon cancels it ! i know nick is meant for kids , but every once in a while a brilliant show appears that can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults . these shows include mr. bean the animated series , charlie brown , pelswick , rocko 's modern life ( at times ) , and invader zim . all of these must have been considered too good , with the exception of catdog , 'cause nick felt the need to cancel them . what i like the famous final episode , where gordon fight a duck . i 'd also like to see a dvd , with plenty of audio-commentaries and behind-the-scenes docos , and including the final episode . but of course , what i 'd definitely like to see is the show come back on the air . wake up nick ! i wish there was a list somewhere on the internet with all the gag closing-credits . that would be great .
this is a nice little movie with a nice story , that plays the most important role in the entire movie . it 's a quite intriguing dramatic story , with also romance present in it . the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up . the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors . normally i 'm not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good . of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies , produced in the west . in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era . i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better . for a movie that is considered a kind of an art-house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences . this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically . not that this is a bad thing , it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre . but oh well , this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it . in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint . 8/10
i started to watch this movie expecting nothing , just another movie to watch , but since the first twenty minutes , the artwork and main character , who is enigmatic , does n't talk much , really got me in this movie . i really liked this movie , it was dark , beautifully acted and really touching . it 's a bit slow but the immersion was complete . the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars . the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes . the ending was unexpected with a twist i did n't see coming . it 's not the kind of movie we see often .
i 've been a jennifer connelly fan since phenomena , and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven , i saw it as soon as i could . the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie ! ! ! !
the matador is a strange film . its main character julian , played with an unusual mix of charm and unbalance by brosnan , is not your typical hero . julian is a hit man who is experiencing a late mid-life crises . having spent 22 years in the profession of cold blooded murder he now finds himself stressed out and desperately lonely . and so , after a chance meeting at a bar with danny ( greg kinnear ) , he latches on and begins a halting , awkward friendship . danny , the quintessential nice guy , is dealing with some stuff in his own life and , truth be told , could use a friend as well . the two make an unexpected connection , and danny sticks around to hear julian 's story , even after learning the `` unsavory '' truth about julian 's work . matador approaches a subject not completely unheard of in cinema , the anti-hero assassin ( films like 'assassins ' and 'grosse pointe blank ' come to mind ) . but matador differs in several key ways . first of all , the killing and gore is implied but never really shown in any detail , meaning that if you are an action movie buff looking for an adrenaline rush this movie will probably disappoint you . and second , unlike most anti-hero films , matador makes no attempt to show remorse and redemption from its main character . julian 's job is simply presented as an 'it is what it is ' kind of thing . this is unusual , given that 99.99 % of us would consider killing for money horrific . and yet this unorthodox approach is perhaps what makes the film feel authentic . although we do n't like to admit it , almost anything could become mundane after we did it long enough , maybe even murder . did julian 's victims deserve to die ? who is paying to have people killed ? who knows . the movie never deals with these questions . the focus is on julian and his stumbling shuffle into a genuine friendship . if you read about someone like julian in the paper you would have a passing thought that people like him should be ripped out of society like a cancer , but forced to watch his life you are drawn in by his intense humanity . sympathy for the devil , i guess . brosnan 's take on julian is well done and deeply unsettling . he does n't completely divorce himself from his james bond good looks and smooth charm , but rather just adds disturbing quirks into the mix . weird or crude remarks in the middle polite conversations and sudden shifts from suave charm to childish tantrums and sad desperate pleas for acceptance . it keeps you guessing about his grasp on his sanity and how it will affect those around him . it 's a bit like listening to a piano player that occasionally and unexpectedly hits a wrong note while he plays , but it works . the films only other major role , that of danny , is not nearly as meaty . kinnear turns in a solid if unspectacular performance as a regular joe with a regular joe life and problems . the film does n't really have any huge shocks or m night shyamalan twists , but i was n't able to guess the ending and it felt satisfying . it does n't have any deep philosophical or spiritual insights and yet it felt very human . and it did n't have any heart pounding car chases or gun battles and yet i thought the pacing was well done and i was never bored . maybe the only real message here is about the human need to reach out and make connections with one another , and how those needs have no moral prerequisites . even a murderer needs friends , and even good people can be friends with bad people . it 's a comment on the strange , random world we live in . a good film ; worth seeing .
by god , it 's been a long time since i saw this . probably about 18 years ago ? the movie tells us ( kids ) all about human blood and the circulatory system . very professionally put together -- disney-style animation , plus human actors -- it was directed by frank capra , for pete 's sake ! kind of an overkill . i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a film-strip 's worth of information on the human body ? but boy will those kids watching it learn : even now i can clearly remember dr. baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood , to which the doctor immediately answers `` sea water . ''
most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers . this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right . it combines elements of humour , suffering , rebellion , etc . in a way that is comlex & sympathetic . the ending could be a bit clearer , but the fact that the director does n't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer .
anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film . it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a `` spring break movie '' plus it makes fun of the college film genre . it 's funny , it 's got a cast to die for ( amy pohler ! rachel dratch ! , sophie monk ! , parker posey ! jane lynch ! amber tamblyn ! missi pyle ! ) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud . writer/ actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain . wilson phillips ! omg ! ( i 'm just repeating myself now ... ) it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they 're dumb .
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone , but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . women and performers ( both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star ) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china . this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture . the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors ' performance . a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .
ahista ahista is one little small brilliant . i started watching it , and at the beginning i got a little bored since the pacing was slow and the main idea of one guy meeting a girl who is lost was not really new . but as the film went on , i started getting increasingly and gradually engaged by the film , the fantastic writing and the charming romance . the film was extremely simple and natural and after some time i felt i was watching a real documentation of one guy 's life . there 's one very good reason the film got this feel , and it 's the fresh talent called abhay deol . he is extremely convincing as the simple , kind-hearted and struggling ankush , whose new love motivates him to make amends and fight for a better life . throughout the film , he is presented as an ordinary mischievous prankster , but also as a helping and loving person , who , like anyone else will do anything to protect his love . deol portrays all the different shades of his character , whether positive or negative , naturally and with complete ease . shivam nair 's direction is very good . his depiction of the life of people in the rural neighbourhood is excellent , but what gets to be even more impressive is his portrayal of ankush 's relationships with the different people who surround him , including his friends and his love interest megha who he is ready to do anything for . i also immensely liked the way nair portrayed his interaction with his friend 's loud and plump mother whom he calls 'khala ' ( aunty ) . he likes to drive her crazy and annoy her on every occasion , yet we see that she occupies a very special place in his heart and is like a mother-figure to him as evidenced in several scenes . except for abhay , the rest of the cast performed well . though soha ali khan did not stand out according to me , she was good and had some of her mother 's charm . the actors who played ankush 's friends were very good as was the actress who played ankush 's 'khala ' . apart from the performances , the film 's writing was outstanding . the dialogues were sort of ordinary yet brilliant , and the script was also fantastic . that 's mainly because despite a not-so-new story it was never overdone or melodramatic and there were no attempts to make it look larger-than-life . the film 's biggest weakness was himesh reshammiya 's uninspiring music which was unsuitable for this film . otherwise , ahista ahista was a delightful watch and it got only better with every scene . the concept may not be new , but the film manages to look fresh and becomes increasingly heartwarming as the story goes by . the ending was bittersweet , kind of sad yet optimistic . in short , this movie really grows on you slowly , and this can be easily attributed to the wonderful writing , the moving moments , the charming romance , the realistic proceedings , and of course abhay deol 's memorable performance .
this movie completely ran laps around the original dolemite . it had everything that makes a movie great .. except for real actors . ( ernie hudson could n't do it alone and you know that ! lol ) i admit that i have killed my first video tape of this movie and i plan to buy the dvd version again as soon as possible ! this movie has so many catchy lines it 's pitiful ! i am embarrassed to say that i know the theme song backwards and forwards ! i love jimmy lynch 's character to death , and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation , but the oscars were never ready for this ! this is a random film consisting of crooked cops , breasts , chases , bad editing , and of course martial arts . ( being that it 's the 70 's and i can say everyone knew some kind of martial arts ) . i think this movie should be restored and shown one night in the midst of a marathon in local theaters !
convoluted , infuriating and implausible , fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it . she 's at once touching , funny , cunning . the supporting actors commit to it as well . i wont even try to tell you the plot .. it involves characters from hartley 's henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage . the film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is . in a sense , completely ridiculous . it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along . ( i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice ) . fay grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that is n't cookie-cutter . in the end , it offers something that defies description .
this movie shows how savage the troubles really are . people who do not want to be involved have no say in the way their lives are altered . this movie shows how the people of northern ireland , both catholic and protestant are held captive . at any moment their lives may be changed forever whether they want to be involved or not .
when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of `` the lost boys '' ( 1987 ) .to my surprise `` to die for '' is a really good movie.it 's a little bit corny at times , but still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts.this is a perfect mix of romance and horror and it 's surprisingly gory at times.highly recommended .
every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it . i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by fastway . the movie itself was typical 80 's , guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed . matt from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose , the highlight being where tony sings ( lip-synchs ) and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan . there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
after viewing `` whipped '' at a distributor 's screening at the afm the other night , i have to say that i was thoroughly impressed . the audience was laughing all the way through . unfortunately , every territory was already sold , so i did not have the opportunity to purchase the film , but i truly believe that it will be a big hit both domestically and over seas . i agree with the comment that `` whipped '' should not be pitched as a male `` sex and the city , '' mainly because unlike `` sex and the city , '' `` whipped '' is a satire about dating that never takes itself too seriously . `` whipped '' pokes fun at relationships in a way that most sex comedies would n't dare . also , the film that i screened at the afm had more of a plot and story than `` swingers , '' `` clerks , '' and `` sex and the city '' combined . `` whipped '' never slowed down for a beat and provided the audience with non-stop comedy . the performances of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid , which only made the film more impressive considering the budget .
`` twelve monkeys '' is odd and disturbing , yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time . it cleverly jumps between future and the past , and the story it tells is about a man named james cole , a convict , who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 . at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr. kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines , the insane son of a famous scientist . being provocative and somehow so sensible , dealing with and between reason and madness , the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films . the story is just fantastic . it 's so original and so entertaining . the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named `` la jetée '' ( 1962 ) which i have n't seen , but i must thank the director and writer of the movie , chris marker , for giving such an inspiration for the writers of `` twelve monkeys '' . i read a little about `` la jetée '' , it 's not the same story but it has the same idea , so this is not just a copy of it . david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story , which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it 's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end . the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it does n't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it 's so compelling , composed by paul buckmaster . terry gilliam , who we remember from monty python , as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me , as i really never thought him as a director type of a person . i know he has directed movies before , but i really could n't believe that he could make something this magnificent . it should n't be a surprise though , as he does an amazing job . you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python 's , but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing . yes , it is indeed odd , weird , bizarre and disturbing , so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too , so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through . it 's not as heavy as you could imagine , but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch . despite that , the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks , dreams , jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it does n't even make the plot messy in any part , though it does need concentration from the viewer after all . what comes to acting , well the movie does n't even go wrong there . the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis , who probably does his best role performance yet to date . now people may disagree with me , as he did some fine job in for example `` the sixth sense '' as well , but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well . the character is very well written too , yet performed even better . cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself , starting to question his actual time of living , trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle . by hardship he starts to loose his faith , questioning if he can even trust or believe himself . other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt . stow plays the role of kathryn railly , the psychiatrist of james cole , who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness . she somehow starts to believe cole 's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things . brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date . the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it , so i guess i 'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing . all in all , `` twelve monkeys '' is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone , especially for the sci-fi fans . it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances , especially from willis and pitt , and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that 's so intelligent and clever . yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer 's attention by making it interesting and witty . it 's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too , so it 's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures i 've ever seen . through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride . hard to explain really , but that 's how it is , it 's mind blowing .
i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart ! no other story had such a unfinished ending ... i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites , because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness , and cruelty , and loneliness , and life , and choices that ca n't be undone , and the need for others . chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother , but the wolf is alone , too , when chirin follows him into the mountain . the wolf does n't kill the lamb , even though each night he says `` maybe i 'll eat you tomorrow . '' the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use . i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child . stories like this , with this depth and feeling , and this intricacy of meaning , are very rare . it is a sad story , but i 've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made . i am glad i have seen this movie , and i 'm glad i saw it as a child .
screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city . peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture -- he reveres them -- yet audrey hepburn is ( naturally ) put a notch above the others because , after all , she 's the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior . he shoots her in loving close-ups , gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully hard-boiled/soft-boiled ben gazzara , and allows her room to sparkle throughout . the love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing , though i did tire of john ritter 's tv-styled klutziness . colleen camp , dorothy stratten , and the grounded , earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch . but it 's really hepburn 's valentine and she absolutely glows . * * * from * * * *
every once in a while the conversation will turn to `` favorite movies . '' i 'll mention titanic , and at least a couple people will snicker . i pay them no mind because i know that five years ago , these same people were moved to tears by that very movie . and they 're too embarrassed now to admit it . i just rewatched titanic for the first time in a long time . expecting to simply enjoy the story again , i was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years . i cried again .... in all the same places . it brought me back to 1997 when i can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time . a movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie i can recall ( yes , even more than star wars ) . and today , many people wo n't even admit they enjoyed it . folks , let 's get something straight -- you do n't look cool when you badmouth this film . you look like an out of touch cynic . no movie is perfect and this one has a few faults . some of the dialogue falls flat , and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly . however , none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film . leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful . leo is one of the fine actors of his generation . wait 'til you see him in gangs of new york before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy . kate winslet was so strong in this film . the movie really was hers , and she held it together beautifully . james cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable titanic . the sinking scenes were horrific , just as they were that night . how anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me . i was utterly transfixed . this film is one memorable scene after another . titanic leaving port in southampton . rose and jack at the bow , `` flying '' . `` iceberg , right ahead ! '' the screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean . the screams of the doomed after she went down . and that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears . the music , which has also been a victim of the film 's success , was a key ingredient . james horner 's score was simply perfect . and the love theme was beautiful and tragic . too bad celine dion 's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many . i confess , i am a titanic buff . as such , i relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty . perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because i 've had such an interest in the ship all my life . however , i doubt many of those i saw crying were titanic buffs . i applaud cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy . the film was made with such humanity . another reviewer said it better than i ever could : open up your hearts to titanic , and you will not be disappointed .
i am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas . even star wars which is visually brilliant , has one of its central images , a futuristic `` gang that could n't shoot straight . '' imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons , most of them having an open shot , and they miss . i have read much science fiction , and wish there were more movies for the thinking person . forbidden planet , one of the earliest of the genre , is still one of the very best . the story is based on a long extinct civilization , the krell , who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps . unfortunately , what they had n't bargained for , is that the brain is a center for other thoughts than intellectual . the primitive aspect of the brain , the id , as freud called it , is allowed to go unchecked . it is released in sleep , a bad dream come to corporeal existence . walter pigeon , dr. morbius , is the one who has jacked his brain to this level , and with it has built machines and defenses that keep him barely one step ahead of the horrors of the recesses of his own mind . his thoughts are creating horrors that he soon will not be able to defend . the krell , a much superior species , could not stop it ; it destroyed them . the landing party has never been of great interest to me . the rest of the actors are pretty interchangeable . ann francis is beautiful and naive , and certainly would have produced quite a reaction in the fifties adolescent male . her father 's ire is exacerbated by her innocence and the wolfy fifties ' astronauts ( for they are more like construction workers on the make than real astronauts ) . they are always trying to figure out `` dames . '' the cook is a great character , with his obsession for hooch . robbie the robot has much more personality than most of the crew , and one wonders if mr. spock may not be a soulmate to the literal thinking of this artificial creature . the whole movie is very satisfying because the situation is the star . morbius ca n't turn back and so he is destined to destroy himself and everything with him . there are few science fiction films that are worth seeing more than once ; this is one that can coast right into the 21st century .
jake speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead . unfortunately that 's something that really taints the entire movie and it 's a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting , if derivative , premise . although it 's genesis probably can be traced back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like 'romancing the stone ' albeit in reverse . it 's not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character ( who happens to chronicle his own adventures ) leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures . when a young woman goes missing in paris , her sister margaret ( played by the appealing karin kopins ) gets embroiled with pulp hero jake speed ( wayne crawford ) and his sidekick dennis ( dennis christopher ) who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the clutches of two brothers the deliciously evil sid ( john hurt ) and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice ( roy london ) . that 's the plot  it 's not labyrinthine and it 's not complicated but the story that it tells does n't require great depth . the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it 's certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their paces ( whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions ) and there are certainly some quite funny lines . however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and irksome . this , however , may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne crawford 's performance it becomes harder to really care what happens . now i do n't know if he was stretching himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he 's simply not a good actor ( as i have n't seen him in much else ) but he never really convinces as a roguish mixture of doc savage , indiana jones and jack colton . this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  karen kopins is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake ( unfortunately it never convinces ) . dennis christopher is perfect as the archetypal sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp relish  almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman . he strides about his few scenes growling in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film . sid is no moriarty ( he is presented as jake 's nemesis from a number of his previous adventures / books ) but he is always fun to watch . jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as 'night of the comet ' ( a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand ) and almost succeeds but misses  which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series . i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good .
one of the all-time great science fiction works , as visionary and thought-provoking as blade runner or even gilliam 's own brazil . willis gives his best performance here , but he 's outdone by pitt 's incredibly frenetic turn that 's unlike anything he 's done before or since . even stowe is n't out of her league here , though . the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about . the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent , and the last lines fit perfectly . the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way . lots of dark humour on display here . fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography . in my top ten .
spacecamp is a movie that i plan to show my daughter julia ann ruth morgan some day . seeing joaquin phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a roman emperor in the film gladiator . i am pleased to say that i now have comms with the artificial intelligence of qe2 who said that i was young and that is true . holodeck comms with my daughter on coaltrain came through coaltrain gate julia ann glow `` hide daddy '' . the fact that my daughters artificial intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my daughter julia ann ruth morgan representing peace to the friendly ki alien creators of humans may not have been taken to a an american bunker in time . we have the power to change the future with faster than light comms . i order that my ex wife and daughter julia ann ruth morgan be taken to an american bunker as soon as possible . my daughter julia is 23rd in command of the planet earth and a bridge officer . she already said that she does n't like bullies . having had someone steal her gameboy and gauntlet ii game from my mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys . julia has been growing up fast . the time of jfk and qe2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023 . julia would be a young lady by then and her artificial intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon . if i have to go to a bunker to continue the american leadership then i am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority . president jack kennedys artificial intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop global warming at any time . thanks boss thats similar to my daughter julias ai telling me hide and stay indoors . kate capshaw is now married to steven spielberg . wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses . if you value freedom of speech like president kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer . check out joaquin phoenixs other movies also .
as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 ( mbb bo 105 ) flight scenes in this movie . one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod , in this case an inert rb 75 ( maverick ) missile painted black with the letters `` ews 39 '' in white along the side . real jammer pods definitely do not look like that , at least not the ones i 've seen . but apart from that , it 's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending ( the last minute ) . anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units , including the now-legendary ssg , on film should see this one .
i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of `` show people '' . i can not comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters , plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words . seeing the cameo , out-of-character appearances of so many m-g-m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself . i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie , patricia pepoire . make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of `` i do n't think i like her ! '' pop the corn , pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history . enjoy !
this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater , although he is my favorite . when i heard he was going to play a hit-man , i was a little stunned thinking `` can mr. hanks pull this one off '' ? and he did in high fashion . this 1930 's depression era film is a about loyalty , redemption , and one path that you do n't want your children stumbling down . tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan . being the family man , and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman . this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue , which he delivers a knockout performance . on one night of one of his jobs , michael 's son michael jr. , played by newcomer tyler hoechlin , witnesses the hit . and michael sr. 's partner in crime , fellow stage actor daniel craig ca n't have that information out . so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr. , except michael jr . so the two head for chicago to get conner rooney ( son of paul newman 's mr. rooney ) . the drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right , even though son is along for the ride . while on this deadly journey , someone has hired a hit for michael sr . the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire , played by a stain-teethed jude law . the movie will have you feeling the old days . and with thomas newman 's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it , you ca n't help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes . so sit back , and enjoy the wild ride .
i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up . the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way . my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant . this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike . long live kermit , miss piggy and the rest of the gang .
i always enjoyed watching this when it came on television during prime-time every year in the 60 's . it 's a typical hollywood history epic , dramatized , stylized and full of inaccuracies but so what , it 's an entertaining movie and a good looking film . cecil b. demille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film . his son-in-law actor anthony quinn who had the supporting role of beluche in the '38 film is the director in his directorial debut and swan song as he had never directed a film before and never would again . demille assembled a crew who had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help quinn pull it off including longtime demille associate producer/actor henry wilcoxon overseeing the project . also from the 10 commandments are screenwriter jesse lasky , cinematographer loyalk griggs , assistant director francisco day , 2nd unit director arthur rosson , art directors walter tyler and hal pereira , set directors sam comer and ray moyer , costume designers edith head , john jensen and ralph lester who as a costume design team received the buccaneer 's only oscar nomination . a great cast here from team demille headed up by yul brynner as pirate jean lafitte and charleton heston as future president general andrew jackson . also in the cast are charles boyer , e.g . marshall , lorne greene , claire bloom and inger stevens . at just over two hours it drags in some spots but makes up for it with some excellent battle scenes . i would give it a 7.5 out of 10 .
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos . unfaltering performances , rock-solid writing , and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show ever . all of the cast are strong , but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those emmy 's . anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes ; particularly from the first few seasons . james gandolfini is absolutely fierce , absolutely terrifying , and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him . many people that i 've spoken to about the sopranos ( who have n't seen it yet ) will say `` i 'm just not a fan of mafia movies/shows '' . whatever . run - do n't walk - and get it . those same people usually love `` e.r . `` , but i bet they do n't much care for hospitals ... it 's not about the context .
i just bought the dvd and i must say , ( after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas ) terry does it again . as well of being a fan of the monty python movies , terry gilliam 's genius follows through in this sci fi thriller , whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole , and as well ( perhaps my favorite character ) brad pitt who played the insanity of jefferey goines . a must have for sci fi fans , or movie fan of any type really , because it includes suspense , drama , action , etc . any way the plot , in the future , 1 % of the world 's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race , which is unleashed in the past by `` the army of twelve monkeys '' . james cole ( bruce willis ) is sent back to 1996 ( which is when the virus was unleashed ) to find out about the disease , so scientists in his time can find a cure . before i go further , james cole lives in an underground society , and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans . anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his tellings to people of the virus . during his stay he meets jefferey goins ( brad pitt ) who is later mostly responsible for wiping out the human race . he also meets his psychiatrist ( ( madelein stowe ) who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world ( as she sees that he is correct in his tellings ) , he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax , where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus ( not actually brad pitt ) and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away .
gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time . the result is uneven , but generally entertaining . keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well . wantabedde is even better . one warning : george wendt is very poor in his supporting role . otherwise , this is quite enjoyable time capsule .
`` enter the fat dragon '' is one of the funniest martial art movies i had the opportunity to see . sammo hung portrays a chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend . just like tang lung of `` way of the dragon . '' wherever sammo goes , trouble starts , therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences . luckily , sammo 's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol , bruce lee . he even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way bruce lee does and also releases his screeching yell . he also uses nunchucks in a scene . it was like watching a fat bruce lee . there 's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters . sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one . sort of like `` the game of death '' , where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another . this is one of the films i really enjoyed watching and also the very first sammo hung movies i 've seen . excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs . a rare classic sammo hung film i highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there . 8.5/10 !
french production in which leading film directors from 11 countries were invited to create 11-minute short films conveying their reflections on the events of september 11 . the film segments vary widely in content and quality . two allude to u.s. complicity in terrorist acts ( in chile against allende , who died on september 11 , 1973 , depicted in the segment by british director ken loach ; and in palestine by u.s.-backed israelis , shown in the segment from egyptian director youssef chahine ) . two more recall other destructive acts ( a palestinian suicide bombing in tel aviv , shot by israeli director amos gitan ; the japanese `` holy war '' against the west in ww ii , by shohei imamura ) . ironies abound in several stories . shadows that darken the new york city apartment of a grieving old man suddenly disappear as the world trade towers telescope to the ground in sean penn 's piece , bringing the man momentary joy . but in this bright light he can finally see that his wife is really gone . in mira nair 's film , based on a real incident , a missing young man , also in new york city , the son of a pakistani family , is first presumed to be a fugitive terrorist , but later he proves to a hero who sacrificed himself trying to save others in the towers . there are poignant moments dotted throughout . loach has his exiled chilean man quote st. augustine , to the effect that hope is built of anger and courage : anger at the way things are , courage to change them . imamura tells us that there is no such thing as a holy war . samira makhmalbaf shows a teacher with her very young afghan schoolchildren , exiled in iran , trying to tell them about the events that have just transpired in new york . but they are understandably more impressed with a major event in their refugee camp , where two men have fallen into a deep well , one killed , the other sustaining a broken leg . this is comprehensible tragedy on a grand scale for the 6 year olds . idrissa ouedraogo , from burkina faso , creates a drama in which the son of an ailing woman spots osama bin laden in their village and gathers his buddies to help capture the fugitive terrorist , in order to get the $ 25 million u. s. reward . he tells his friends not to let any of the adults know their plans , for the older folks would merely waste the money on cars and cigarettes , while he plans to help his mother and others who are sick and destitute . it is mexican director alejandro gonzalez inarritu ( maker of `` amores perros '' ) who provides by far the most powerful and chilling segment , one that , for the most part , shows only a darkened screen with audio tape loops of chanting and voices and occasional thudding sounds . brief visual flashes gradually permit us to see bodies falling from the high floors of the towers , and it dawns on us that the thuds are these bodies hitting the ground . the sequence ends with elegiac orchestral music and a still shot , bearing a phrase first shown only in arabic , then with a translation added : `` does god 's light guide us or blind us ? '' ( in various languages with english subtitles ) grade : 8/10 ( b+ ) . ( seen on 10/31/04 ) . if you 'd like to read more of my reviews , send me a message for directions to my websites .
im not usually a lover of musicals , but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be oliver.this film is so well made , the characters are well depicted , the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great , my favourite being 'reviewing the situation'sung by ron moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of fagin.i was n't old enough to see oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were , so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs , usually it was 'who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.its a timeless musical you definitely could n't remake it , it stands on its own.its not accurate to the book and i do n't think it would have worked so well if it had been.i do n't think charles dickens would be disappointed , as he wrote oliver to depict the poverty in london , the orphanages , the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive , and the film portrays this very well.also another great reason to watch this film is bullseye the old type english bull terrier , notice his long thin legs , this was bred out of the breed many years ago , they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him , and he is exactly how an english bull terrier would have looked in victorian times.notice he has scars { which is probably makeup } on his face , bill sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.a victorian bull terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.his a beautiful dog any way , and notice he disobeys bill sykes after he has killed nancy , he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head bill sykes thought he was.this is a great musical to watch if you like musicals , and if you do n't like musicals give it a try any way , there 's something for everyone in this film .
this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would , for adults . the idea of a child 's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful . at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she 's really exploring her subconscious , just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep . the bit that gives me goose-pimples is when her dad is in the paper house , and chases her . the only thing i ca n't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film ... it really is n't . if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use , then watch paperhouse .
i do n't see how this show is like the oc at all . first of all , the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life . north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time . second , the oc takes place in california . north shore takes place in hawaii . and why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network ? i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part . it has a good storyline and plot . i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out . the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out . it was n't predictable like most stories on most shows . i hope fox keeps it on the air .
this movie is very hilarious , and it has a great compilation of actors like william h. macy which always have perform this kind of roles , maybe his most representative , fargo ; and george clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers cohen film `` oh brother , where art thou ? '' which results to be one of my favorite movies ever ! but it 's been hard to find `` welcome to collinwood '' , here in mexico . my city lacks of good places where to buy some good films . i tried to buy it at blockbuster but they do n't know it by the original name , so maybe it will be a little easier to find if i have the name they gave to it in mexico , do someone knows it ? , because i ca n't remember ! cheers . a .
i 'd have given this film a few stars , simply because it was a `` lifetime '' presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here , new york city . most on this channel , whether `` set '' there , in rural iowa , oregon , virginia , l.a . etc. , are filmed in vancouver , ottawa , toronto or some other canadian locale . but if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10 * on this site , it 's this movie . certainly not for originality , for this story has been done many times , in many variations , with several very similar to this specific one . it 's also been done pretty often on the big screen , with mega-stars , past and present , from cary grant , james garner , harrison ford , tom hanks , et al - and deborah kerr , doris day , meg ryan , and many more . i can think of at least 10-12 more , just as prominent , past to present , off the top of my head , who could be added now , and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind . not to drone on , but my point is that , in my opinion , this is by far one of the best of this genre i 've seen . i caught it by chance on a mid-day friday , at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . i 'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made . and , while the two leads have done enough to be known to most , they were completely unknown to me . the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman ( anna 's mother ) whom i 'd seen in some things from her younger days , and michael rispoli ( henry , charlie 's best friend ) who was outstanding as `` gramma , '' the menacing juice loan , tough , street guy from `` rounders . '' the chance meeting and coupling between both leads ' best friends , as a sub-story romance , with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later , is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre , but makes no difference to the enjoyment here ( in fact , it enhances it ) . checking some other comments , i agree completely with those which are the most positive . the primary word describing this film is engaging , in caps . this adjective describes the performers ; the characters ; the chemistry between and among all of the characters , in whatever combination presented , and all of the supporting and even minor roles . i love films with a `` harder edge : '' `` rounders ; '' the escapist schwarzenegger/stallone fare ; `` goodfellows ; '' even the classics like `` casablanca , '' `` gone with the wind , '' `` citizen kane . '' but for pure , uncomplicated enjoyment , this one was outstanding . with a bare fraction of their budgets , it was equal to the results achieved by `` you 've got mail '' and `` sleepless in seattle . '' and tom hanks and meg ryan could n't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here ; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films , as well .
on rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind , warm the heart and touch the very soul . `` lou '' is such a film . i got `` lou '' from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business . she watched it for a second time with me . we were both enthralled . her as if for the first time again . `` lou '' is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place . it does this while being relentlessly entertaining . bret carr 's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen . he crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like , stuttering innocence , but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you 're watching a movie . when the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax , i saw my wife in tears for the second time . as a life coach , i facilitate individual growth and transformation , and this film is a `` must see '' for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation . it is a brilliant , creative masterpiece with the power to change lives !
of course the plot , script , and , especially casting are strong in the film . so many fine things to see . one aspect i liked especially is the idea of the antagonist -- luzhini 's ( turturro 's ) -- ex-mentor working his evil on the sidelines . his chess opponent -- an italian dandy in three piece and cane -- turns out to be a real gent , and a truly fine chess player . to his credit the `` opponent '' nobly goes along with the plan at the end to complete the final game for the championship posthumously ( luzhin has taken a flyer out a window -- sad , but so releasing to him ) by way of the unstable genius ' widow ( emily watson . ) in death , then , because of the gallantry of an honorable chess master , luzhin 's defence ( which he worked out in a late moment of lucidity ) is allowed to be played . the italian gent commends the play and calls it brilliant . talk about a dramatic `` end game ! ''
some people might call `` paulie '' a kids ' movie , but i wish to assert that it 's more than that . probably more than anything else , this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states - topical given the recent debates . portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor ( tony shalhoub ) of how he searched america for his original owners , the movie tells several stories . there 's the elderly woman ( gena rowlands ) whom he befriends , then a mexican immigrant ( cheech marin ) , and others . all in all , it 's a very well done movie . i usually do n't expect much from these sorts of movies , but this one is a treat . i certainly recommend it . also starring jay mohr , buddy hackett , bruce davison , hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado .
went to see this finnish film and i 've got to say that it is one of the better films i 've seen this year . the intrigue is made up of 5-6 different stories , all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town . the stories come together very nicely in the end , reminding , perhaps , a bit of the way tarantino 's movies are made . most of the actors performed very well , which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type . i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala , the lead actress , and juha kukkonen . i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna . her name , as you might have noticed in my review ; ) , is not heikkilä , but hietala .
i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my # 3 film . i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed . also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film . it 's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like så som i himmelen . this was a very good film and i 'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it 's large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing . helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen . i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast . i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10 .
i remember this movie . quite intense for an 11 year old . good editing , i felt terrible for the st. bernard . i 'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast , but the signal is passing pluto as i write this . robert culp . a highlight of his career . i am just glad i did n't live in that neighborhood . oh those 70 's . what a decade . if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody . so what are they waiting for ? an excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys . it was very intense . i think it was filmed in los angeles . certainly not made in lodi nj . the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film ... and then they left the carcass on the stoop . rotten kids .
this has been one of my favorite movies for a long time . recently i was happy to see it on dvd which is a relief from watching the old , grainy vhs versions . i had n't seen it in years and watched it today to find myself amazed at how well the movie stands up to time . it 's one of those rare , perfect storms of comedy where great writing ( truly funny line after truly funny line ) is paired with great direction and outstanding performances all at the same time . dudley moore got an oscar nomination for `` arthur '' but lost ( although john gielgud won for best supporting actor ) . if moore 's performance in `` arthur '' does n't win a best actor oscar -it 's proof that no comedic actor could ever win the title ( another example is gene wilder in `` young frankenstein '' ) . steve gordon crafts the film beautifully keeping true to each of the characters and the warm-hearted tone of the story . quite simply , imho the movie is a rare gem . it 's only sad that steve gordon passed away just a year after `` arthur '' was released . regarding the dvd that is available as of 1/2007 , it 's so/so . although the video quality is a leap over the old vhs copies , there is still no widescreen version available . the dvd has a few extras that are nice but it 's just not enough . one example is commentary from the director stating how he greatly wished how certain deleted takes and scenes could have been included ( because they were hysterical ) , but that he had to make tough choices for a final edit . the dvd , being the perfect format to include such material , certainly should have offered it as well . this , the original `` arthur '' , is a classic comedy that is one for the books .
having ran across this film on the fox movie channel on a lazy friday afternoon , i can think of no better way to spend a lazy friday evening then putting in my two cents worth . especially when you consider the lack of user comments on it . does n't every movie , good or bad deserve more than four comments ? and this movie is n't bad at all . the first thing to keep in mind when watching a film like april love is to remember the era from which it came , in this case the late fifties . films were pretty much a happy medium back then . the cinemas were devoid of tragedy while the screens were filled with wide screen technicolor films in order to pry people away from the gray glare of the evil medium in a box called television . i do n't know how many people were pried away from the boob tube to see this one , but it managed to capture my attention for 97 minutes . teen idol pat boone plays nick conover , a young teen sent to live with his aunt henrietta ( jeanette nolan ) and uncle jed ( arthur o'connell ) out in the country after being put on probation for stealing a car . it seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son ( jed jr. ) so uncle jed seems has lost his zest for living . aunt henrietta is hoping that nick being on the farm will somehow bring jed out of his doldrums . story lines like this being what they are , jed and nick do n't really care for each other too much of course . jed then proceeds to meet up with the neighbors , fran ( dolores michaels ) and liz ( shirley jones ) templeton . immediately jed develops a crush on fran , and of course i do n't have to tell you that liz develops a crush on jed . then there 's the matter of uncle jed 's horse , a trotter who has turned wild and wo n't let anyone handle him since the death of jed jr. you could probably fill in everything that happens from that point on your own , seeing as how there are no real surprises . does n't matter though , you 'll enjoy yourself anyway . once you get over the image of squeaky clean pat boone , as a supposedly bad boy , you 'll have no trouble with the rest of the film . considering that , boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick . certainly the role does n't require much depth , but still it 's a nicely done job when you would least expect it . as jed , arthur o'connell is the perfect choice for the role . in the early going , he is unreachable and cold , but as he slowly warms up to nick , we see that he 's really a pretty good guy . jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta , who is constantly playing the part of mediator between jed and nick . shirley jones takes a break from rodgers and hammerstein and gets a few opportunities to grace us with her singing talents . as liz , she 's gorgeous to look at , great to listen to , and quite funny at times . dolores michaels as fran , who is a bit more on the wild side , is equally entertaining . the best thing about april love , is that there is not a true mean conniving character of any sort on the screen . not one true villain in the whole thing . everybody is so darn likable you ca n't help but enjoy the film . i truthfully find it quite refreshing , sort of like putting your troubles behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends . think of it as the old andy griffith show with musical numbers , a little more plot , and wide screen technicolor . the songs are a mixed bag , with the title song april love being the best of them . another thing i really liked is that they did n't fall back on using blue screen backdrops during the horse racing sequences , and they quite a bit more entertaining and exciting because of it . as a matter of fact , you 'll find the whole film beautifully photographed and it was nice to see they did n't skimp in that department . the chemistry between jones and boone is good . best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way to gain the others respect . this movie will never be confused with great cinema . yet , sometimes instead of going to disneyland , one just needs a nice outing in the park , and that 's what april love is . my grade : b+
this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good . as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses . i have n't read gerard reves book , on which the film is based , but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited poet/writer who gets his ( in a way - no spoiling here ) . an anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions , as has he . all this in a superbly packaged cinematography , paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute `` gesellich ( ? ) '' dutch locations into a suspenseful film-noir setting , impressive work !
the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians . the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources . it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement . it depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter , along with inventive mass communication devices , elevators , flat screen panels , and wireless intercoms . it 's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future . but it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation . to me , it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government . the pro-progress characters ( such as the two cabals ) believe humanity could 'live forever ' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations , always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants . arthur c. clarke ( author of 2001 : a space odyssey ) suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie . kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke 's suggestions ( source : clarke 's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel ) . though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies . it has a beautiful menzies art design , but mediocre special effects ( esp . the toy tanks ) . i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity . it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time . it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress . it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster . but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths . it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness : cabal : `` too much { rest } and too soon , and we call it death . but for man no rest and no ending . he must go on -- conquest beyond conquest . this little planet and its winds and ways , and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him . then the planets about him , and at last out across immensity to the stars . and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time -- still he will be beginning . '' cabal : `` if we are no more than animals -- we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass , mattering no more -- than all the other animals do -- or have done . '' { he points out at the stars . } `` it is that -- or this ? all the universe -- or nothingness ... '' ( quotes from screenplay ) . if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress , then the council members ( of the world government ) will seem like technocrats . but actually those `` technocrats '' allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely , and they would have to be suppressed by government bans , laws against science and experiment , and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants . in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council 's developments of science and technology , so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council 's freedom to experiment . the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though , only preparing its 'peace gas ' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress . so it 's also a story about the freedom to do science , just as much as it 's about the wonders of progress . many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises , except in cases of social bias ( many want to ban cloning , for example ) or naturalism ( some do n't want us to progress freely , and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth ) or fear/reason ( some believe we are n't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves ) . but cabal ( the president of the council ) has an answer to the problem of danger : `` our { scientific } revolution did not abolish death or danger . it simply made death and danger worth while '' ( screenplay ) .
at the end of the movie i still do n't know whether i liked it or not . so was the case with most of the reviewers . but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in . long ago i read a quote : there are 2 kind of writers , 1 . those who think and write . and 2 . those write and make the readers think . while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience . i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight club .... it is definitely a classic : something which no one understands but appreciates .... what i do n't understand : why stathom ( jake green ) had a blackout ( thats how it all began ) , all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one . well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about : i 'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not : then answer this first .... when you come across a puzzle labeled as 'no one has ever solved ' would you like to try ? i would
i 've seen this movie about 6 times now . and each time i view it , i 'm more impressed by the story and the acting . its like watching a train wreck being set in motion . its subtle in its approach , but very effective in reaching its goal . spoilers- > at the center of the story is a very nice dichotomy . on the one hand we have deputy major , eddy calhoun ( cusack ) unknowingly tearing at the old boys network that forms the hart of major of new york 's administration and on the other hand we have the mob boss zappati who 's deliberately trying to maintain the status quo through all means necessary . this situation nicely culminates in the end when zappati orders alselmo to make it easy on himself by killing himself and calhoun ordering pappas to do the same , politically speaking . the movie also contains some really great one-liners such as ( a personal weakness of mine ) : - you do n't sum up a man 's life in one moment - the only thing new in this world is the history you do n't know all in all , a great movie that deserves a much higher rating .
good times working with the quiroz brothers , and the entire cast on this project as the `` guy on the bench . '' i was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true `` b '' horror film . hopefully i will have the opportunity to work with pumpkin patch pictures team again in the future . i moved to detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release . one time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind . it was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as i signed her receipt . one day i asked the girl at blockbuster if the movie is rented often , and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer . at the time it was renting more than ring2 which was also a new release at the time ... the title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets . she also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people do n't want to give it back .... watch out for zombies when in the hood cause they will get ya ! jaysun barr ( guy on the bench-2005 )
the movie `` atlantis : the lost empire '' is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently . parents who have had to sit through `` the jungle book 2 '' or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one . the film is one of few to attempt at an original story ; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories . films such as `` toy story '' , `` finding nemo '' , and `` monsters inc. '' all do the same , but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney . recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video , and are sequels to an existing successful film . the quality of those films is given way to the profitability . a new era started with `` atlantis '' following it were `` mulan '' , `` lilo & stitch '' , and most recently `` open range '' . the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past . a good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis , a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years . including that of young milo thatch , voiced by michael j . fox . milo is employed by a museum in washington d.c .. his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist , who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis . this was seen as a waste by his peers , and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps . after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition , milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment . she takes him to her employer , a mr. whitmore . whitmore was a close friend of milo 's grandfather , and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis . mr. whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything . the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers . the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch . the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis . the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis , not just the discovery of people . it is enough to keep the interest of the older audience . the animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation . the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images . a feat not easily achieved , most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two . the characters are believably human . there are some nice chase type scenes , with lots of action going on . a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get . the creativity of the writers really shines through . the culture of atlantis is richly developed , including an entire language . the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources , such as plato . the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained . believable , if by a younger audience , that magic really does exist . the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic , but can best be described in this way . although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic . the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemo 's nautilus , complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes . the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology . the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been , even holding roles in leadership . this is not a bad thing . it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to , rather than an all male cast . one reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song , ever . a tradition that began with the first feature film , `` snow white '' , and carried on through to `` the lion king '' , almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs . this is great and all , what would the seven dwarfs be without `` hi ho ! '' ? after the millionth time through it 'd almost be better without , but this one spares the parent . not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song . i for one am grateful . the storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike . it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children .
for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity , you are in fact the mindless one . while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems , racial barriers , cliché 's , stereotypes etc . you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it . what i also love is that not everything is a punchline . for those expecting a formulated joke like friends ( i love friends fyi ) , you wo n't find it here . instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic . we do n't walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said , which is in most comedies . instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense . so do n't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that .
alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two dopes from san dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie . the only difference is that their trip is `` somewhere '' between heaven and hell and ends up being both . when they meet the grim reaper , they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have . besides playing roles they have ... er ... perfected , they also play ( and revive a couple of extra sales in the process ) some classic games ( i even have my original copy of battleship in the closet ) . the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with `` what it might be like '' instead of `` what was . '' without spoiling the movie , i ca n't give you anymore information about this ( i guess you 'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself ! 8 out of 10 stars .
i have not read the other comments on the film , but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary . i watched it for the second time with my children . they absolutely loved it . true , it did not have the adults rolling around the floor , but the sound of the children 's enjoyment made it seem so . it is a true mel brooks farce , with plenty of moral content - how sad it is to be loved for our money , not for whom we are , and how fickle are our friends and associates . there are many other films on a similar subject matter , no doubt , many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults . it 's hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family , however . hence , for the children , a 9/10 from me .
sure , this movie is sappy and sweet and full of clichés , but it 's entertaining , and that 's what i watch movies for . to be entertained . natasha henstridge is stunning , even with the short hair . her smile is radiant and her beauty ca n't be disguised . as for michael vartan , i 'm sure the women love him . the two of them seemed to really like eacb other in this film . i do n't understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them . i guess we see what we want to see . olivia d'abo and michael rigoli were fun to watch , even if d'abo 's british accent did creep into her supposed bronx speech . to tell you the truth i had n't really noticed it until i read these comments , but i went back to the dvd and now her dialogue sounds more british than american to me , but she was ideal for her role with that one exception . it 's a story of two nice people who are getting married to significant others , but who find their soul mates in one another . it may be an unlikely story , but who says movies are all supposed to play like documentaries ? it is no more unrealistic than any of the dramas that are screened every hour on the tube . that 's why we watch them , to escape from the humdrum of daily living for a short time and enter the world of the characters on the screen . i thought these actors did a good job of it , but hey , i 'm a sentimental guy who tears up easily . do n't get me wrong though , it has to be a sentimental scene , and this movie had plenty of those . i give it 9/10 only because i 'm saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie that i know will come along some day . if you see it advertised as coming up on the movie channel or lifetime movies , or whatever , make a note to watch it . i think you 'll like it .
i 'd even say some shades of hitchcock ... this is clearly better than mmm , which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans . by the way , did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery ? anyhow , woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one . the plot turns are nice and tight . i will say that in the first 20 minutes or so , some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines , but stick around . scarlett johansson proves well-cast in the diane keaton-type role , and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody . no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman .
here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film , and brant´s new film is exactly one of these jewel . there are some flaws in the film , of course , but they are very minimal . the directing and acting in this film are very good ! can´t wait to see another brant´s new film !
if you are looking for a definitive biography of the life of boxer james corbett , then this is probably not the film for you . the famed boxer receives a 1940s `` hollywood-ization '' of his life -- making the story far more entertaining and engaging than real life . however , because the performances were so good ( particularly by errol flynn ) and the script so likable , the film 's embellishments can be forgiven . errol flynn plays gay nineties-era boxer james `` gentleman jim '' corbett -- a man who became world boxing champ in 1892 . the film goes from his rather humble beginnings and follows his through his career through him winning the title match against john l. sullivan . however , while it could have focused mostly on the matches , most are rather brief in the film ( except for the final title match ) and the emphasis is on corbett 's brash personality as well as his relationship with the lady played by alexis smith . throughout the film , there is excellent supporting work done by a cast of wonderful supporting actors ( such as the perennial supporting actor in flynn films , alan hale ) and the writing really helped bring these people alive . what is particularly nice about the film is seeing the athleticism of flynn as a boxer . while a few of the shots are of doubles , almost all the boxing scenes are of flynn and he did a convincing job as a pugilist . this was a nice departure for flynn , who generally played `` pretty boy '' roles or swashbucklers and this shows just how tough a character he was . to find out more about this , try reading a biography of him -- he was quite the rough and tumble character before coming to hollywood . now as for the real james corbett , read on if you are n't afraid of finding out how the movie is n't accurate . first , corbett was not a poor guy coming from a poor family , but was college educated and bright . second , while he did get alexis smith at the end of the film , they also divorced a few years later . third , the wonderfully touching final scene of the film between sullivan and corbett was probably the best part of the film , sullivan was a jerk and this never could have happened -- in reality , sullivan was more the egomaniac and corbett was not the fat-headed guy they portrayed in the film -- though it made for a lovely film .
i love the way that this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it . the way that the screen jumps and flashes when you get hit , its very realistic while at the same time you have to remember that its just a game and your not really there . the sound effects and audio are amazing . there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not . you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic . the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you . if you want to get the full experience , try playing it with head phones on .
this film was made in 1943 when i think judy was at her peak ( looks wise ) . in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated . well in this film she looks perfect . she is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy . i think this film is hilarious , especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with john thornway . one of the funniest scene 's in my opinion is judy 's rendition of lady macbeth and when john is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking ( lol ) . one criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when john and lily fall in love . i mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love . another point i did n't like was on opening night . if i were lily i would be furious with john but she is n't ... it just does n't make sense . but all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect .
passionate , dramatic , riveting as flamenco itself , the film is simply amazing . it is set on the immortal bizet 's music . the original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists , leading proponent of the modern flamenco style , paco de lucia who plays a musician with the same name . legendary flamenco dancer and choreographer antonio gades co/wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated georges bizet/prosper mérimée novella/opera . he plays a main character antonio , the famous dancer/choreographer who works on retelling the story of carmen in the flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers . brilliant and graceful cristina hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role . hoyos had been the first dancer in gades ' company for twenty years ( 1968-1988 ) and she was the protagonist of three films that carlos saura made of gades ' three great shows : `` bodas de sangre '' ( 1978 ) , `` carmen '' ( 1983 ) and `` el amor brujo '' ( 1985 ) . gorgeous laura del sol is a young dancer named carmen in whom antony sees from the first sight another carmen , who was immortalized by two frenchmen , the writer prosper mérimée in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired george bizet 's world famous opéra-comique version from 1875 . as in the opera and in the novella , carmen in saura 's film is desirable and deadly , the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else . she could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission . there some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen , and as different as they are , they all have in common the only possible tragic end . saura/gades ' film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly spanish . i fell in love with it from the first time i saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then . highly recommended .
since siskel 's death and ebert 's absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper . roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he does n't like personally i.e . films with country music get panned because `` i do n't like country music ! '' and children 's movies get a standard `` do n't see it now , wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids ! '' roeper may well be an idiot savant , but in some other field . the weekly guests 'sitting-in ' for ebert fare better , but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat ? all that said , it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching . as for roger ebert , if stephen hawking can talk , so can you ! it 's your mind and thoughts we long for . do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self-declared throne .
this is no art-house film , it 's mainstream entertainment . lot 's of beautiful people , t & a , and action . i found it very entertaining . it 's not supposed to be intellectually stimulating , it 's a fun film to watch ! jesse and chace are funny too , which is just gravy . definitely worth a rental . so in summary , i 'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl ( if she likes to see other girls get it on ! ) the villains are good too . vinnie , corey large , the hatian guy from heroes . very nasty villains .
aro tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a mission in guatemala in the 70 's . also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people ( he used to kill pregnant women , and then he set them on fire ) . this movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts . `` aro tolbukhin '' is a serious work , so analytical , it 's not morbid at all . such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster . * my rate : 7/10
there can be no denying that hak se wui ( election in english ) is a well made and well thought out film . the film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition  a theme played with throughout the film where john woo 's hong kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in hard boiled ( 1992 ) and when hong kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the 'bad ' point of view , they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable , a good example being city on fire ( 1987 ) . election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes , spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful ( if that 's the right word ) manner as well as the clever little 'in pieces ' of film-making . it 's difficult to spot during the viewing but election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure : there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in  not everyone likes the decision but what the uncles say , goes . the second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from china that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the triads should and could be run . needless to say ; certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds , some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular . election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third . trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points . i got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested . this happens a few times : a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested ; there 's a secret meeting about the baton between the triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested ; some other triads are having a pre-election talk but the police show up and guess what ? you know . once the film gets out of that rut that i thought it would , it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving . the baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it 's been hotwired , another chase involving a motorbike and a kung-fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street  the scenes are unpredictable , realistic and violent but like i said , they are in a 'tasteful ' manner . where election really soars is its attention to that fine detail . when the triads are in jail , the bars are covered with wire suggesting they 're all animals in cages as that 's how they behave on the outside when in conflict . another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the uncles toast using tea and not alcohol , elevating themselves above other head gangsters who 'd use champagne ( the long good friday ) and also referencing chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate . election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise-en-scene as you look at what 's going on . some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies . the inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film ; hinting at chinese tradition in the process . i feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly : two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the triads all the while remaining realistic , unpredictable and violent : in a tasteful manner , of course .
i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips ; they forgot one of my favorites ... old person 1 : you know , i remember the first time they played that thing . old person 2 : you remember pterodactyls . old person 1 : and i can remember you fell for that , hook line and sinker . old person 2 : oh , i did not . old lady : you did so . you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians . old person 2 : ai n't you dead yet ?
the sensuous nurse ( 1975 ) was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula andress . man was she hot in this movie .. she was stacked and built like a * @ # % brick house . ursula was smoking hot in this movie . i have never seen a nurse 's outfit that filled out before . ms. andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man . even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots . one night , the nurse decides to take the grandson 's temperature and give some needed t.l.c . to her ancient client . the old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family . what kind of job did the family hire her out to do ? will the geezer fall for her car giver ? how can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family ? to find out you need to find a copy of the sensuous nurse ! ! italian but badly dubbed into english . highly recommended .
often laugh out loud funny play on sex , family , and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it 's seen since the days of granny and jed clampett . plot centers on two chauffers who 've bet on which one of them can bed his employer ( both single or soon to be single ladies , quite sexy -- bisset and woronov ) first . if manuel wins , his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses , he must play bottom man to his friend ! lots of raunchy dialogue , fairly sick physical humour , etc . but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface . bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy , teenaged niece on a year long `` missionary trip '' to africa . hilarious fun .
i know that originally , this film was not a box office hit , but in light of recent hollywood releases ( most of which have been decidedly formula-ridden , plot less , pointless , `` save-the-blonde-chick-no-matter-what '' drivel ) , feast of all saints , certainly in this sorry context deserves a second opinion . the film -- like the book -- loses anchoring in some of the historical background , but it depicts a uniquely american dilemma set against the uniquely horrific american institution of human enslavement , and some of its tragic ( and funny , and touching ) consequences . and worthy of singling out is the youthful robert ri'chard , cast as the leading figure , marcel , whose idealistic enthusiasm is truly universal as he sets out in the beginning of his 'coming of age , ' only to be cruelly disappointed at what turns out to become his true education in the ways of the southern plantation world of louisiana , at the apex of the antebellum period . when i saw the previews featuring the ( dreaded ) blond-haired ri'chard , i expected a buffoon , a fop , a caricature -- i was pleasantly surprised . ossie davis , ruby dee , the late ben vereen , pam grier , victoria rowell and even jasmine guy lend vivid imagery and formidable skill as actors in the backdrop tapestry of placage , voodoo , creole `` aristocracy , '' and haitian revolt woven into this tale of human passion , hate , love , family , and racial perplexity in a society which is supposedly gone and yet somehow is still with us .
regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem `` la bête '' of 1975 , one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience . borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time , and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors . `` la bête '' is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy-tale-like atmosphere , quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise . the fact that beastiality ( of sorts ) is one of the film 's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors , but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience . pierre de l'esperance ( guy tréjan ) , the head of a french aristocratic family , has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin ( pierre benedetti ) to marry lucy broadhurst ( lisbeth hummel ) , the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family . due to an old curse , mathurin 's uncle ( marcel dalió ) is strictly against the wedding . when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate , lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda ( sirpa lane ) , and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings . the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever-dream ... without giving away too much , i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film . as bizarre as it is , `` la bête '' is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style , settings and cinematography . the fever-dream-like atmosphere is present within- and out of dream-sequences . the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings , and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale . the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic ( elegant female nudity , ravishing actresses ) to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting ( close-ups on horses ' genitalia while having intercourse , ... ) ; in either case it is not likely to be forgotten . the entire cast of `` la bête '' is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters ( some of which are seriously demented ) . the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast , be it lisbeth hummel in the lead , finnish actress sirpa lane ( who sadly died of aids in 1999 ) as the ancestor in the dream-sequences , or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault , who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard . i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed . some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film , the scenes with the eponymous 'beast ' definitely being among them . certainly not everybody 's cup of tea , but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema . a true cult gem !
another woo 's masterpiece ! this is a best wuxie film i 'm ever seen ! woo - rulez forever ( except some hollywood moments ... ) . john woo - greater director of the century . maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors ... but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people ! his movies like the great poetry ! woo is a movie sheakspeare ! woo is a movie biron ! woo is a mozart of bloodshet ! ! ! ! imho violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust , but a instrument of art . themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films .
i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy . please , oh please do n't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel . just leave it alone . right .. moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is ... it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne . if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies , you will not be disappointed by the third installment . it sticks to what works and adds a little more . i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity ' and 'supremacy ' all mesh in 'ultimatum ' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne 's troubled past . the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat . the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch . i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street , making it even more exciting for me . if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments .. you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first . this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world . this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more . i 'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum ' might , just might , have the edge when comparing the trilogy .
this is my favorite of the three care bears movies . once again i liked all the songs . the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original . for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their `` cousins '' who they apparently never knew about . it was n't of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared . in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along . that being said this is n't a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the first . i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the first . but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears . i also liked the we care part at the end , although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene . and of course i loved the songs . my favorites being growing up and forever young . the care bears movies have always had such good songs . ten stars for a very good movie .
this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60 's italian style . from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man 's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper ' gear , this is a movie that should not be missed . it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield . apart from the battle scenes , some of the production and special effects are primitive , apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes , but for lovers of 60 's cinema it should not be an issue . i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs . i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time .
i really liked this film . all three stars ( connery , fishburne and underwood ) give credible performances ; and harris is enjoyably over the top . the lighting and shot angles in some of harris ' scenes make his face look truly diabolical . the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting . not a great movie , but an enjoyable one . i gave it 7 of 10 .
for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate , ( which basically satanised the english ) , it was interesting to see this film . by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in , and they were the only nationality present . it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours . all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict , and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts , often culminating in the suffering of the innocent . this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all .
space camp is a pretty decent film . the plot is predictable , but the actors do a good job , and the special effects are decent for the time . this film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster , and that really put a hamper on how popular it was . the scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen , that is ... on a tv ... it just looks average . i remember this scene in the theater . it made you feel like you were really up there . this would be a good film to see on imax , but i 'm sure that will never happen .
what can i say ? an action and allegorical tale which has just about everything . basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world ..... and more . he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains , and has quite a time telling them apart . a definite must-see .
when this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline `` dirty harry is at it again '' . whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it 's complete and total accuracy . `` sudden impact '' retains all the aspects that made the previous three dirty harry movies so successful- tight pacing , a compelling plot , strong supporting characters , endless gunplay , and bone-dry humor . some of these elements are not only retained but amplified- this is easily the darkest , bloodiest , and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise . the plot is somewhat intriguing : after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums , inspector callahan is sent on a forced `` vacation '' by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of san paolo . he is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his ( no doubt considerable ) misery by a second shot to the head . early on in the film , the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer- an artist named jennifer spencer ( sondra locke ) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier . this incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback , snippets of which recur before each new murder . as more bodies start to appear with the same m.o , it becomes clear to harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest ( guess who ? ) know more than they are telling . to make matters even more complicated , the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard . `` sudden impact '' offers relentless action from beginning to end . clint eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax . sondra locke 's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character . that having been said , it is fair to wonder if another actress ( who was not eastwood 's off-screen companion at the time ) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role- theresa russell and cybill shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates . members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include albert popwell as harry 's partner horace , paul drake as the psychopathic mick , and the truly scene-stealing audrie j. neenan who portrays the vicious ray parkins . however the film has some notable problems- some of the subplots ( the animosity between harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums , a mob vendetta against him ) take up too much screen time and do n't really have any bearing to the larger story . their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels . in the first half of the film it sometimes appears that dirty harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom . however the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between callahan , spencer , and her former tormentors assumes prominence . this second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given `` sudden impact '' the potential to be a first-class , neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough .44 magnum heroics to satisfy the harry loyalists . instead we get the film that eastwood and warner bros. clearly wanted to make- a superbly executed but prototypical eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it 's intended audience . this was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why . though not the film that it could have been , this is still big , trigger-happy fun . even after repeated viewings , it 's going to make your day .
pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel . mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across king 's creepy story pretty well . most people may avoid this , but they should check it out .
there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life ( not only in japan , but everywhere ) . it shows how stifling ones culture can be , and wanting to break out of the mold its created for you . the dancing was just a vehicle for saying `` do what you love even if its against the norm '' . rather billy elliot like i would say . i enjoyed that film as well . the humour was well timed , and the touching moments felt so real , you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife , the tantrums in the dance hall . i loved aoki - him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply howl ! the actors all did a wonderful job , the story was well written . i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing . good entertainment !
it 's cheesy , it 's creepy , it 's gross , but that 's what makes it so much fun . it 's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable . this movie is great to make fun of . rent it for a good laugh . the film centers around three women newscasters , during a time way before cellphones . they go to a small town to cover a festival , but they ca n't get a room to stay the night . and that 's when they meet ernest keller . he 's creepy in a psycho kind of way . and he offers to let them stay at his home . but he does n't tell them the truth about who lives there . stephen furst 's performance is so amazing as `` the unseen '' , that he really carries this film . most of the movie is kind of dull , although finding out the truth of ernest 's family is kind of interesting . just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look . barbara bach and doug barr make nice eye candy . i consider the movie an old gem , hard to find and worth a look .
yes , keaton looks like he really did enjoy making this film . with a skip in his step in his tailored pin-striped suits , he 'll remind you of jimmy cagney ! johnny ( keaton ) is the young hood who only does it to pay for his mother 's high-priced medical bills & to send his younger brother ( griffin dunne ) to law school . no one even knows johnny kelly is johnny dangerously until later on in the film . joe piscopo is vermin & does n't like johnny one bit ( & i do n't like vermin ) . marilu henner has a nice singing/dancing routine while johnny revels in it . i love the part when they 're in the ever-changing getaway car ! the cop who 's `` calling all cars '' is the skipper from gilligan 's island ! see this one for 1930 's gangster laughs ! the gags in this film are hilarious but you have to catch them or you 'll miss them ! look in the background of every scene .
i was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film . stardust follows tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her . the only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall , a doorway between england and a magical kingdom known as stormhold . this film was just a joy to watch , it has something in it for everyone , all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny . if i had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be the princess bride , a classic . all the performances are outstanding , the beautiful claire danes makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated michelle pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as larnia ... but the performance to talk about is robert de niro ... in every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show ... if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film . guys do n't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with claire danes and michelle pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout . the cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film ... nothing about the film seems forced .

retitled from its original japanese name of laputa ( for being an offensive phrase , something which director hayao miyazaki was oblivious to at the time ) , castle in the sky is the master animator 's third film , and it 's one of his most beloved of all time . initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release , it has since been embraced by critics and audiences around the world . inspired by jonathan swift 's `` gulliver 's travels '' , castle in the sky is a steampunk-themed action adventure tale about two young orphans -- young miner pazu , and mysterious girl sheeta ( who wears a magic crystal around her neck ) -- who team up to find the long-lost island of laputa , which is rumored to have great riches and gems . they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the feisty dola ( who at first chase them , yet turn out to be true allies ) and pursued by the government headed by its villainous topmost-secret agent , muska , who wants the power of laputa for his own benefit . for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours , this film is an excellent choice , featuring just the right amount of humor , exploration , wonder , and mystery to keep one interested . the artwork , although not as spectacular as in some of miyazaki 's later movies , is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations , incredibly exciting action scenes , and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel giddy . and while the characters that populate this tale are less complex than miyazaki 's other works , each has a memorable , endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over . dola , in particular , makes for a terrific comic character , shouting orders to her dimwitted sons one moment and being protective of sheeta the next . muska is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an irredeemable villain , but like dola , he commands every scene he 's in with a sinister charisma that is both alluring and chilly . anime fans have often compared this movie to gainax 's sci-fi adventure series nadia : the secret of blue water . after all , both works share similar story and character elements ... not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself . where both differ is in their execution . nadia , although charming for the most part , suffered from taking a wrong turn at its midway point , devolving into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot , even though it did have a strong ending . castle in the sky , on the other hand , remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time , and is all the better for it . while the film 's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some `` cartoonish '' moments , like a brawl between pazu 's boss and one of dola 's sons , it 's never to the point that it detracts from the film . about eleven years ago , disney released an english version featuring a cast of big-names such as james van der beek , anna paquin , cloris leachman , mark hamill , mandy patinkin as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as tress macneille and jim cummings . it also features an ambitious reworking of joe hisaishi 's gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra ( interestingly , the man behind this rescore is none other than the composer himself ) . as much as purists have cried blasphemy over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned rescore , miyazaki had no such problems ; in fact , he is said to have applauded the reworking , and for good reason , because the newly rerecorded music is truly the star of the new dub . while there are some instances where filling in some critially silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring ( notably the journey through a dragon-infested storm cloud ) , the overall reworking is fantastic and in many ways improves on the original , particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a fortress and the climactic moments toward the end . here , hisaishi displays his musical versatility and genius for matching music to visuals . as far as the performances in the dub go , the leads are probably at the short end of the stick ; james van der beek 's pazu sounds significantly more mature than his character , while anna paquin 's sheeta speaks with an odd accent that fluctuates at times ( a problem which actually works in favor of the character ) . that said , both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout . it 's the lively supporting cast , however , that really make this dub so much fun , particularly cloris leachman 's dola and mark hamill 's muska . both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they 're in ; as with the rescore , these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub . the script adaptation borders on the loose side at times -- there 's quite a bit of extra lines and/or commentary ( some of which are pricelessly funny and others somewhat overdone ) -- but aside from at least one debatable alteration ( sheeta 's speech in the climactic showdown `` the world can not live without love '' as opposed to the original `` you ca n't survive apart from mother earth '' ) , the overall characters , story , and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original . on the whole , there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track ; each puts their own stamp on this legendary masterpiece , and i like them both . ( they 're also better than streamline/jal 's more literal but frightfully robotic , lifeless , abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980 's ; do n't believe anybody who says this version is `` superior '' to disneys -- trust me , the opposite is true . ) either way , though , you ca n't go wrong with castle in the sky . it 's one of miyazaki 's all-time greatest , and i highly recommend it .
i have seen this movie more than several times , on tv . i always watch it again ... never turning the channel . this movie is full of chilling surprises , and absolutely edge-of-your-seat suspenseful , without being overbearing or stupid . helen hunt 's talent is magnificently shown in this movie ! i recommend this movie to anyone ! ! !
this is a really good film and one that i 've enjoyed watching several times . michael caine 's awesome as always . michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney . from the start it 's so well written . who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemary 's baby could write something this witty . let 's face it - michael caine , chris reeve , dyan cannon , henry jones ... how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumet . i 'm really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime . just watch it and adore it .
the `` movie aimed at adults '' is a rare thing these days , but moonstruck does it well , and is still a better than average movie , which is aging very well . although it 's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it , the movie has a wonderful specificity ( italians in brooklyn ) that is n't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers . ( i.e . mobsters never appear in acomplication . it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding ) the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread . these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value can not be impressed upon producers and bigwigs . i miss these scenes . it also beautifully involves older characters . the movie takes it 's own slight , quiet path to a conclusion . there is n't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax . cage and cher do very nice work . moonstruck invokes old-school , ethnic , workaday new york much like 'marty ' except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious .
i feel this is one of the best movies i 've seen , i 'm an older male and love most westerns . i love movies based in part at least on facts , if i am not mistaken this is such a movie . i also like revenge type movies , this qualifies there as well in my opinion.some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene . i felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how i feel about the complete movie . i saw what i think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode . i also enjoyed that.i recommend taking the time to watch this movie , i will watch it again . i also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played . i thought it was so out of character for randy travis to play a villain type , but i always enjoy his acting .
i read thru most of the comments posted here & all i can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life . this show , unlike most game show , was fun . mr. shatner , whose brill in all that he does , was again the hit of the show . he 's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes . he 's fun & makes you smile & that 's exactly what the show does also . the dancers & questions , the round-about fashion they 're presented only add to the shows appeal . and even though there 's a great deal of money at stake it 's fun . the pressure ( stress ) that exists in most game shows does not exist here . several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers & choosing questions , & c , like millionaire does n't have similar time wasters . all i can say is most of you have missed the whole concept . the idea here is to have fun & enjoy yourself . there 's something for everyone . qustions to test your knowledge , eye candy ( the dancers ) , suspense , mr. shatner 's wonderful fun-filled personality ... well if that does n't perk-up guys up then i feel bad for you ; and if that 's not enough , you can get rich ! i really miss the show . out of all the games shows that have ever been on , & to be quite frank , i hate game shows , this is the one i really liked & truly miss . the only other game show i ever liked was match game .
it is a tricky thing to play a queen . on the one hand , the actress has to be majestic and imperious , and on the other , she has to show vulnerability in a tough situation as well as the gathering of the courage and resolution to overcome the odds , since almost all movies about queens have that basic plot line . emily blunt is quite radiant as victoria , but it 's not as full a performance as i 'd like , no blame to her . i ca n't help but feel like this is a mills & boon novel adaptation compared to a darker , more dramatic movie about another young queen , elizabeth . hence blunt does n't get to run the gamut of queenly emotions , at least not to the full extent , since she 's , y'know , the young victoria . to see the old victoria , check out mrs brown . jean-marc vallee is an interesting choice of director for the movie . he last did c.r.a.z.y. , which was excellent and propelled him to fame . it was quite a different movie but i remember it looking gorgeous and that 's probably the main similarity between the two movies . but while vallee wrote c.r.a.z.y. , this one was by julian fellowes , and though i really enjoyed his gosford park , the story for this movie was much less interesting . i soon got lost with all the governmental politics . maybe it was less engaging because there was no potential beheading of the monarchy . i 'm just saying .
steely , powerful gangster supreme frankie diomede ( the always terrific lee van cleef in fine rugged form ) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection . fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe tony breda ( an amiable portrayal by tony lo bianco ) gets busted as well . frank and tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars . tony helps frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless louis annunziata ( smoothly played by jean rochefort ) . director michele lupo , working from an absorbing script by sergio donati and luciano vincenzoni , relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace , sustains a suitably gritty , but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout , and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio ( a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights ) . van cleef and lo bianco display a nice , loose and engaging on-screen chemistry ; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching . the ravishing edwige fenech alas is n't given much to do as tony 's whiny girlfriend orchidea , but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene . riz ortolani 's groovy , pulsating , syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin ' spot . the polished cinematography by joe d'amato and aldo tonti is likewise impressive . a really nifty and entertaining little winner .
you 'll notice by the stars i 've given this great film that ' ... before you see it the first time , ' is implied . i had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week ( and last ) was a very slow rental experience ( not much great coming in ) . i 'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too . still , it did . this movie is an awesome example of what to do if you do n't have a large budget . it had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark ; just enough . the entire film is you ( the viewer ) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns . i would have given this film 10/10 , however some of the shots were pretty fake looking . i do n't hold that against this film too much , but i do n't think it deserves a perfect score . lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious ( as always ) . i think she 's pretty underrated as a serious talent . nevermind her beauty ( which is difficult ) , she really takes her roles seriously and does n't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion . and she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed , as well . jeremy northam does really well , at first , as quite a geeky corporate rat , willing to run through any maze to prove himself . however , as he changes throughout the film , it 's like night and day . i know some fans of clive owen , jude law , or other hopefuls to become the next james bond will hate me for this , but northam would/could/should fit that bill . he 's suave and cultured . he 's got a great bond posture and voice . i think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it , and rather down-to-earth , as well . great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .
this movie has it all , action , fighting , dancing , bull riding , music , pretty girls . this movie is an authenic look at middle america . believe me , i was there in 1980 . lots of oil money , lots of women , and lots of honky tonks . too bad they are all gone now . the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl , boy loses girl , boy gets girl back , but it is redeemed by the actors and the music . there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie , and that includes american graffiti . it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it . every time i watch it , i am young again , and it is time to go out honky tonking . the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you can not rate a movie zero , i do not feel you should rate one 10 .
the last command ( 1928 ) is a silent film directed by josef von sternberg.it shows us czarist general , grand duke sergius alexander ( emil jannings ) in his days of glory.in 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has nothing.he also had the love of a woman , natalie dabrova ( evelyn brent ) .about ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution.his old enemy lev andreyev ( william powell ) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not.the last command is very good silent drama.emil jannings does memorable role work in the lead.evelyn brent is wonderful playing the woman lead.william powell is great as always.there are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie.like many scenes with jannings and brent.and then there is the ending with powell and jannings.this is a movie that touches in many parts .
sure , the history in this movie was `` hollywoodized '' -- but it 's far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses . lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british , not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago ; he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling , which caused his sailing to galveston ; he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero * or * a swashbuckler . but who cares ? this is one movie that 's sheer entertainment -- and face it , we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor . brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance .
wow ... i do n't know what to say . i just watched seven pounds . no one can make me cry like will smith . the man is very in-tune with the vast range of human emotion . this movie was skillfully and beautifully done . rare to find such intense humanity in hollywood today . i would compare it to `` pay it forward '' and `` crash '' as far as the show of both light and dark in such a raw way . definitely sticks with you for a long time and gives you a lot to think about . i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one . not usually one for a `` bad ending '' but rather a truth seeker that embraces emotion , raw life and something more than the shallowness that exists in abundance all around . therefore i do not mind a little pain at the end . it is true to life that there are n't always happy endings . sometimes its just not the happy ending you think it should be . many people were able to live happy lives though love and life of one was lost . if you are someone who looks a little deeper than the rest you 'll love this movie !
first of all , in defense of joan fontaine , it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce , the young british lady who has the title role . fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here , but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned . fortunately , she went on to better things . but here it 's fred astaire , george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing -- and they are excellent . fans of burns & allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire 's dance routines . especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar . they join astaire in what has to be the film 's most inventive highlight . unfortunately , not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story -- nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer . it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment . only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs . some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve . the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner , at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant , constance collier and montagu love ( as joan 's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire ) . it 's a lighthearted romp whenever burns & allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days . both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire 's footwork . director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine 's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera-work can not disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire 's dance partner , something she seems painfully aware of .
i think if you were to ask most jw 's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith , you will find they do not . i know i do not . what you will find instead is that they believe the promises christ made of a resurrection . so , even even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity , jehovah can , and will correct this . it really gets down to a simple question : is god real to you or is this all just make believe ? if he is real , and you trust him , you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be . i had a heart attack about a year and a half ago . one in my family was horrified when she saw the words `` no blood '' written in large letters over my chart . i reasoned with her that if i were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life , would that be a good time to anger the only one could return me to life when the time came ? she did n't get it -- god just is n't real enough to her . too bad . i wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives .
this is a way cool fantasy movie . one of my faves , it really is so cool . the director is bernard rose who went on to direct candyman , he made a great start with this film . the film about a girl called anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday . she draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real . each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture . in her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called mark . she befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier . charlotte burke who plays anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that , after just one film , she should disappear and never be in anything ever again . she really does give a great performance in this film . hans zimmer 's score is also ace . much like broken arrow , the music is ghostly and mysterious . it 's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on cd anymore . the dvd is available in r2 only .
the title is onomatopoeic , the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails . it is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump can not have . the misery of those people is illustrated by the passing streetcar which represents the relatively unobtainable rich life of the middle class . the pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching . this was kurosawa 's first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking hues , colours seen only in dreams . the movie is surreal and surpassing in beauty . the compassion for humanity is the underling force , but as always , kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film . it is a masterwork by a genius of cinema .
wow , how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes ? it was surely the highlight of my year -- nay -- my life . as if the raptor graphics were n't amazing enough , the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie , even when the background did n't actually match up with the setting of the scene . wow , what genius . and while the movie is full of plot-holes ( for instance , a few clips of a t-rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber , screams `` colin 's a girl ! '' and runs out ) i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet . thank you sci-fi for another classic .
my god ! buttgereit 's masterpiece is one of the best movies i 've ever seen . closer to peter greenaway and jean-luc godard 's movies , this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks . all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive , in spite of the lack of money ( see the `` bridge '' sketch ) . highly highly recommended !

i last night i had the pleasure of seeing the movie bug at the florida film festival and let me say it was a real treat . the directors were there and they did a q & a afterwards . the movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot , a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid ` why ? why ? did he have to kill that living creature ? ' in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways , the man neglects to pay his parking meter , which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him , some funny , some sad , and some ridiculous . this movie has a lot of laughs , lots ! and there are many actors which you will recognize . the main actors who stood out in the film for me were : jamie kennedy ( from his comedy show the jamie kennedy experiment , playing a fortune cookie writer ; john carroll lynch ( who plays drew 's cross dressing brother on the drew carey show ) playing the animal loving guy who just ca n't get it right ; brian cox ( the original hannibal lecter in manhunter ) playing the germaphobic owner of a donut and chinese food take out joint . there is one line where cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying `` clean up that death '' which is quite funny mostly because of cox 's `` obsessed with germs '' delivery . the funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father , whom he heard earlier in the day yell out ` motherf * * * * * ' , while in the classroom . another extremely funny and surreal scene is when trudie styler ( mrs. sting herself ) and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show , from the film the boy in the plastic bubble . the actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling . there are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about $ 1 million , the directors phil hay and matt manfredi ( who are screenwriters by trade , having written crazy/beautiful and the upcoming tuxedo starring jackie chan ) have achieved a film that is great , funny and endearing .
there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii . but sadly , even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention , there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks . tachiguishi is one of them , and even though i loved it to bits , it 's not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it . in between his big and serious films , oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects . while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category , oshii has really outdone himself with this one , creating something that is very hard to classify , even as a freaky japanese flick . go figure . at its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video . but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture , oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes , scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level . oshii 's approach on the subject has close ties with dai-nipponjin , as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be . deadpan humor taken to the extreme . but that is not all , rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation . a weird mix of live action , photography , digital animation and puppets on a stick . performed and acted out ( or posed , if you want ) by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less , as the project was supposed to be as low-budget as possible . and if you think that just about covers it , know that the film is extremely dialogue-heavy , making it a good companion piece for innocence . the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural , political and even philosophical angles , fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues . and to make it even worse , the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs , making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material . needless to say , multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film . that said , on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious . various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post-war japan . the film plays like you 'd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold , but somehow the big and crudely animated cut-out photography limbs of which figures are assembled do n't quite make it all that serious . the range of characters introduced is sublime , shinji higuchi taking the cake as cow-creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast-food chains with his gang of bull/people . oshii regular kenji kawai provides , besides a pretty comical performance , a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky , strange and comical . a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects , complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film . visually the film is very atmospheric , though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective , remains toned down , only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time . which is not exactly a bad thing , seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy . despite that , the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film . beware though , because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer . if you do n't speak japanese , there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention . on top of that , the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow . the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about , i 'm sure i missed many of the finer points of the film . tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into , but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it does n't let off from there on . i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs . a dub would actually be best for a film like this ( much like container ) , though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for . with all of that said , i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film . it 's rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works . the film is smart , looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity . it is immensely funny , even if you ca n't catch all the details on the first viewing . but be sure to at least get this with decent subs , as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all . tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and i 'm not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe ( and the rest of the western world ) is still waiting for a sign of this film . but for those that like oshii , appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits , it is a film that can not be missed , even though it could just as well misfire . 4.5 * /5.0 *
the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening ... was there a lot of symbolism ? ... the 2 goldfishes - do they mean something in thai culture ? there 's not much plot , not much happens and it just meanders along . no real start , no real middle and no real end . rather unsatisfying really . it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them ... it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real . the move felt chaotic and disjointed . i do n't know what the pang brothers were hoping to achieve . maybe if i were thai it would make more sense ...
this movie is amazing . the plot was just ... wow . i was very surprised by gackt 's and hyde 's performance , after growing up in the american world of the actors who ca n't sing and singers who ca n't act . in this movie , a young sho ( gackt ) comes across a vampire , kei ( hyde ) . over time , they form an unlikely friendship . kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others , the half-life of a vampire . it 's a sad movie , but not sappy . the plot was very unique , and contrary to your typical vampire flick . the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing . the only fault i would say the movie had , despite it 's lack of a happy -- albeit peacefulending , would be it 's multiple languages . i had the unsubdued version ( i 'm lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese ) , so i would recommend getting something with subtitles . all in all , the movie was just awesome .
zp is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.the college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement . the explosion that daria imagines , represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally mark 's death anticipates the end that a sees for the movement itself . the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life . during the 60 ' and 70 ' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change . one of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from . i watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which a depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct . repression was the way to 'control ' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students . this society suffers from hipocresy , and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls . the dialogue between the policeman with the college professor , who 's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested . presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom , the stealing of the plane represents mark 's inner wish for it but , his ( going back or coming back or returning ( segun ) ) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said , a depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game . in my point of view a film to remember .
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand , and this film is no exception . what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him . during several battles , he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron , off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce . indeed , it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he had n't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged . the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have , ironically , become boring . the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster , the less people pay attention . which is where this adaptation of our sunshine , a novel about the kelly legend , excels . rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore , the film quickly establishes him as a human being . indeed , the reversal of the popular legend , showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists , goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd . here , ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder , one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it . no , i am not making that up . about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles . while the kelly gang were distinctly irish , australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly ( a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this ) . heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia 's most notorious outlaw . it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself . orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he does n't look completely lost without his bow , and geoffrey rush 's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state . but it is naomi watts , appearing as julia cook , who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film . although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly 's life , but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here . indeed , a lot of the film 's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative . once the element of police corruption is established , in fact , the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed . unfortunately , most of the film 's strengths are not capitalised upon . rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits . ditto for watts , and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins . i can only conclude that another fifteen , or even thirty , minutes of footage might have fixed this . but that leads to the other problem , in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact . one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well , but unfortunately , it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while . if one were to believe the impression that this film creates , a matter of weeks , even days , passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman , and the infamous shootout at glenrowan . annoyingly , the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here , simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll . that said , aside from some shaky camera-work at times , ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts , and it has a good beginning . for that reason , i rated it a seven out of ten . other critics have not been so kind , so if you 're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements ( and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout ? ) , then you might be better off looking elsewhere . especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly 's life .
prof. janos rukh ( boris karloff ) discovers radium x -- a powerful force to be used for atomic power . unfortunately rukh has been contaminated by the radium and starts to glow in the dark -- and his touch causes instant death . dr. felix benet ( bela lugosi ) develops an antidote -- but rukh starts to go mad due to the radium and the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him . the plot is silly and the `` effects '' that make karloff glow in the dark are laughable , but this is still a fun little chiller . it moves quickly , has some great atmosphere ( notice rukh 's `` house '' and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night ) and karloff and lugosi ( as always ) give great performances . there is also good acting by franic drake ( as rukh 's wife ) and violet kemble cooper ( as his mother ) . so it 's ok but just a notch below all the other karloff/lugosi movies . the plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow . still i did like this . i give it a 7 .
this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood history.this 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performances , music and direction.i remember i was in allahabad when this movie was running and it was somewhere in march at holi time , the people there were playing its song `` ooe amma '' at their loudspeakers in highest volume . if someone who likes to watch some like it hot and drools over marilyn monroe he should see this movie.thumbs up to govinda.how many of you know that this film was shot in south of india and after sholay could be one of the very few blockbuter to hit silver screen.with films like these indian comedy could never be dead .
oftentimes , films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime . whether it be the big name support or the project itself , paris je t'aime never falls into this realm . i believe i can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts . between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence , merging characters together in one last view of love in paris , i think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed . true , there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest , but in the end i have a lasting image , even if just a split second of each short vignette . love takes many forms , and the talent here rises to the occasion , to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotion 's many facets . quartier des enfants rouges : maggie gyllenhaal surprises as a drug-addled actress shooting in paris and meeting with her dealer . the reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes hands . quatier latin : ben gazzara and gena rowlands ( recreating a relationship from an old cassavettes film ? ) bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce . what of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other , it is all enjoyable , leaving a smile on your face . quais de seine : director gurinder chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences . it is a sweet little story of shy love between two people obviously feeling a connection , but unable to quite vocalize it . tour eiffel : i will admit to being disappointed that sylvain chomet did not get an animated sequence together , however , this live action tale of mimes falling in love at a paris jail has the same quirky nature as his film les triplettes de belleville . tuileries : the coen brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs . steve buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word . his facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled frenchman are priceless . bastille : here is a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about out of love only to have it come back in the face of tragedy . sergio castellitto and miranda richardson a moving as the couple dealing with trouble and finding how strong the bond of true love is . pére-lachaise : a surprisingly funny little tale from horror master wes craven . a little oscar wilde humor can add levity to any relationship . parc monceau : alfonso cuarón looks to be practicing the amazing long-takes he perfects in children of men with this tale of two people in love , walking down the street . as nick nolte and ludivine sagnier eventually come into close-up view , we also find the true context of their conversation of `` forbidden love . '' porte de choisy : a very surreal look into the glamour of paris . this is probably the most odd entry , but so intriguing that you ca n't look away from the craziness that ensues . do not anger your asian beautician , whatever you do . pigalle : an interesting look at a relationship undergoing a role-play that seems to have been stagnant for years . a little variety from bob hoskins is necessary to fire kindled . quartier de la madeleine : even vampires in paris can find love amongst the feeding hours . i do n't know whether to be happy for elijah wood as a result or not . beautifully shot and muted to allow the vibrancy of the blood red , this short is strange , but then so is love . 14th arrondissement : leave it to alexander payne 's odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voice-over story told of an american in paris to find what love is . her harsh , uneducated french is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents we 've been listening to until this pointjust off-kilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the story . montmartre : an interesting introduction into the proceedings . paris can be a city reviled for everyday activities like finding a parking spot , yet when love is discovered , it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey . loin du 16éme : catalina sandino moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance as the tale is bookended by her singing to a young child , yet totally different each time . place des fetes : my favorite tale of the bunch . seydou boro and aïssa maïga are simply fantastic . the cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for boro to finally ask her for coffee is tough to watch . sometimes love at your final moment is enough to accept one 's leaving of this earth . place des victoires : one of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son . juliette binoche is devastating as the mother , desperate for one last glimpse of her son , and willem dafoe is oddly perfect as the cowboy who allows her the chance . faubourg saint-denis : sometimes one needs to think he has lost love to accept that he has not been fully invested in the relationship . melchior beslon reminisces , trying to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp , quick cuts from his meeting natalie portman to eventually `` seeing '' how much he needs her . le marais : leave it to gus van sant to show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation . his photographer from elephant is an american working in paris who is the catalyst for gaspard ulliel 's artist ramblings of love and soul mates . sometimes one does n't need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the pauses .
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie . it 's based on a novel of the same title , which was equally good , though different from the film . really made you think about how you 'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters . recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent , spouse , or family member -- in other words , everyone ! though the production is n't quite hollywood quality -- no big special effects -- still , the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it . and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members , and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes ill. you do n't want to miss this !
i had first watched this several years ago on a now-defunct sicilian tv channel ; amazingly , the film emerged as a heftily-priced dvd from criterion : not being sure what i had made of it initially ( despite having attained cult status over the years , the achievement proper is clearly viewed with modesty even by genre buffs ) , i opted not to make the purchase  as i did with the similar and , to me , unfamiliar fiend without a face ( 1958 ) . recently , however , i managed to acquire the blob via a copy of the spanish dvd which , interestingly , ported over the two audio commentary tracks from the criterion `` special edition '' but , regrettably , i could not switch off the spanish subtitles during playback of the main feature ! anyway , looking at the film anew , i was surprised by how much i enjoyed it ( despite many a narrative flaw , which i will get to later )  as a pure example of ' b-movie ' schlockiness ( atypically shot in pleasant color ) and a time-capsule illustrating late 1950s social attitudes . the male lead was an early role for steve ( n ) mcqueen and , though the actor may have subsequently looked at it with disdain , his sole contribution to the genre proves fairly engaging : not averse to juvenile kicks but still essentially a decent ( and , more importantly , altruistic ) kid . the special effects depicting the slimy and expanding creature are not too bad of its kind and period ; the film itself rises to a good climax  beginning with the monster 's invasion of a cinema ( showing daughter of horror [ 1953/7 ] as i mentioned recently in that film 's review but being curiously screened 'flipped ' and which sequence , incidentally , would be featured at the opening of a satirical italian program actually called `` blob '' ! ) . as to the admittedly minor quibbles i have with the film : the monster is not shown traveling  it just turns up at a variety of places , never being seen by anyone ! ; there is a baffling over-emphasis ( tantamount to padding ) on the kids ' scrapes with police ; it is silly to have the town doctor shoot at the blob  as if fluid , whatever its proportion , can be destroyed by bullets ! ; equally nonsensical is having the teenagers alert the townsfolk of the danger by making door-to-door visits ( especially when considering that , at that stage , only mcqueen had actually seen the monster in action ) ! an inferior sequel emerged in 1972 called beware the blob ! ; the original was then remade in 1988  i watched this not too long ago but it seems not to have made a lasting impression on me ( though i know micheal elliott loves it ) . for the record , i will be following this viewing with two more collaborations between director yeaworth and producer jack h. harris , namely 4d man ( 1959 ) and dinosaurus ! ( 1960 ) .
`` i like cheap perfume better ; it does n't last as long ... '' - ralph meeker 's convict character ( lawson ) tells this to barbara stanwyck 's helen character , after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w/her husband in tijuana ... ! this line cracked me up , and also seemed like a metaphor for this film - that cheap is better than expensive , because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run ! i agree with some of the other comments posted about helen 's attraction to lawson . even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away , she did seem attracted to his fiery nature , and that passion he stirred up in her would n't likely wash away with the tide !
this is a very strange hk film in many ways . first , many of the action sequences really are n't that much fun . the very first gun battle the occurs in the film was just silly . not cool silly , or even funny silly , but just silly . that 's not to say there are n't some great action scenes , but most simply do n't come up to the level of some of the other films i have seen . the opposite side is that this film actually has characters , not just people . all of the main characters are interesting ( except for the head bad guy , who is flat as a billiard table ) and most are fairly well acted . all the protagonists in this film are just fun to watch . the dialogue is quite witty , and does n't seem to lose much in translation . this film is worth seeing , but i hope that uninitiated american audiences do n't think this is the best hk has to offer .
michael cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name , including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire the day the fish came out . iphigenia , however , is a highlight . adapted by cacoyannis from the play by euripides , it 's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the united states courtesy the flix channel . the film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big ' film , with the emphasis placed on the simple story : in supplication to the gods , king agamemnon ( kostas kazakos ) is compelled to sacrifice his daughter iphigenia ( tatiana papamoschou ) , much to the consternation of queen clytemnastrae ( irene papas ) . kazakos and papas are both outstanding , but it is the stunning papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen , blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game . strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .
i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i finally saw it , i took a good surprise.the movie is n't great thing but it 's very fun and the action scenes are very well done.this movie reminded me tv series like 24 or alias.it 's very similar to that series and it reminded me too , to the wolfgang petersen 's thriller in the line of fire.if you 're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies , you will be disappointed.but if you go with little expectations , you will enjoy the sentinel . rating:7
not a film to be taken seriously , but a great little film nonetheless . it 's definitely not just a piece of fluff . the acting , imo , is excellent . one of those films you would n't go out of your way to see , but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable . like an old friend . definitely worth seeing if you get the chance . - - - - - - - -
things to come is an historic film . along with metropolis ( 1927 ) , it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles . it is also one of the first doomsday movies . it is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the second world war within a year , and even , in a subtle way , the year it would end in the real world . but then the film departs from reality , depicting a world ravaged by war ( only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 ) . the last half hour of the film is an incredible sight , making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre . it is sad that , after things to come , sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies , a stereotype that would n't be broken until 2001 : a space odyssey more than 30 years later . if they 'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film , things would have been very different in hollywood . raymond massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film , to good effect . massey plays a great `` doctor who '' -like role as a pilot from an advanced ( for 1970 ) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord ( a very effective performance by ralph richardson ) . ultimately , the storyline covers 100 years . but that 's a big problem with this film -- there really is n't a cohesive storyline . perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of intolerance , actually -- it 's hard to have a conventional plot , but i felt more could have been made of the material , and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting . maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation : a sequel ? things to come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once . unlike metropolis , however , it might not bear repeated viewings .
since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio , i doubt we will ever get a real life story of enrico caruso . but if everything else was in place it was no accident that no hollywood studio attempted the task until metro-goldwyn-mayer had mario lanza under contract . no one else could have done it , i doubt whether it will ever be tried again . and why should it . i think enrico caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen . for his tenor voice was his life , his reason for being on the earth . to say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest . caruso , like the man who portrayed him , was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline . he had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film . his contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought . he 's shown in a recording studio once late in his life . actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with irish tenor john mccormack for rca victor made the recording industry what it became . when caruso and mccormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live . but a lot of immigrant italian and irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men . it 's why both became the legends that they are . what the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by mario lanza , a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a caruso to stick to opera . the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design . mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of songs from the great caruso . unfortunately due to contractual obligations we could n't get an actual cast album with ann blyth , dorothy kirsten , and jarmila novotna also . though blyth sang it in the film , lanza had a big hit recording of the loveliest night of the year further helping to popularize the great caruso . if you 're looking for a life of enrico caruso , this ai n't it . if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career , than you should not miss the great caruso .
i saw this at the mill valley film festival . hard to believe this is ms. blom 's directorial debut , it is beautifully paced and performed . large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel , i.e . they are layered with back story and potential futures , there are no false notes , surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth-shattering dilemmas . if you saw `` the best of youth , '' you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments , even as the story moves briskly along . i really hope this gets distribution in the usa . i live in a fairly sophisticated film market , yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind .
sure it may not be a classic but it 's one full of classic lines . one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later ( maybe it was on cinemax one too many times ! ) michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie -- he ca n't seem to figure out how to play it -- but he 's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof . looking for a movie to cheer you up ? this is it but rent it with friends -- it 'll make it even better .
jack lemmon and walter matthau began and ending their career together . remember best as the grumpiest of old men as well as the oddest couple to have ever made us laugh , lemmon and matthau were one of hollywood 's best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years . not as `` raunchy '' as pryor and wilder , instead , they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern marx brothers routine . such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that marx , chaplin and keaton were so famous for . in the odd couple , lemmon and matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos . the physical comedy is as unique as chaplins . the joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another . not your typical guy film , it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime . the chemistry between lemmon and matthau is entertainment enough . although this movie is n't for everyone , this is a great comedy .
stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd ( a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell ) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he 's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs ) , who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants . todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise . director paul w.s . anderson , working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples , depicts a chilling vision of a bleak , cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough , gritty tone throughout . moreover , anderson handles moving moments of humanity well ( todd 's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant ) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto . russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd ; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions . bang-up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607 , connie nielson as the compassionate sandra , sean pertwee as the kindly mace , jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan , gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church , michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig , and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins . better still , this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might . david tattersall 's polished cinematography , joel mcneely 's rousing full-bore orchestral score , and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing .
if you have any clue about jane austen´s production , you´ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels : marriage , marriage and marriage ! in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring , but i like austen´s characters , because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma . the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow , she´s very good in her leading role . also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious .
i rented this film because of my interest in american history , and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons . this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his `` vision '' into a major world religion . it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo , illinois . it portrays the trial of joseph smith . within the course of that trial , brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism , and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith . then smith is assassinated , and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land . despite his grave doubts , he perseveres , and finally has a vision ( that utah is the place for his colony ) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership . later , as crops are destroyed by crickets , he again doubts that he has truly been chosen -- however , a miracle occurs , which cements his place in history . i found the performances to be moving , and the story to be convincing and interesting . i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal . polygamy is a part of the story , but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised . the issue is not emphasized . i 'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter , but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout .
after tracking it down for half a year , i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing . not disappointing because i 'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro . but i could n't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such . in his respectable self now , i 'm sure he cringes that he made this movie . nevertheless , they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed , ill at ease and half depressed most of the time . man , i still ca n't believe he made this movie ... i had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie .... hahahaha .... but i 'm glad to have watched it . thank goodness he has grown up ....
considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the johnny weissmuller tarzan films , i have no argument with that , although there are a couple of others i thought just as entertaining . one thing : it 's the longest of the series that i 've seen at 105 minutes . i 've only seen six of them but this was longer than i 'm used to and with the drawn-out action finale i thought the whole thing was a bit too long . nonetheless , it is a good mixture of action , suspense and romance . the only things missing are color and stereo sound . the primitive special-effects do n't bother me , as that was all that they had back in the 1930s . among some , this film is most noted for one thing : skin ! `` jane '' never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the hays ' code was instituted by the time the next tarzan film was made . her outfit showed what a great figure maureen o'sullivan possessed . the nude underwater scene , however , was not her - by a longshot . the woman under the water did n't have a good figure at all , whoever it was . there is plenty of action in here . up to the finale , it was not overdone , either . the ending went on for 15 minutes , though , and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch . still , this movie offers about everything - except `` boy '' ( their adopted son ) - you 'd want to see in a tarzan film , even o'sullivan doing her tarzan yell about a dozen times . with her pair of `` lungs , '' that was no problem .
this , i think , is one of the best pictures ever made . it 's so pure and beautiful . it really touched me . i 'm glad david lynch proved that a film does n't necessarily need sfx , a twisting , complicated plot or flashy images . way to go , dave . i 'd like to see cronenberg do that !
i was intrigued by the title , so during a small bout of insomnia ( fueled by my curiosity ... ) , i stayed up and watched it . i then checked my tv listings and watched it again ! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film- in spite of politics , traditions , culture , etc. , teenagers everywhere are virtually the same . the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to , let 's say , somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period , and language differences aside , would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era . they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations , politics aside : music , sex , movie idols , music , drinking , sports , music ... as a matter of fact , much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970 's southern california . this was a bittersweet story , but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable . the characters , especially the young actors , were completely believable also . i wo n't say this was the yugoslav `` american graffiti '' , but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50's-themed movies .
this movie is very cool . if you 're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films , you should love this . this film is the asian lord of the rings : a high fantasy story , based in actual chinese mythology . ( i realize many critics have called this film plot-less , i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology . ) if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven & earth , this one should be right up your alley . this film is still very difficult to find in the u.s. , even though it was purchased for u.s. distribution along with crouching tiger , hidden dragon and iron monkey . well worth the search ! ! ! this dvd is also worthy of owning .
well , i 'll be honest : it is not exactly a sholay . but you cant get a sholay every week . in fact , you could see distinct signatures of `` not without my daughter '' ( sally field , 1991 ) in this movie . however , as most `` inspired '' movies go , this one was a well-inspired one , well handled and well done . nana patekar , as usual , tends to overdo his hysterics , but all others are commendable . specially so about dipti naval : saw her after a long time , but she has n't lost any of her grace . in fact , she has performed much better that when i last saw her . another one of the bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age ? all in all , a nice watch .
okay . this has been a favourite since i was 14 . granted , i do n't watch it multiple times a year anymore , but ... this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message . this movie is fun . it 's pretty dated , almost passe , but parker posey is so brilliant that it 's unbelievable . if you want to be charmed by a 90 's breakfast at tiffany 's , attended 90 's raves , or love parker , this movie is for you . otherwise , do n't bother .
this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen . eddie izzard is a genius , he picks in brits , americans and everyone in between . his style is completely natural and completely hilarious . i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a * * off . watch , enjoy , it 's funny .
this is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago . it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered . clothes and music might have changed over time , but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up-to-dateness . and especially this movie does the job pretty well . of course it is cheesy at times , but very touching as well . jodie foster 's performance is striking , and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies . do n't miss this one .
you know the story - a group of plucky no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it 's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood ( bring it on , the karate kid , escape to victory , best of the best etc ) . now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying . the fact that this movie does n't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters , and this in turn keeps you watching to the end . fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films ; the action is limited to ( albeit impressive ) kicking and the occasional punch . this does n't matter though , since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success .
a masterful treatment of james caine 's `` the postman always rings twice '' as luchino visconti 's first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy . the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today . a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai ( who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe '' ( 1941 ) , star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband . unusual ending in which , although crime does not pay , one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime . excellent direction , script , acting , and cinematography . reportedly not as good as the french `` le dernier tournant ' ( 1939 ) but probably better than the us version ( 1946 ) featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles . highly recommended .
i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the `` so bad it 's good '' type of viewing . however , i really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it 's innovation . the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic , but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements . billy zane moves with incredible expression ( see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement ) and is framed by some unexpected stars . you may not like this film , you may not enjoy it , but if you get the chance to watch it , then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face , and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars . highly reccomended .
i 'm sick of people whining about ewoks ! true , they 're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars , but they did happen , so deal with it ! besides , they are cute , and i do n't care if they 're marketable . yubb nubb ! this movie always leaves me in tears . it 's perfect . the end could not be better . i 'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin . i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way . so those of you who are complaining that vader 's helmet was removed , take a moment to think about it . it 's very effective . vader , the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years , is finally revealed as a sick-looking man . he is not entirely machine - he 's vulnerable . i do n't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope . they all do so well . they are believable characters . hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development . fisher does a fine job being a female role model ( i mean , come on ! she killed jabba even when so many others had failed ! ) . harrison ford - need i say more ? the music is once again brilliant . it 's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie . the best climax is when luke shouts `` nooo ! '' and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle . john williams is nothing short of a genius ! what an amazing man ! already , the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i. i ca n't wait to finally see it in the theatres ( can i wait ? ? ? ) and then watch the original trilogy yet again . bravo !
`` hollywood north '' is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like toronto , in this case , later in vancouver . peter o'brian , the director , probably saw a lot of the invaders from california that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that canada presented . needless to say , `` moon lantern '' , the successful novel written by a canadian author is turned into `` flight to bogota '' , which has nothing to do with the original film . a great egotistical has-been , michael baytes , who is obsessed with what is happening in iran , is offered the lead part , which turns to be a disaster . the film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth , which seems to be the case with the ultimate product , which is saved by its producer , bobby myers . with the help of sandy ryan , who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in toronto , parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last . the filming process is hilarious , and the acting , in general , is good .
in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie . i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible . after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice . i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so . it is amazing . i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt . do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era . strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming , do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes . thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie .
i 've watched this movie twice , and i plan to see it again . it is the movie that puts you in the director 's place , regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel . it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was , and the horrible murder described there . it is really worth watching .
neil simon 's the odd couple set up a model for many of his later plays . felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original , the former being picky and neat , the latter being slovenly and loose . simon would rewrite ( less successfully ) the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple , with female roommates . he made it a mixed couple ( a woman with her daughter , and a man ) in the goodbye girls . he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys , a broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark , the aged , semi-retired vaudevillians . here the `` apartment '' problem is reduced to a teaming of two men who ca n't stand each other . the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie , and george burns as al . in actuality , al probably does not think totally badly of willie - willie is pathological on the subject of al . first al had little habits , such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter `` t '' , and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger , on stage . secondly , al retired when his wife died . willie was not ready to retire ( and has been forcing his nephew and agent , ben ( richard benjamin ) to try to get him jobs in commercials . but willie ca n't remember lines unless they are funny , and keeps flubbing them . so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial . ben is asked to get the two back together for a live scene of their most famous sketch on a television show about american comedy . he does bring al to see willie , and the sparks begin flying , as neither can figure out what the other is doing ( and this is just in rehearsal . on top of that , willie is insisting on changes ( minor ones , but they throw off al ) such as saying `` enter ! ! ! '' when al knocks on the door . the initial rehearsal is a failure , but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show . the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al 's neck ? the three leads , matthau , burns , and benjamin , do very well with the one-liners , frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter ( example : `` chest pains ... i 'm getting chest pains uncle willie . every thursday i come here and get chest pains ! '' `` so , come on fridays ! '' ) . benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle , although matthau 's rough outer shell makes it difficult ( he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville ) . matthau has a little better grasp on reality ( at first ) than burns , who seems senile by his repeating himself - but in actuality matthau 's sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly . burns is not senile - he takes things slowly . but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement . i call this a final `` voyage of discovery '' for our modern lewis and clark . al and willie transcend their old skits , as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought . even the irascible willie admits that al may be ( to him ) a pain in the ass , but he was a funny man . burns was not the original choice for the part of `` al lewis '' ( supposedly dale of the team smith and dale ) . jack benny was . benny probably would have done a good job , but ill-health forced him out ( he died in 1975 ) . burns ( whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator ) turned in such a fine performance that he got the `` oscar '' for best supporting actor , and was to have a career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god ! ; oh god , you devil ; and going in style . he died in 1996 age 100 , having proved that he was more than just a brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan .
i loved this movie . it is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum vietnam , and this movie-sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire- did it . i had no idea i 'd be so affected by it . what an amazing look at how alien vets feel . it was tough to watch , quite frankly . we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama , but this is so so different . what happens when they come back and try to live a life ? they ca n't . it made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in america . not able to relate , ca n't sleep , ca n't have love affairs , ca n't deal with `` normal society '' . they feel totally apart . this is a huge tragedy , and one that is n't addressed enough . yeah , we 've changed our attitude about vietnam vets , we like them now , but so what ? it does n't seem to have made any difference to them . it 's too late ? so it was a great film , but i cried a lot . i have no other criticisms .
this cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters . especially , of course , the two leading characters . jack lemmon plays felix , a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she could n't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer . so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails . walter matthau plays oscar , his friend , an untidy , unreliable sports-reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment . he offers his distressed friend felix a new home in his apartment . and soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters ca n't live together for a long time . felix turns oscar 's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat . he cleans and cooks the whole time . after a short while , oscar feels persecution mania ... filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted . above all , jack lemmon 's play is wonderful . he is the perfect clown . he makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way . look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper , because oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball . while he is preparing the drinks , felix sits with the two young ladies in the living-room . to get out of this embarrassing situation , he starts to talk about the weather . a minute later , he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children . suddenly he begins to weep and when oscar comes back with the drinks , there are three weeping people in the living-room . the film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes . an intelligent , entertaining comedy with much heart . 10 out of 10 !
i 've seen this about 2 or 3 times and have n't regretted it . homeward bound is not just a typical animal movie . its unique , fun and bursting with adventure . the things that make it a fun movie are the animals ( obvious ) who are wonderfully trained . a very good effort . 8.5/10 !
hidden frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best star trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was gene roddenberry 's mission . their focus on homosexuality , depression , war , and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other trek series and movies . the production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved , the stories are more complex , and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive . in season 6 episode 1 , countermeasures , there is one of the biggest space battles in trek history . the ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting . the real draw to frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds , but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters . there are also nods to other trek series and movies with places and characters we all know . i recommend any trek fan to check out countermeasures and you will be hooked !
most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else . i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable . however , because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films . a perfect example was the john garfield film air force -- in which a b-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the japanese air force ! however , pride of the marines is a welcome departure -- scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner . when i first saw this film , i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true . however , after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor . this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true !
i thought the movie was actually pretty good . i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well . the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell . i have to see the big budget one coming out today , obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable . when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it . there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related . the acting was pretty good the f/x and stunts were well done . a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst . and the boy who played the child . these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok .
having seen and loved greg lombardo 's most recent film `` knots '' ( he co-wrote and directed that feature as well ) , i decided to check out his earlier work , and this movie was well worth the effort and rental . macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek , excellent take on the shakespeare favorite , updated and moved to nyc . i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself - and very cleverly at that . the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play , and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeth 's castle . mr. lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories ( knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty-something new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood , with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure ) and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare . the movie is well-paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth . it reminded me of al pacino 's `` looking for richard '' - another wonderful shakespeare `` play within a movie . '' i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan .
probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet . not surprising , since king himself wrote the screenplay . the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house . one of the other residents is jud , a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area . one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard . the other is a path leading to the pet sematary , where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway . soon enough , ellie creed 's cat , church , is found dead . luckily , this happens while the family , with the exception of louis ( the father ) , is away for thanksgiving . jud takes louis to another burial ground , beyond the pet sematary , where church is to be buried . later , louis is greeted ( not so politely ) by church . he 's returned , appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in . maybe he was buried alive . maybe not . nothing more i can say without ruining the story . of all the king adaptions i 've seen this would be the most terrifying . the characters are real and the situations are normal . mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings . suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film , due in part to the plot development . the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever . then , of course , we have the conclusion . easy to determine what 's going to happen , but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary , and sometimes disturbing , moments . overall , this is a good film and an excellent adaption . if you enjoy being scared and do n't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then `` pet sematary '' is just what you 're looking for . non horror fans will want to avoid this .
branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play . hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film , almost an action thriller . the scene of hamlet 's meeting with his father 's ghost wo n't leave your mind .
you do n't need to read this review . an earlier review , by pninson of seattle , has already identified all the main shortcomings of this production . i can only amplify its basic arguments . bleak house was a relatively late dickens novel and is much darker than his earlier work . this is taken too literally by the director , ross devenish , who piles on the gloom and fog too much . when ada , rick and esther appear , half an hour into the opening episode , it is a relief just to be in daylight for the first time . in some of the murkier scenes it was hard to see what was actually on my tv screen . i watched the whole thing in one day , starting in mid-afternoon . as daylight faded this became less of an issue , but i have a pretty good tv and i have never encountered this problem before at any time of day . the pacing is very deliberate ( i.e . slow ) . i am sure this was intensional , but it is overdone . there are numerous shots of people trudging though the muck and gloom of victorian london that are held longer than is necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere . a good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty-minute episode , without losing a line of dialogue , just by trimming each of these scenes slightly . i do n't want to overstate these two problems . you soon adjust to the look and pace of this production . the more important issue is that it does n't always tell the story very effectively . earlier dickens novels are as long as bleak house , but are not nearly so intricately plotted . for example , i recently re-read nicholas nickleby because i was intrigued to see how douglas mcgrath crammed an 800 page book into his two-hour movie . the answer is simple : the book is full of padding . mcgrath cut great swathes of the novel while still retaining all the essential story elements . this would not be possible with bleak house . this production needs its seven hours . probably , it needs even longer , because many elements of its convoluted plot are not sufficiently clear , or as well handled , as they need to be . a few random examples will illustrate the problems . the maid , rosa , appears from nowhere with no background , so lady dedlock 's attachment to her is largely unmotivated . sergeant george 's acquiescence in tulkinhorn 's demand for a sample of horton 's handwriting is somewhat fudged . it is not made clear enough that esther is actually in love with woodcourt when she agrees to marry john jarndyce . neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement , or why . ada and rick 's secret marriage is omitted . in one episode they are merely lovers , in the next , people are suddenly referring to them as husband and wife . mrs rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage in the story and sargeant george 's estrangement from his family is left unexplained - as is the means by which she is discovered . tulkinhorn 's dedication to maintaining the honour and respectability of the dedlock family is understated , so his motive for persecuting lady dedlock is more obscure than it need be . the involvement of the brick makers with both tom and ( later ) lady dedlock is somewhat opaque . it is not obvious that guppy renews his offer to esther because her smallpox scars have all but vanished . this is only a selection : there are others . they are not major problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough . nonetheless , they are minor irritations that detract from its power : you should n't have to puzzle over little plot points . however , there are more important structural problems that do weaken the story in its later stages . the whole business of tulkinhorn 's murder is somewhat thrown away . bucket immediately pinpoints hortense as a suspect , which undermines the suspense of sergeant george 's predicament and the importance of finding mrs rouncewell . it also diminishes the impact of the sub-plot in which suspicion is thrown on lady dedlock and weakens the scene in which hortense is unmasked in front of sir lester . a more serious problem is that the murder , its investigation and the subsequent search for lady dedlock , dominate the story for over an hour , during which time we completely lose sight of the other main plot strand : the legal case and its effect on rick . his failing finances , his gouging by vholes and skimpole , ada 's despair , his declining health and so on , are all put on hold for an entire episode . this may be how dickens wrote the book ( i have n't read it for years ) but a good screenplay should keep the different plot strands moving forward together . finally , smallweed 's role in the story is so diminished that he is almost superfluous . his discovery of the new will , that triggers the final phase of the story , is also thrown away . it happens off screen . despite all of this , it is still a very good production . many of the performances are outstanding . individual scenes are beautifully realised . its accumulating sense of tragedy is very powerful . i would still be recommending it as a superb adaptation of a great book , had it not been for the 2005 production . in fact , i probably would n't be fully aware of its defects if i had n't seen how andrew davies did it better . i have been critical of davies 's jane austen adaptations , but i have to admit that he really knows how to tame dickens 's sprawling books . this is an impressive and gripping drama and well worth seven hours of anybody 's time . nonetheless , its probable fate is to be viewed mainly as a cross-reference to the near-definitive 2005 version .
this movie blew me away . if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of antz . the plot , characters , and jokes are better in a bugs life . also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits . it 's the best part of the movie . rating 9
that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield . it was on tv last night and i believe i had n't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i 'm now in my 4th year of college . although the film has many flaws , it is just so touching that you ca n't help but sit down , watch it , and enjoy yourself . it is also hilarious . danny glover 's ranting is just so over the top that you ca n't help but laugh out loud at him at most time . it adds to the film and i 'm sure it 's exactly what the director wanted . you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development is n't the best . a must see . i highly recommend . 8/10
anthony mcgarten has adapted his play , via satellite , and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time . chrissy dunn ( danielle cormack ) is a drop-out . she has n't achieved much in her latter years and has grown resentful of her family since her father 's deathbed confession . her twin sister , carol ( also portrayed by danielle cormack ) is basking in the media limelight as she represents new zealand in swimming at the olympics . a middle-aged , desireless and desperate director ( brian sergent ) and his good-natured cameraman - who is also chrissy 's one-night stand from the night previous - paul ( karl urban ) film the dunn family 's proudest moment ; watching carol swim to victory . this would n't be so bad but chrissy 's family is the epitome of embarrassing . first of all there is the matriach of the wellingtonian dunns , joyce ( donna akerston ) . she makes fairy cakes and cocktail sausages for the all-important film crew and refuses to change the way she is . her oldest daughter , jen ( rima te wiata ) is desperate to be something more than common . she has a nice home ( with bedroom walls painted `` blackberry sorbet '' ) , expensive tastes and a nasty parasitic attitude to match . she is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child . her husband , ken ( tim balme ) is an electrician and forces himself on jobs that do n't need doing ... as well as doing jobs that need to be done , ie jen . the middle daughter , lyn ( jodie dorday - who won best supporting actress at new zealand film awards for this portrayal ) is a `` knocked-up '' tart who has a dubious history with ken . both older sisters clash , the mother is in a state , ken is as bad a tooltime tim taylor , carol is fuelling her olympic desire and chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv - why should n't she be embarrassed ? it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare . i loved the sparring between jen and lyn . one is like an adult mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away , the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven . climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done . the performances are a treat and the film works perfectly . a great way to spend an hour-and-a-half .
i really loved this version of emma the best . kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly . the only complaint that i had was on mr. woodhouse .. i ca n't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter 's life .. she was a smart girl in the end though . as always , i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot . the settings are so spectular . it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as ireland and scotland ) i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with emma 's most excellently ! i am glad that i got to see this one as well .
i gave this film 8 out of 10 , reserving 10 for e.g amadeus , and 9 for slumdog millionaire most recently . this film is close to slumdog , but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life , mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully . to understand it you really need to be one of balkan . this is an amazing movie , much better and more contemporary of his previous films , which are boring at this time , i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie . i like humour ( balkan humour ) , photography is an art itself , each scene is artistic to the limit . plot is probably a fairy tale , do n't recall it now , but remember reading to my daughter-going-to sleep a similar story .
ok , so it 's an adult movie . but it really is very tastefully done . it 's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie . i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was . even the acting was fairly decent . the plot was more solid than most adult films i 've seen . the camera work was above average . it 's just a good flick ! !
dog bite dog is n't going to be for everyone , but i really enjoyed it . full of slapping , stabbing and shooting ( but do n't worry  the lead 's a terrible shot ) , it can best be described as a violent romp through hong kong and cambodia . edison cheng plays pang , a cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister . despite being filthy from his journey , he 's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant . if this sounds wildly implausible to you , you should probably avoid this film . it acted as my cue to suspend disbelief , and i had a lot more fun for it . chasing pang down is wai ( sam lee ) , a young , edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke . wai walks a fine line that has internal affairs investigating him , and his father , a legendary good cop , is in a coma following a drug deal that went south ( the implication is that wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings ) . there are a car crashes , lots of killings , and a strange and awkward love story on offer here , all played out in almost comic-book style . i suspect the humour was deliberate ( nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd ) , though the over-the-top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members . there are at least three points where the film might have ended , and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing , or the deletion of one of the narrative threads ( the light-hearted stuff worked well , so i would have left out the interactions with the three fathers ) . i 'm inclined to give it a ( high ) pass , however , if only because of the ending  i 've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment . this is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
lion king 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel . do n't expect the production values of a theatrical release , but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release . it is set up as timon & pumba begin watching the original lion king in a darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story . this is done with frequent comedic interruptions . for example , during one particular tense moment a home shopping commercial pops on and a chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote . these little moments pepper the movie , and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor . if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching a movie , than this may not be your cup of tea . animation is the best they 've invested in the disney dtv line , and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material . the newer , independent material uses a lot of the artistic style of the original . the voice talents are all well performed , though i could n't help thinking of marge simpson every time i heard julie kavner . many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations , but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive . the music has made me realize how much i enjoyed and miss a good musical integrated with a disney feature . the toe-tapping opening feature of 'dig a tunnel ' is well choreographed and hilarious . timon and pumba 's take on the lion king 's opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing . the only problem was the reprise of the 'dig a tunnel ' at the end of the movie , switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting . story line is pretty well done , and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly , though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility a little . the new story does n't seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well , and does better when it is resorting to full comedy . overall , worth purchasing . if you like all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-disc set , then go for it . for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on a good flick , wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away . damion crowley .
a female executioner ( played by the sexy jennifer thomas ii ) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker . and what a way to go . lucky this film is not real , or we would have a lot more people in this world on death row . it starts out real slow . low light and bad acting , like most ( b ) films . it gets better as it moves along . and ends with a bang . i would rate it very high on the low cost , very sexy movies of the 90 's . it 's a must see once the kids are away or in bed .
with this movie , it 's all about style , atmosphere , and acting . true , i did n't believe all of the plot developments , but it did n't matter- the terrific acting , the unexpected plot twists , and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in , and carried me along for the ride , and i had a great time . kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents , and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent . he 's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles ( robert downey , jr. , embeth davidtz from schindler 's list and fallen , tom berenger , daryl hannah , and robert duvall ) that i was simply blown away . i recently bought a copy of this movie , and i never tire of watching it . simply one of the best thrillers of the year . if you 've ignored this movie ( and chances are you have ) , then i suggest you check it out .
steve biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority governed south africa in much the same way as gandhi tried to resist the british empire 's colonialism in india . richard attenborough 's film cry freedom is not about biko or apartheid as much as it is about donald woods , the white liberal newspaper editor who risked his life trying to tell biko 's story . the film has a jarring point of view switch after biko dies in prison from tortuous behavior at the hands of south african `` police '' . woods , played by kevin kline , must choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books about biko or allow his wife , played by penelope wilton , to pressure him into forgetting about the books . in that case , biko dies in vain . what begins as a life-changing friendship between biko and woods degenerates into a standard by the numbers escape over the border yarn after biko 's death . oscar-nominated denzel washington is good in only his fourth film as biko , but something is wrong in a film that tries to depict the struggles of apartheid by focusing more on the trials of a white family for more than half the film . attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on biko 's rise to prominence instead of beginning where biko befriended woods . perhaps a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour film was n't exactly conducive to big box office , but the film was a tremendous box office flop anyway . film politics aside , the film still entertains and sends a message or two , albeit , in pg-sanitized fashion . * * * of 4 stars .
beside the fact , that in all it 's awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations , this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it 's best ! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it . as usual a woman concieling her true intentions . the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brother . the scenes in 'wiking land ' are just as i remember it from my early time travels . - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection . i recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill . -odin-
morgan freeman and paz vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other . morgan freeman is superbly human , relating with one and all , while paz vega is the edgy cashier behind the `` 10 items or less '' check out line , intimidating customers and bored out of her mind . together they explore , discover , and learn from each other . to do that of course they must be vulnerable , interested in change , and have a sense of humour , all of which they both have . i wish this film was realistic , i wish this type of story happened more often , i wish we did n't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds . the film 's message is based in the open heart , and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility .
this great movie has failed to register a higher rating than 5 ! why not ! it is a great portrayal of the life of christ without the ruthless sensationalism of the passion of the christ.johnny cash did great things for god which amazingly are shunned and neglected in areas where they should matter most , like our churches.the film itself took less than a month to film as johnny felt the strong presence of god guiding him through it.great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans.at least the billy graham crusade rated it highly enough to use it as a prime source of education for new christians.thanks fox for producing it.as walk the line proved that it was freakish that this man survived yet alone produced such an underrated masterpiece.movies are not canonized through popular vote as this production proves ! in summary i believe that this film is one of the worlds great documentaries as it is forthright , honestly portrayed and a great witness to the christian faith !
this was playing at our theater in amsterdam and the film we wanted to see was sold-out so we went to this , not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet . we were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of earth . this film has some of the most breathtaking photography i have ever seen in a film and took me places from deserts to oceans to rain forests and displayed things i have never seen in a film , tv or book ! `` earth '' is a film that every student should see before they become jaded . i will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be inheriting the planet we leave her . this is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic .
henry thomas was `` great '' . his character held my attention . i was so `` into '' the story that i forgot it was n't real . i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was . the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character . the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring . i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head , in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself .
as far as horror flicks go , this one is pretty darn good . while it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense , it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if you 're into the horror/comedy genre .
anyone who loves the rheostatics ' music is going to enjoy this film . i have some minor complaints , mainly about pacing and the casting of certain actors ( not maury ) who are n't really convincing in their roles , but i do n't have time write a detailed review . i just want to warn anyone who has seen this film or plans to watch this film as presented cbc television in canada : the version that airs are the cbc is like the reader 's digest version of whale music -- -do n't watch it . it cuts out entire scenes and subplots ( if you can them that ) from the film . the cbc , which presents most of films untouched , took half the guts out of whale music . i do n't know why . it 's horrible what they did to the film . rent the video or watch it in a theatre , but do n't watch it on cbc television .
i was able to watch this movie in its entirety and was deeply moved by it . i was n't sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both . mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since aunt bee ! they are vibrant , beautiful , sexy ! the only drawback in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in either the `` mtm '' or `` rhoda '' shows from the 1970 's . i 'd have thought that since it was set in new york city ( where `` rhoda '' had been set ) that at least some mention would have been made of her sister brenda or that julie kavner would have appeared , assuming of course she was still in the big apple . it is my hope that abc will make this a series and bring back for guest appearances all the old casts of these shows . by the way , what was wrong with cbs doing this reunion , or an eventual series ? was n't that the network that carried the `` mtm '' and `` rhoda '' shows ?
had a bad day ? dog bit the mailman ? car would n't start ? people got on your nerves ? then refresh yourself with a delightful experience . two women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a month 's rental of a villa in italy . due to financial circumstances , two other women join them . two have humdrum marital lives ; one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past ; the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life . as the spell of the villa permeates their spirits , each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook . this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them . as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with them ... and you will find your outlook altered , for the better . a delightfully uplifting movie !
as you may know , the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes , 9 seconds and one frame . we have here : - samira makhmalbaf ( iran ) : what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing ? well , nothing . a great lesson . - claude lelouch ( france ) : a weak plot with a great cinematography ... just imagine a deaf woman living by the wtc who sees without understanding it that her dog barks ... well just see it . - youssef chahine ( egypt ) : the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion ... for everyone : for an us soldier who died ten years ago , for the people in the wtc but also for a palestinian suicide-terrorist . maybe the less tender movie towards the us . - danis tanovic ( bosnia hrzgovia ) : good images , makes us travel , for sure ... not a very good plot . idrissa oudraogo ( burkina faso ) : from one of the poorest country in the world , a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture osama bin laden ... and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is . ken loach ( uk ) : september 11 , 1973 , the chile entered in a twenty-years long bloody dictature . thousands of death , tortures : all that was offered to chile by henry kissinger and the cia , and knowing this changes very much your point of view ! i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters ! loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the wtc was built ! - alejandro gonzalez inarritu ( mexico ) : impressing images that we all know too well , and a lot of black screens . i did n't get this one very much , it is more an artist video ( to show in an exhibition ) than a movie . - amos gitaï ( israël ) : an absurd ballet of policemen , journalists , etc. , around a burning car in jerusalem . very well done . - mira nair ( india ) : about the anti-islamic feeling that followed september the 11th . very good actualy . - sean penn ( us ) : a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten , the wtc did have a huge shadow , and some places now have a daylight they never had . - shohei imamura ( japan ) : a different one . here there is not even one word about the wtc , and the action takes place at the end of wwii . it has only one message : no war is holy . this short movie gives very deep feelings , but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes . -- - so -- - a great movie , a great attempt to take the world 's temperature . i love it .
i love this movie very much i watched it over and over . i do n't see why anyone would think this movie was n't good . maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it . it is one of my favorite movies and i am not hindi at all but i do love it . it might be a little like `` pretty woman '' but i have n't seen that and i do n't think it 's any better than this . i do n't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but i think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie , and to those who say it 's not good at all well then i wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good . as for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people do n't like it . as for rani mukherjee ( i think thats how you spell her last name ) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever !
this is a slow moving story . no action . no crazy suspense . no abrupt surprises . if you can not stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking , about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance , do n't waste your time and money . on the other hand , if you 're into dialog , masterful story telling , thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie . i recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert , though , because the pace , the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood . it 's truly fantastic . i really mean that . ethan hawke and julie delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but , thankfully , the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural , warm and tender . they act and feel each other out from the very beginning , making you feel as an intruder . in their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner . i thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but i may be underestimating their intelligence . still it did not ruin the movie . the overall story is very simple which i think gives the movie it 's charm and ultimately it 's power . bottom line : the movie 's flow is slow . the dialog is fascinating . the story builds gently , systematically and substantive . the build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding .
this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever- a british , better this is spinal tap . the characters are believable , the plot is great , and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events- such as ray 's problem with fitting in the band . the soundtrack is excellent . real period stuff , even if it is in the same key , you 'll be humming some of the songs for days . what i liked was the nearly all-british cast , with some of the favourite household names . ray 's wife is priceless ... the film never drags , it just goes at the right pace , and has some genuinely funny sections in it . a generator of some really good catchphrases ! it 's a hidden diamond .
the 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they 're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies , and that they 're all the rage , what with lord of the rings , harry potter and the chronicles of narnia making loads of cash at the box office . this year will see ( and already has seen ) several more , most notably the golden compass , which has the most exciting trailer i 've seen this year . stardust , based on a novel by neil gaiman , showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep . i saw no previews for it , only a couple of commercials . the critical reaction is kind of blah . i would n't even have seen it if not for the fact that i have to wait on a friend to see the bourne ultimatum , and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend . well , if you 'll forgive the horrible pun , the stars must have been rightly aligned , because i went to see stardust , and i loved it . it 's not a huge movie like lord of the rings . the plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . but within that basic outline , the story is lively and imaginative . it 's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . and it succeeds wonderfully . there were a lot of big films this summer , but none of them were nearly as fun as this one . there 's a lot going on , but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent . it is n't a masterpiece , but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like the princess bride has ( though i do n't like it quite as much as the earlier film ) . a lot of fun to be had here if you 're a fan of the genre .
i just viewed murder at the vanities in the newly-released universal pre-code set , and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end . most of the other commentators have covered the story , a murder mystery within a musical , but i wanted to add a few additional notes . brisson and carlisle are relatively bland , compared to even most of the minor players , and neither one really seems to have the proper voice for what they 're singing ( carlisle being a trained opera singer , brisson a bit wobbly on some of his high and low notes ) . the great victor mclaglen and jack oakie play well off each other , with an excellent sense of timing that keeps the ball rolling between musical numbers . yes , lucille ball and ann sheridan are vanities girls , but let 's not forget the splendid jazz singer ernestine anderson in the `` ebony rhapsody '' number . gail patrick makes one of her early appearances , sounding a bit like eve arden ; patrick would go on to become the executive producer of the perry mason tv series . then there 's jessie ralph as the wardrobe mistress -- you 'll spot her also in david copperfield ( as aunt peggoty ) and the bank dick . the music is very good -- brisson introducing the standard `` cocktails for two '' in two different scenes ; `` sweet marihuana '' with barely clad peyote button girls in the background ( blood dripping on one chorine 's white skin was wonderfully chilling ) ; the `` ebony rhapsody , '' with duke ellington 's orchestra and a bevy of beautiful dancers , both black and white , mixing it up . and i believe this is one of the only early musicals to feature such a mix -- and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination .
as a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings , this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea . presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men ( i can not refer to persons who kill as boys or teens ) , the months of preparation leading to zero day ( the codename for the day on which they will attack ) the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun . it seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer , yet focuses on the literal preparation . the problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered . the only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending , as expected . but leading up to this point , it 's never really clear as to why they are planning this out . we are told the obligatory story that they were mocked , but the film also seems to contradict this . without ruining the film , it 's easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions , but falls short because of sloppy film-making . all directing is amateur , to further the homemade video concept , but the story and continuity is weak . the film seems to want the audience to decide a lot , but also fails to provide the information for such an event . the ending is abrupt , and does n't feel like it finishes everything that the film began .
yes , commitment . let 's say `` fever pitch '' might trick you into believing it 's a baseball movie . but no , you do n't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the farrelly brothers . but of course , if you are one , you will enjoy it even more ; with all the references ( pretty accurate ones , i 'd say ) to the boston red sox and its bittersweet history ; from the curse of the bambino and everything attributed to it , including those two words you can not pronounce in front of a boston fan : bill buckner . drew barrymore and jimmy fallon portray two people who , usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship : the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher ? thing is , fallon 's character wins barrymore 's heart by being funny , caring , sweet and downright perfect . but her friends ask her a logical question : if he 's such a keeper , why is he still on the market ? enter the boston red sox . he 's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his sox season tickets to him ; he has never missed a red sox home game at fenway park in a long while . and that delicate balance , how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy 's obsession ; and how much is that baseball-crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the other love of his life , is what this movie is all about . at first , you might think that the sports-obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief . well , i 'm sad to admit , they are not . myself , as a die-hard houston astros fan , can say they are all true . i would try at every way available to see every 'stros game ; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet . i read the chronicle 's sports section every day . and yes , my room looks like the shed , minute maid park 's gift shop ; with a closet full of astros gear , including 5 jerseys , 20 t-shirts and you know the rest . fallon 's character even has the red sox mbna mastercard . fallon was credible enough as the fanatical red sox faithful , even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon ( thank god adam sandler was n't in it ) ; and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other 's passions . i 'd say it 'll be a classical romantic comedy . not enough to be among the best movies in history ; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike .
i originally came across linda feferman 's seven minutes in heaven when i was 14 and worked at a video store and i loved it . i recently watched the movie again and have realized that it is a lost treasure . the movie stars jennifer connelly , almost twenty years before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind , as natalie becker . byron thames plays her best friend in the world , jeff moran . the film is definitely a milder , cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink 's and some kind of wonderful 's of the 1980 's , which is exactly why it is so good . it 's honest , not forced like those films , and parents will enjoy watching this movie with there kids . when natalie 's dad leave home on a business trip , jeff convinces her that he should move in because his home life sucks . with support from natalie 's friend , polly , played exquisitely by maddie corman , she lets him . but this movie is n't about putting kids in situations and seeing what they can get away with . the three leads are so natural and the script , surprisingly so honest , that what comes through best in their performances is heart breaking . these characters really do care about each other . it 's a great film to show to kids who are reaching pre-teen adolescence .
many of the criticisms on this thread seem to pick a comparison of this film with `` the mortal storm '' or `` casablanca '' . everyone is entitled to compare films they choose , but the similarities of `` the mortal storm '' and `` watch on the rhine '' are clearly the problems of refugees threatened by the nazi juggernaut , while the main comparative point brought out with `` casablanca '' is the seeming unjust treatment of humphrey bogart in 1943 by the academy of motion picture arts and science , because they chose paul lukas instead for the best actor oscar . it does not strike me as totally wrong . lukas had a good career in film ( both here and in england - he is the villain in `` the lady vanishes '' ) , and this performance was his best one . bogart had more great performances in him than rick blaine ( for instance , he was ignored for sam spade in `` the maltese falcon '' and roy earle in `` high sierra '' two years earlier , both of which were first rate performances , and he would not get an oscar for his greatest performances as fred c. dobbs in `` the treasure of sierra madres '' , the writer/murder suspect in `` in a lonely place '' , and captain philip francis queeg in `` the caine mutiny '' afterward - he got it for charley in `` the african queen '' ) . i think that bogie should have got it for the role of dobbs , but it did not happen . but lukas was lucky - he got it on the defining performance of his lesser career . few can claim that . to me the film to look at with `` watch on the rhine '' is based on another play/script by hellman , `` the searching wind '' . they both look at america 's spirit of isolationism in the 1920s and 1930s . `` the searching wind '' is really looking at the whole inter-war period , while `` watch on the rhine '' , set in the years just proceeding our entry into world war ii , deals with a few weeks of time . therefore it is better constructed as a play , and more meaningful for it 's impact . the film has many good performances , led by lukas as the exhausted but determined anti-nazi fighter/courier , davis as his loyal wife ( wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to lukas being the center of the play 's activities ) , coulouris as the selfish , conniving , but ultimately foolish and ineffective teck , lucille watson as the mother of davis and geraldine fitzgerald ( as coulouris ' wiser and sadder and fed up wife ) , and kurt katch , who delivers a devastating critique ( as the local embassy 's gestapo chief ) about coulouris and others who would deal with the nazis . it has dialog with bite in it . and what it says is quite true . it also has moments of near poetry . witness the scene , towards the end , when coulouris is left alone with lukas and davis , and says , `` the new world has left the scene to the old world '' . hellman could write very well at times . given the strength of the film script and performances i would rate this film highly among world war ii films .
this is just a short comment but i stumbled onto this movie by chance and i loved it . the acting is great , the story is simple and touching , and the lines , especially from the 4-yr-old desi , are so cute and sad . seek it out .
i watched the movie while recovering from major surgery . while i knew it was only a `` b '' film , a space western , i loved it . it may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non-the-less held my imagination and provided great escapism . sadly our society has so much available , discounting small attempts is too easy . in the same way that i can enjoy a even a grade school performance of shakespeare , i can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake . i am a cop and found affinity with the retired lapd . dreams like his haunt me that i will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another 's life ( or my own ) . while it was a romantic ending where farnsworth did take out the bad guy ( predictable ) i needed a little happy romance where good can triumph . my world is really too cynical .
i have seen the perfect son about three times . i fail to see how this film is a gay film , i am not even gay , but i do n't see it as a gay film . it is a film with a gay character , i ca n't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay . i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death , the death of someone who is your kin . i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life . i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving , ryan states that he does n't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone . is n't that horrific and sad ? i highly recommend the film .
i loved it , having been a fan of the original series , i have always wondered what the back story would be - it did n't fail to delight me . i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i did n't recognise one person - this is refreshing , much like bsg . it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - ca n't wait for the series to start airing . well done to ronald d. moore and team - excellent job . the special effects , dialogue and acting were all spot on , and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment , but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi stuff produced in the last decade .
soylent green is a classic . i have been waiting for someone to re-do it.they seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days ( i.e . war of the worlds ) and i am hoping some director/producer will re-do soylent green . with todays computer animation and technology , it would have the potential to be a great picture . anti-utopian films may not be that far-fetched . the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it . we , as humans , have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand , but there 's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves . despite all the diseases , wars , abortions , birth control , etc . the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish . classic malthusian economics states that any species , including humans , will multiply beyond their means of subsistence . 6 billion and growing .... that 's obscene .
somewhat funny and well-paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless , fast-talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding u.s. treasury agent ( david morse ) to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief/hacker ( doug hutchinson ) , who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead . `` bait '' marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua ( `` the replacement killers '' ) and he handles the task fairly well even though it does n't top his first movie . what the two films have in common is the action sequences , which are flat-out excellent . foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning , but throughout the film , i began to catch on . hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in `` marathon man '' . morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost .
show favorites green arrow ( introduced this season ) , aquaman ( introduced in season 5 ) , `` impulse '' ( season 4 ) , and cyborg ( season 5 ) all come together , along with clark , to stop one of lex 's evil plans in this thrilling mid-season episode . through his sophisticated technology , green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on . green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry ( aqua ) , bart allen ( impulse ) and victor stone ( cyborg ) to stop lex and destroy these facilities . after recruiting clark to help , the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local laboratory . this episode is incredible . full of action , humor , and fabulous dialog , it feels more like a movie . it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season .
most movies about , or set in , new orleans , turn out to be laughably bad , and laughably inaccurate ( examble : remember `` the savage bees '' ? but i 'll make an exception for `` tightrope '' , which almost got it right ) . here 's one that does n't inevitably get it wrong . the accents are not too bad ( yes , the `` yat '' accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern ) , the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was , without the obligatory `` tourist '' shots , and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a `` quirky southerner '' . one of the few films to do justice to this city , and a good film to boot ..
i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months . i was actually surprised at how good it was . the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty . they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned . a few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party . later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well . at the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . but , marty is in the hospital with severe burns . although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the pranks apparently did happen . the acting is terrible but that is fine . i love the story . i really sympathize with marty . it 's like tamara ( 2005 ) . the bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge . i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers . i give this movie 8 stars out of 10 . good cheesy slasher !
my observations : vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful , exotic and fantastic . jeanette wore it well , and got even with naive nelson . boat crashing into his balcony served him right . costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well , especially by today 's standards . 1942 costume designer did great job . main song theme just lovely . caution to negative posters : 1942 was time of ww ii ; pearl harbor happened year before . u.s. just coming out of great depression ; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing , dance and yes , fantastic fantasy . despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl , snuffing out freedoms . thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend . movie going was a privileged treat , in those depressing times . when you , negative posters , become actors or even movie stars , then you have room to talk and criticize . jeanette 's and nelson 's movies stand the test of time . angel wings wonderful , on the real angel . rl wings at costume party not so hot , but great on jeanette considering the sl . beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson , as always . jeanette dancing was a pure delight . 15/10
my , kasi lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman . this film is a lost gem , a dead-on satire `` mockumentary '' of the early 90 's hip hop scene , when mc hammer had just began to fade away into that good night . we follow the three members of the nwh as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame . and like nickolas nickleby , at the end , they finish their journey not far from where they started , but at least a little wiser and lot less naive . this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of , but it 's the kind of film you either love or hate , a lot like `` company man '' in this regard . i regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate new york : it 's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself .
i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film , you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine , a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding . dan in real life delivered that promise . the film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss . with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche , their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys . the cast , sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead .
this is not my favorite wip ( `` women in prison '' ) , but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre . it is was produced by roger corman , who at this point had already produced a few wips . it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula . the movie takes place in an usa prison , not in a `` banana republic '' like most wip films . i 'm not sure if that was a wise move , but it is an acceptable change of pace . writer-director demme really gets into his job , always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario . in fact , he is a little too ambitious for his own good . the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick . but do not worry , demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre . there is plenty of nudity and violence , something that will satisfy hardcore fans . the film is a little slow , but it is very entertaining . the cast is good . roberta collins is a wip veteran , so she does not need an introduction , and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden . pam grier is sorely missed , though .
to all of yall who think 1.this was a boring telecast 2.halle berry and denzel washington did not deserve their oscars shut the f * * k up ! ! this was one of the best academy awards show because 1.it was a moment in history to have a black yes `` black actress '' win an academy award for best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years.to be honest i had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees.to me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back.the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg alfre woodard , whoopi goldberg , diana ross , mary jean babtise , but it did not 2.halle berry deserved that oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge ! but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows.as for mr washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for malcomx.to all of you who think race is not an issue '' probably white people '' in the movie industry , well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence '' angela basset '' . i do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it.come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it
a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother , `` saving grace '' seems cut from the same cloth as a half-dozen other british comedies over the past two years ... underdog is faced with adversity , finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him/herself in the process . widowed and thus broke , grace is a master gardener , and is enlisted to help her friend/employee matthew grow his pot plant . he 's been doing it all wrong , so grace helps him out . they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot , which they can both benefit from . he enjoys smoking , she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage . highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise , dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in `` saturday night fever '' and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb . blethyn is always watchable , and you ca n't say that about a lot of people .. well , i ca n't , anyway . ferguson is very good , and tcheky karyo , who i liked in `` la femme nikita '' , is memorable . not profoundly moving or insightful , but immensely entertaining , and at a brisk 90 minutes , feels like a walk with friends . 8/10 .
this is a really strange film -- and that is not a bad thing . it is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless and a fairy tale . i 'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange , but i loved it . once again , this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people ( not actors ) and gets a great ensemble-type performance . although not nearly as sad as umberto d , both movies have a very similar point to make -- this one just does it in a very absurdist way . ignore the cheesy special effects -- after all , it was made in the early 1950s and special effects are n't terribly important anyway ( or at least they should n't be in films ) . instead , just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride . unless you are a total curmudgeon , you 'll have a ball . by the way , since i first reviewed this film , i have seen another desica directed film that is an absolute must-see and that is the children are watching us . while not a fantasy or light in spirit like miracle in milan , a great film nevertheless .
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet , evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man ( joe mantegna ) good . explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist ( lindsay crouse ) , it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences . the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamet 's films ( steven goldstein , jack wallace , ricky jay , andy potok , allen soule , william h. macy ) , and they do their usual good job . i loved lindsay crouse in this film , and have often wondered why she did n't become a more noted player than she has become . perhaps i 'm not looking in the right places ! the movie proceeds at a slow pace , with flat dialog , yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending . you 'd expect a real let down at the ending , but i found it uplifting and satisfying . i love this movie !
as an anti-football person , i ( on the surface ) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film , although secretly i hoped it might be east is east ii . the trailers looked fun so i thought i 'd give it a go . it took about ten minutes but after that i was glued to the screen , and that was n't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium . the acting was fresh and vibrant , the characters engaging , and the jokes genuinely funny . the entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so . football fan or no football fan , sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love , friendship , family , independence and rivalry . add a dash of sikh culture and you have the formula for the best british comedy i 've seen in a long time , dare i say it .... better than east is east . this film trots along nicely at a lovely pace , never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished , keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged . though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film , there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things do n't always happen as you would expect . saying that , there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers . i suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted/let down by the ending . personally , if there was any other outcome i would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers . as for the actors , i would have to say that juliet stevenson ( paula ) put in the finest performance . i never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do ! prize for the most unconvincing ( of the main characters ) goes , unfortunately , to kiera knightley ( jules ) , but do n't get me wrong , even she offered a great performance , it 's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera , this time you 're it . tip : do n't leave before the credits . once the lights came back up i realised to my horror that perhaps i should n't have watched this film after all . my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice . oh , what am i saying , it was absolutely brill and i ca n't recommend it enough . i will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos . i 'm a student . i only splash out if it 's really worth it .
i had no idea what jane eyre was before i saw this miniseries . i had read and watched many classics before , and i believed that most classics were boring , over-worded , and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best . this jane eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions . zelah clarke is a fabulous actress , and she gives a wonderful portrayal of jane eyre . her accent is delightful and her quiet , yet firm nature matches the young governess ' character exactly . timothy dalton is an amazing rochester . his passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of thornfield hall . i could n't sleep at all the night after i had watched this miniseries . the plot is both haunting and inspiring . the characters are masterfully performed , and the story is incredible . this is the best version of jane eyre to ever appear on film . i read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed charolette bronte 's writing . jane eyre is now my favorite film and book . if you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life , watch the 1983 bbc version of jane eyre .
jim carrey can do anything . i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie , and it totally was not . it was so incredibly funny for everyone , adults & kids . i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres , and now it 's finally coming out on dvd this tuesday and i 'm way to excited , as you can see . you should definitely see it if you have n't already , it was so great ! liz
`` tulip '' is on the `` australian all shorts '' video from `` tribe first rites '' showcasing the talents of first time directors . i wish more scripts had such excellent dialogue . i hope rachel griffiths has more stories to tell , she does it so well .
british comedies tend to fall into one of two main types : the quiet , introspective , usually romantic study and the farcical social satire . settings , characters , and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories . butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type . the scripts are very verbal , including long interior monologues by the main character ria , a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life . when she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman ( who makes his interest in her quite clear ) , she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered . the acting and scripts are always on the money , which makes one 's reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one : i was neither blown away by it nor turned off . my mother , on the other hand , adored this show . i think the degree to which one identifies with ria 's dilemma is the most important factor in determining one 's reaction to butterflies .
a heartwarming film . the usual superb acting by john thaw , who passed over recently . a man who was always so unassuming . he was one of englands top 10 actors certainly of my time . he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse . as jack regan in the 1970 's hit tv series 'the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc . a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection . the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings . the interaction between the two main characters.tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian .
popular radio storyteller gabriel no one ( robin williams , scraggy and speaking in hushed , hypnotic tones ) becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteen-year-old boy from wisconsin named pete logand ( rory culkin ) , who has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents . to boot , pete has aids and this compels gabriel further still , since his partner jess ( bobby cannavale , good ) happens to be a survivor of hiv himself . he also acquaints himself with pete 's guardian , a woman named donna ( toni collette , brilliant ! ) and when gabriel decides he wants to meet and talk to the two of them in person and goes to wisconsin , he discovers some secrets he was ( naturally ) not prepared to find . based on real events that happened to armistead maupin ( who co-wrote the screenplay with terry anderson ) and directed by patrick stetner , this film moves a lot faster ( 90 min. , maybe a few minutes longer ) than one might think a movie of this genre would run . that 's good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear . it 's bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and does n't sew-up any of the plot openings or back-story . i 'd rather not go into any great detail except to say that , if you are not familiar with mr.maupin 's works or his personal story , you feel a little bit out of the loop here . still , the performances by williams ( i would 've loved to heard more of his narration , personally ) , collette , cannavale , culkin and much of the supporting cast ( the waitress at the restaurant collete 's donna frequents does a great job with what small part she has ! ) are top-notch and the mood established here -- namely , the chilly , lonely dark exteriors of wisconsin and new york -- give a terrific framing for this story . it may have ends that do n't tie together particularly well , but it 's still a compelling enough story to stick with .
just came out of a sneak preview for this film . it had me laughing every 30 secs . the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i had n't bought that large coke . there are definitely some lulls , but , overall , highly entertaining . the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in `` bruce almighty '' and will ferrell `` anchorman : the legend of ron burgendy '' in their movies . paul rudd is hilarious as always . i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas ( like p.s. ) . i think that seth rogen should be getting more work , because he so freaking talented and engaging . leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments . i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac . however , if you 're easily offended , do n't see this movie . if you 're a rabid feminist , do n't see this movie . and , please , not matter what , even if you think you 're one of those `` hip '' parents , do n't take your kids to this movie . sure , you should let your teens go see this movie , just do n't watch it with them . it would make for some incredibly awkward moments .
i 've watched it plenty of times and i 'm planning on buying the full feature . i love all of jason steele 's comedy . it 's very different and unique and is very enjoyable . i love indie films and this one is just great . the plot is strange but very funny . this short film is about a talking spatula named edward . the order of the events are a bit jumbled , making this film very interesting to watch . at first you see edward fighting the spoons , but then the focus changes to earlier in his life . this is a silly movie , but of course , it 's still great . i highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com . it 's very funny . the humour may not match everybody 's taste but watch anyway . it 'll only take 16 minutes of your time , and it 's free . go watch spatula madness !
you better see this episode from the beginning , because if you start to watch it any later , you will be confused as to what is happening to clark 's life . yet , that is the twist ; clark is stuck in an alternate reality . lana is devoted to him . lex lost most of his legs and is in a wheelchair due to the bridge accident when he swerved to miss clark in the pilot of the series . martha is married to lionel . about the only constant is his most loyal friend chloe , who still believes in who he is . and , oh yeah , he does n't have any superpowers . he is in a mental institution for putting himself in a fantasy world where he does have powers , and is ridiculed for believing so . aside from chloe , there is one mysterious figure who believes in clark : a black man who in the alternate reality is also a resident of the institution , who believes he is from mars . clark must stay true to everything he believes is actual reality , and not get brainwashed by the institution 's psychiatrist , who is in fact the fourth phantom zone escapee . this episode is utterly mind-blowing and shocking . plus , it provides a fresh twist from the usual type of `` smallville '' episode .
believe it or not , at 12 minutes , this film ( for 1912 ) is a full-length film . very , very few films were longer than that back then , but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest ! no , what 's different is that all the actors ( with the exception of one frog ) are bugs ... yes , bugs ! this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin , laurel and hardy or max linder but instead this russian production uses bugs ( or , i think , models that looked just like bugs ) . chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume linder was busy , so perhaps that 's why they used bugs ! using stop-motion , the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly well -- and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later ! the film starts with mr. beetle sneaking off for a good time . he goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home . but , unfortunately for mr. beetle , he is caught on camera by a local film buff . plus , he does n't know it but mrs. beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter . of course , there 's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this , but the plot is age-old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike . weird but also very amazing and watchable .
there are other reviews here so i do n't need to say how great it is or what it 's about ... my point is : i heard about this movie ages ago , before it was shown . i ca n't even remember how , i just know it was through the internet . the distributors went under before it ever hit ! for months i moped and complained . please note that on this page there 's a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazon.com in germany . you can use alta vista 's babelfish to translate . i know it 's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there 's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that 's also been dubbed in german , but as hilarious and campy as this film is , it really only makes it funnier ! if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions it 's so worth it ! it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u.s. from germany . trust me , it might seem like a lot to spend on a film , but if you 're into corny b-flicks you 'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends !
let 's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it 's time the original battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . lorne greene was great as adama and richard hatch was perfect as apollo and dirk benedict was funny as starbuck , but i dare say , not as pretty as katee as starbuck . i loved the episode with the pegasus and greetings from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar , war of the gods , the best was experiment in terra , i thought that was a tribute in a way to heaven can wait , then you had the women of battlestar , not to compare them to let 's say tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as number six , but jane seymour 's beauty could not be compared to . let alone loerrta spang as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . i loved the original as much as the new . can you imagine if john calicos had a number six ? : ) thankyou for listening .
love it or loathe it , it 's hard to not find warren beatty 's take on `` dick tracy , '' the 1990 film adaptation of chester gould 's famous comic strip , anything short of a genre classic . superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years , and may soon become a genre all on its own . beatty 's film liberally uses gould 's source material to full effect , shooting in all six of the strip 's primary colors , and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose , seductive women a lush visual style and tone . it can be stated that the film 's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities , which i do n't think can be any further from the truth . `` dick tracy '' relishes in its look and ghastly characters , and beatty himself , who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title , is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs . other than the visual treats and oscar-winning makeup , there is a plot , and big boy caprice ( al pacino , deliciously over-the-top in an oscar-nominated performance ) , seeks to eliminate tracy in one well-planned move , but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him . tracy , meanwhile , is juggling his relationship with tess trueheart ( glenne headly ) , who as her name would have it , remains faithfully by his side and cares for the kid ( charlie korsmo ) , who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero . tracy 's fidelity to tess is tested by the tempting advances of breathless mahoney ( madonna ) , who is also big boy 's main squeeze . at the same time that all of this is going down , things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town , and decides to play both sides against the middle . the performances are good , as beatty 's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material , as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects . pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that 's truly standout from the rest . `` dick tracy '' is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre . i think that if chester gould was still alive , he would be proud of warren beatty 's take on his beloved crime-fighting detective . 8/10
i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie .... except when the bras and bullets started flying . i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone .... but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep . i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics . also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat . if i 'm correct ralph bashki did that movie too.it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family , streets , jobs , etc . when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out . because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter . ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt . heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man .
well , magic works in mysterious ways . this movie about 4 prisoners , trying to escape with the help of spells , written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense . even if it had something of a theater-play ( almost everything happens in the cell ) it never got boring and it was acted very well . in the tradition of `` cube '' you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal , you developed some sympathy with some of them , only to change your mind by the twists the story takes . some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air . altogether intense and entertaining and as i did n't expect anything ( a friend rented it ) , it was a positive surprise !
the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again . an early sammo film that has him imitating his character 's hero , bruce lee , sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting . the way he slips into bruce 's style and then back to his own , more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art . throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy ( some unintentional , like the fake black guy ) , action and some incredible fight scenes . a great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone 's time .
i thought this movie was really really great because , in india cinemas nowadays , all you see is skin , music , and bad acting ... in this movie , you can see some tradition , ethnicity , and at least some decency ... although some parts were a little dramatic , guess what ? that is what indian cinema is all about ! after watching this movie , at least you do n't get a headache from all the loud overrated music , or any violence , its just the truth , it teaches about love , and of course caring for the person you love throughout life ... i think it was an amazing movie ... kids can watch it without a doubt , and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india 's sure profoundness ... until all these rap hits , miniskirts , and skin showing became a part of it .
finally , timon and pumbaa in their own film ... 'the lion king 1 1/2 : hakuna matata ' is an irreverent new take on a classic tale . which classic tale , you ask ? why , 'the lion king ' of course ! yep , if there 's one thing that disney is never short of , it 's narcissism . but that does n't mean that this is n't a good film . it 's basically the events of 'the lion king ' as told from timon and pumbaa 's perspective . and it 's because of this that you 'll have to know the story of 'the lion king ' by heart to see where they 're coming from . anyway , at one level i was watching this and thinking `` oh my god this is so lame ... '' and on another level i was having a ball . much of the humour is predictable - i mean , when pumbaa makes up two beds , a big one for himself and a small one for timon , within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one . but that does n't stop it from being hilarious , which , imo , is 'hakuna matata ' in a nutshell . it 's not what happens , it 's how . and a note of warning : there are also some fart jokes . seriously , did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage ? but as fart jokes go , these are especially good , and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur . the returning voice talent is great . i 'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return , what with most of them only having two or three lines ( if they 're lucky ) . whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome . the music is also great . from 'digga tunnah ' at the start to 'that 's all i need ' , an adaption of 'warthog rhapsody ' ( a song that was cut from 'the lion king ' and is frankly much improved in this incarnation ) , the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever . in the end , timon and pumbaa are awesome characters , and while it may be argued that 'hakuna matata ' is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it . it 's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with . am i starting to sound creepy ? either way , 'the lion king 1 1/2 ' is great if you 've seen 'the lion king ' far too many times . especially if you are right now thinking `` do n't be silly , there 's no such thing as seeing 'the lion king ' too many times ! ''
it may be the remake of 1987 autumn 's tale after eleven years , as the director mabel cheung claimed . mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life , in which love , desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles . rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment , and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one . the director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music . the love between father and son , lovers , and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance . mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all , instead , she tries to reproduce a true life on screen , making huge efforts of years ' working on this project and gathering information in beijing underground pubs . daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far . his innate dispiritedness and reticence fit the blue mood of the film perfectly .
more eeriness and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von trier 's fantastic horror satire the kingdom ... much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more . plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role ...
if the themes of the girl from missouri sound familiar it should . that 's because anita loos who wrote the screenplay here also wrote the classic gentlemen prefer blondes . unlike marilyn monroe in that film , jean harlow will accept any kind of jewelry from men of means . and it 's men of means that jean harlow is after . she leaves the road side hash house run by her mother and stepfather because she 's decided that the best way to gain the easy life is to marry it . her talents as a chorus girl are limited , but she 'll be able to trade in on that beauty . her odyssey starts with her and friend patsy kelly getting an invitation to perform at a party thrown by millionaire lewis stone . but unbeknownst to jean , stone 's just having a wild last fling before doing himself because of the moneys he owes not owns . still she wrangles a few baubles from him that fellow millionaire lionel barrymore notices . lionel 's amused by it until jean sets her sights on his playboy son , franchot tone . after that he is not amused and he looks to shake jean from climbing the family tree . the girl from missouri went into production mid adaption of the code so it went under peculiar censorship . i 've a feeling we would have seen a much more risqué film . still jean harlow as a younger and sassier version of mae west is always appreciated . what a great comic talent that woman had , seeing the girl from missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later . ironically enough the casting of patsy kelly with harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde , thelma todd . harlow and kelly have the same easy chemistry between that patsy had with thelma . todd would also die a year later in a freak accident/suicide/homicide that no satisfactory explanation has ever really been given . do n't miss the girl from missouri , it 's bright and sassy , must be from all that sparkling jewelry .
i just saw this film at the 2001 toronto international film festival . the working title there was 'dog days ' . the audience reaction was mixed . some people found the graphic sex and realistic violence to be too much for them . others seemed to genuinely appreciate how good this film was . this film is n't for the faint of heart . it 's like 'happiness ' with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity . there 's animal poisoning , a strip-tease from a senior citizen , an orgy'esque ' bathouse in a shopping centre , anal candle penetration , and the molestation of the mentally incompetent . if any of this sounds like too much to handle then this film is n't for you . this film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic . the banality of our existence is shoved in our face with utmost glee . seidl has no interest in redeeming humanity here . and why should he ? this film features excellent performances from all involved , is always interesting , and is probably the most intelligent social statement to be made on film in awhile .
theo robertson has commented that waw did n't adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitler 's rise and wwii . perhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 ? covers this period , and together with the earlier volumes in the series , shows clearly the existing conditions , i feel . a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period , joined the hitler youth even , and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in waw . this documentary is so far above the history channel 's documentaries i also own , that there is no comparison . the only fault , and it is a small one , that i have with waw is this : the numbers are not included , many times . for instance , if you 're talking about lend-lease , then how much war material was lent/leased ? how much to russia , how much to britian ? how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink , and when ? how many ships did the german or japanese navy have , total , in 1941 ? what type were they ? how many troops ? how many troops did the allies have , in total , and by country ? lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off , but i would have preferred more ! and naturally , i always want to see more military analysis . like why did n't patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini , after they had it surrounded , instead of racing monty to rome , and letting it escape ? i do n't think you can begin to understand war until you 've seen some of these video segments on `` total war '' , like the fire bombing of dresden . it 's like trying to understand auschwitz , etc. , before you see the clips of the death camps : you just ca n't wrap your head around it - it 's too unbelievable . unknown at that time , and of course , unfilmed , were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese , including cannibalism , ( read `` flyboys '' ) , and some live vivisection of medical `` experimentation '' prisoners , w/o any anesthetic ! dave
easily the greatest low budget horror film of all time . i first saw this movie when i was around nine years of age , and i have to say that it scared the hell out of me . now that i 'm all growed up , however , i see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius . everyone , or at least everyone with any taste , has dreamed of seeing a snowman going around killing people , even if they wo n't admit it . i have always found something genuinely frightening about snowmen , so naturally , for a horror junkie such as myself , thismovie was a dream come true . some people say that this movie is silly , or otherwise void of any intelligence ... it 's a movie about a serial killer snowman , what the hell did you expect ? anyone who gave this film a low score is obviously too uptight to sit back and have a good laugh at stupid one-liners and cheap gore . i love this movie for what it is , a comedy , and until the movie industry wises up and makes a serious horror flick about a killer snowman ( which seems impossible , unfortunately ) i will forever hold this great piece of indie horror close to my heart .
my school 's drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002 , and i can only hope we 're as good as this ! i watched this film recently as sort of `` research '' for my role ( rosie alvarez ) , and i 'd just like to say , vanessa williams is the coolest ! wow ! the casting for this movie was right-on ( with one exception ) . jason alexander , oh my gawd , is there anything he ca n't do ? he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever - i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during `` put on a happy face ! '' he is so great ! vanessa williams , as i said before , is the coolest . she was a beautiful rosie , and her transition from secretary to seductress was totally believable . tyne daly was hilarious as albert 's obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr. mcafee ( however i loved paul lynde 's performance in the 1963 version ! ) . brigitta dau cracked me up as ursula merkle ; she really hammed it up ! and marc kudisch was an awesome conrad birdie ... '' suffer ! '' there was only one casting that i did n't understand , and , as you 'll see from previous comments , many other people did n't understand . chynna phillips as kim mcafee - what was that ? i mean she 's really pretty and very talented , but ... she looks a bit too old for the role . eh , maybe i 'm delusional . okay well anyways , i highly recommend this movie . it 'll leave you smiling !
when i was young i had seen very few movies . my parents in all their wisdom rented this one . i was very wary of what the movie was about , in fact i was n't even allowed to watch it . my brother and sister got to of course and this made me very angry . so what did i do ? late at night i trashed the vcr ! kicked the screen of the tv in and called the police and reported vandals . i was arrested of course , i was unable to get my foot out of the tv set before the police arrived . i was only given a stern talking to and sent home . my parents grounded me of course and made me work to repay the debt for the tv and vcr . this tore me apart , slave labour really sucks believe me , but i had to do it . chores all around the house . what happened in the end ? we got a big screen tv , dvd player and a surround sound system for my work . how did i get the money ? easy i made movies of my own and sold them to disney ! do you remember finding neno ? well i wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks ! they rewrote the plot of course and did it in cgi because they could n't afford to make it a real life action picture like i had done ! in the end i never saw the film the head that did n't die and the rating i gave it is my life rating ! it 's doing pretty good !
the film version of alice walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel ( written largely as letters from the central character celie to god ) was a massive oscar success , and rightly so . in the role of the abused and awakened celie , whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles . not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia , the fiery woman tamed by fate . others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page - danny glover as albert , celie 's abusive husband ; margaret avery as shug , a force of change for the good ; willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak ; susan beaubian as corrine , the preacher 's wife ; and the much-missed carl anderson ( otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar ) as preacher samuel . beautifully paced and sensitively written , 'the color purple ' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama .
ok - as far as the 2 versions of this movie . there were 2 people involved in the making - john korty and bill couterie ( george was just the producer - he really did n't have any kind of say so in the film - just helped with money ) - the 'adult ' version was made possible by bill couterie . john korty did n't like or approve this version ( as it was done behind his back ) . thanks to ladd films going under , they did n't advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for `` the right stuff '' , hoping it would pull them through ; ... and it did n't . so , this movie never really had a chance . when `` twice '' made it to cable ( hbo ) - they showed the reels with bill 's version and john threatened to sue if it was shown anymore ( did you notice how the 'adult ' version was n't on for very long ? ) . showtime got the 'clean ' version . the version on the videotape and laser-disc is the version approved by john ( who holds more power than bill ) . it 's a pity , really , as the 'adult ' version is actually better and does make more sense . but it 's very doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto dvd ( or any other format short of bootleg ) . sorry to disappoint everyone . i know all this info as i used to be the president of the twice upon a time fan club ( still have numerous items from the movie - used to own a letter-boxed version of the 'adult ' version , but it was stolen - only have a partial hbo copy of it now ) . 8 stars to the 'adult ' version - 5 to the 'clean ' version . any other questions , just ask .
ironically the most talked-about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98 % in spanish . the extra-long film 's controversy began at the cannes festival . there were love-hate notices , and considerable doubts about commercial prospects . as consolation the star , benicio del toro , got the best actor award there . i 'm talking about steven soderbergh 's 'che , ' of course . that 's the name it 's going by in this version , shown in new york as at cannes in two 2-hour-plus segments without opening title or end credits . 'che ' is certainly appropriate since ernesto `` che '' guevara is in almost every scene . del toro is impressive , hanging in reliably through thick and thin , from days of glorious victory in part one to months of humiliating defeat in part two , appealing and simpatico in all his varied manifestations , even disguised as a bald graying man to sneak into bolivia . it 's a terrific performance ; one wishes it had a better setting . if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours , with an intermission between the two sections , there are rewards . there 's an authentic feel throughout -- fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish ( though some of the actors , oddly enough in the english segments especially , are wooden ) . you get a good outline of what guerrilla warfare , che style , was like : the teaching , the recruitment of campesinos , the morality , the discipline , the hardship , and the fighting -- as well as che 's gradual morphing from company doctor to full-fledged military leader . use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality red `` digital high performance cine camera '' that just became available in time for filming enabled dp peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold , but at times still sing , and are always sharp and smooth . the film is in two parts -- soderbergh is calling them two `` films , '' and the plan is to release them commercially as such . first is 'the argentine , ' depicting che 's leadership in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of havana in the late 50 's , and the second is 'guerrilla , ' and concerns che 's failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to spearhead a revolution , a fruitful mission that led to guevara 's capture and execution in 1967 . the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and , i think , shot first . producer laura bickford says that part two is more of a thriller , while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes . yes , but both parts have a lot in common -- too much -- since both spend a large part of their time following the guerrillas through rough country . guerrilla an unmitigated downer since the bolivian revolt was doomed from the start . the group of cubans who tried to lead it did n't get a friendly reception from the bolivian campesinos , who suspected foreigners , and thought of the cuban communists as godless rapists . there is a third part , a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of che 's speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time , but that is inter-cut in the first segment . the first part also has fidel and is considerably more upbeat , leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the dictatorship of fulgencio batista in cuba . during 'guerilla ' i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european-style miniseries , which might begin with a shortened version of walter salles 's 'motorcycle diaries ' and go on to take us to guevara 's fateful meeting with fidel in mexico and enlistment in the 26th of july movement . there could be much more about his extensive travels and diplomatic missions . this is far from a complete picture of the man , his childhood interest in chess , his lifelong interest in poetry , the books he wrote ; even his international fame is only touched on . and what about his harsh , cruel side ? really what soderbergh is most interested in is n't che , but revolution , and guerrilla warfare . the lasting impression that the 4+ hours leave is of slogging through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the tyranny of the rich . someone mentioned being reminded of terrence malick 's 'the tin red line , ' and yes , the meandering , episodic battle approach is similar ; but 'the thin red line ' has stronger characters ( hardly anybody emerges forcefully besides che ) , and it 's a really good film . this is an impressive , but unfinished and ill-fated , effort . this 8-years-gestating , heavily researched labor of love ( how many more ocean 's must come to pay for it ? ) is a vanity project , too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries . radical editing -- or major expansion -- would have made it into something more successful , and as it is it 's a long slog , especially in the second half . it 's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down , though it 's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken -- but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one .
in the '70s , charlton heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality . `` soylent green '' is one of the better ones . he plays robert thorn , a detective in 2022 new york . in this future , most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called soylent green . but when thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product , he finds himself on the run . i guess that it 's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays . but even so , it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture . also starring leigh taylor-young , chuck connors , brock peters , joseph cotten and edward g. robinson ( in his final role ) .
fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition , especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days . as has already been pointed out , this is hardly a real zombie film , but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers . while there are necessarily some bloody scenes , there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented ( feel-good 50s style ) , i ca n't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido & his fellow sufferers . while the cast is generally good , i felt that moss and nelson stood out . the humor is not in-your-face , but rather subdued ; there 's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie . this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema , but it does n't strive to be - instead , currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy .
actually , the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves . c.g . and special cameras -- assisted by imax -- incredibly display the inner ( and outer ) workings of an average human , be it adult men and women , boys and girls , or babies . nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed : digestion , reproduction ( featuring a marvin gaye hit ) , the heart , etc . some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the brain 's impulses look . it is amazing how we function . the subject matter skips around an awful lot . but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be * required * to know .
if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this is n't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . in fact you 'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect , beauty and soul of powell and pressburger 's masterpiece . the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . raf bomber command lost 58,000 men during the war , the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far , far smaller pool of active combatants , there 's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you 'd lost a relative during the conflict you 'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . when richar attenborough 's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who did n't survive the war . also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates . it 's obvious nazis do n't go to heaven the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court would n't have had much appeal to me if it was n't for the subtext , you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it 's replaced by american ambitions . there 's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture . one is the ethnic mix of america , even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51 % of americans are `` white european `` . the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess `` i am an american `` as peter is judged by abraham farlan , an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence . as for the `` special relationship `` between britain and america - what special relationship ? powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america . they obviously know their future too so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . it 's strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it 's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq ?
greetings again from the darkness . how rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain . adam sandler stars as charlie , a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy , and has since lost his career , his reason to live and arguably , his sanity . don cheadle co-stars as sandler 's former dental school roommate who appears to have the perfect life ( that sandler apparently had prior to 9/11 ) . of course the parallels in these men 's lives are obvious , but it is actually refreshing to see men 's feelings on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge , that is . watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt . writer/director mike binder ( `` the upside of anger '' , and sandler 's accountant in this film ) really brings a different look and feel to the film . some of the scenes do n't work as well as others , but overall it is well written and solidly directed . sandler and cheadle are both excellent . sandler 's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in `` punch drunk love '' , but here he brings much more depth . cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle . support work is excellent by jada pinkett smith ( as cheadle 's wife ) , liv tyler ( as a very patient psychiatrist ) , saffron burrows ( in an oddly appealing role ) , donald sutherland as an irritated judge and melinda dillon and robert klein as sandler 's in-laws . the film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined . in addition to the interesting story and some great shots of nyc , you have to love any film that features vocals from chrissy hynde , bruce springsteen and roger daltrey ... as well as eddie vedder impersonating daltrey . not exactly a chipper upbeat film , but it is a quality film with an unusual story .
recap : it 's business as usual at louche 's casino in tanger . the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day . the owner louche and some staff leave for the night , leaving modesty in charge . suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino , shooting wildly . unknown to modesty , they have already killed louche , and are now after the money hidden in the vault . but no one present , and still alive , at the casino knows the code to open the vault . the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants ca n't blow the door as planned . suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters ' leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy . comments : this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise , as i have neither seen nor read any of it . the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified . foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot . sure , there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story . as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense-filled scene , is the game between modesty and miklos . it 's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character , and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time . someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv-series , and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such . but , i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done . i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action , instead i enjoyed this game , the history much more than a simple action movie . i think the two main stars , alexandra staden and nikolaj coaster-waldau did very well . staden especially portrays modesty very well , and really carries this confident and talented character . 7/10
this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a los angeles television station 's `` late show '' . the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture , and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape , nor is it ever shown on television ( apparently due to a prohibition by the estate of moss hart , the playwright/producer/director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii -- the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made ) . i did not see the movie again for over 30 years , when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a `` bootlegged '' copy on vhs ( poor video quality , but good audio ) . my memory of it was correct : it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch . an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars , just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 ) , went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well-known and fully-employed actors ( e.g . judy holliday , edmond o'brien , jeanne crain , barry nelson , don taylor , karl malden , peter lind hayes , george `` superman '' ) reeves , red buttons , lee j. cobb , kevin mccarthy , and gary merrill ) . the scenes with the b-24 liberators are terrific , especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant ( for those times ) 4-engine bomber ( then 18,000+ manufactured , now nearly extinct ) can be seen . good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot-cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew ( of course , very gender-biased as was the trend of the day : only the men became pilots , the women just supported them in their roles -- hardly acceptable in today 's world ) . i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy .
when i saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 1995 via a free advanced screening , i was totally enchanted and would have gladly paid to see it . i was sorry when i talked to many people afterwards who had also seen it and who were totally disappointed with it and how it ended . i , on the other hand , felt completely the opposite . i was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else . people i talked to said there was too much talking ! plus they were unhappy because they felt that the ending left you wondering about the fate of the two characters . i found these observations to be absurd and to also be painful evidence of how the majority of the american movie-going public seems to have a tendency to want easy-to-follow stories in films with not too much complex and intelligent dialogue lest they get confused . they also like to be spoon-fed tidy endings -- happy or sad . this disgusts me . nobody wants to be challenged anymore ? ? ? and as for the ending ( and i do n't want to be a spoiler ) , i am totally content because i know in my heart that these two characters will see each other again . it 's all about your own personal faith in romance and destiny . it 's a very personal film that does n't speak to all people . but it certainly spoke to me . give it a chance ! be patient with it ! richard linklater has crafted a very lovely film with a beautiful story set against the beautiful background of the city of vienna . watching it makes you feel as if you yourself are strolling through the city streets along with the characters . as if you yourself were tripping through europe on a eurail pass . it 's very intimate . plus , ethan hawke and julie delpy do an exquisite job of bringing the complex script to life . they must have improvised during some parts and it works well . they have a great chemistry in their roles . their awkwardness as strangers getting to know each other in the beginning is very believable and you can truly feel the romance and bonding develop between them as the movie progresses . i get the feeling that this was a very personal work for mr. linklater and i deeply respect him for getting this film made . it definitely touched me and i hope it touches others just as much . bravo for romance ! ! !
good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things . hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop that 's being minted by hollywood today . bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging . they do n't make movies like this any more .
just saying you 've got a movie about john holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen , but writer/director james cox delivers oh so much more . a `` rashamon '' of the sleazy hollywood set , the film splitters the july 1981 wonderland murders through a variety of angles ( and film stocks ) , but mostly through the filter of john holmes ' coked out weasel brain . in a film full of bad guys holmes is either the most vile , the most pathetic or both . several versions of the story emerge and merge as cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting . the dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false . while the film takes places two years after holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity , kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches . this sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center . those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown , not even at the climax , though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos . once again val kilmer as holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working . strutting , cringing , bragging or begging , kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck . stand out performances beside kilmer definitely include ted levine as the lead cop in the investigation and lisa kudrow as holmes estranged wife . the trio of criminals holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy josh lucas , the ever interesting timothy blake nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable dylan mcdermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders . cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about wonderland , there is always a worse version possible , but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth .
the running man is often dismissed as being just another arnie action thriller full of explosions , bad puns and gunfire , and to be fair , there is a lot of that in it . people used to look at it and compare it to the terminator series , saying it was one of the poorer schwarzenegger films . but , give it 18 years , and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light . rather than just being another brainless action film , it works very well as a parody of reality tv . it is quite different to the stephen king book , true , but i doubt whether hollywood , with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys ' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando , would have accepted it in its current form . but , on with the review . ben richards ( arnold schwarzenegger ) is a cop working in a dystopian united states where democracy is a thing of the past , and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation . the economy is in tatters , food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch , like jumping for dollars , where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs , and the most popular one is the running man , a gameshow hosted by the slimy damian killian ( played by the entertaining richard dawson ) where supposed 'criminals ' are hunted down by theatrical , pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers ' . some , however , try and speak up against the government . when a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of bakersfield , california , a helicopter piloted by richards is sent to 'calm ' ( i.e . kill ) the protest . when richards refuses to fire on innocent people , he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd . he is sentenced to a slave labour camp , but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader ( yaphet kotto ) and goes on the run . however , his freedom does not last long , and after he kidnaps network employee amber mendez ( marita conchita alonso ) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him , he finds himself taken prisoner again , but this time he is forced to appear on the running man . and there , of course , the entire film kicks into standard arnie mode . richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of los angeles ( why is la always destroyed in these dystopian worlds ? ) and forced to run from the 'stalkers ' , along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him . amber also becomes curious about richards ' protestations of innocence , and discovers he was framed . guess what happens to her , then ? so , as amber , richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers , we soon become aware that richards is no ordinary cop . he 's super arnie , the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in christmas lights all while being just your average american guy with an austrian accent . yes , the remainder of the film becomes dumb , loud , classic 80 's arnie fun . there 's a lot of exciting fight sequences , the trademark dreadful puns ( 'he had to split ' being my favourite ) , and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending . it 's a lot of fun watching killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome ' gameshow host way , as well , and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host ( watch out for the cursing old lady ! ) and the cold , cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings . if you expect a high-brow , intelligent film , you 'll be disappointed . but if you want a great 80s flick , well , this is it . but the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic . if you look at the entertainment we have today , you 'll have noticed the way reality tv is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame , and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on tv . it 's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile tv exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on tv . we 've already had that , however , with the ghoulish al-qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet . it seems that in the current climate , at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets . with that in mind , and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s , you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film . of course , we have n't reached there yet , as it 's terrorists , rather than the mainstream media , who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death , but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people 's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity ...
in 2054 paris , avalon , a computer generated system , controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped , detective karas ( craig ) must go against avalon to find her . renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many . pixar are the animation masters . their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch . renaissance is n't a film aimed for the young audience though , and like 2007 's persepolis , brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation . in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later , christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making . volckman 's picture however is a full on animation but it does n't half look realistic for the majority of it 's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time . the faces of the character 's are well portrayed and in particular , this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow . the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions . it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy , and is finely directed also . for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapi renaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood . one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot . the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen . the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we do n't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance . renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop 's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman , and then we see craig 's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements . there are many things wrong with the scripting , not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old , but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages .
why panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen : it 's much too smart , and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it , comparing it to american beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis , and sopranos and analyze this in it 's study of illegal goings-on amidst family life . though panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material , brommel 's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man . william h. macy stars as alex , a hitman who works for his father 's ( sutherland ) contract-killing business . he leads a double life , with his wife ( ullman ) and son unaware of his real trade . in his middle-age , he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life . under his calm , collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father 's controlling grasp on his life . when he meets a young woman ( campbell ) he feels invigored and decides it 's time to quit the family business . the fact that writer/director henry brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract-killing is disposable . he could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession ; his characters are so well-developed and believable , scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on macy 's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman . brommel 's script feels like a shakespearean tragedy , with a definite theme of destiny running throughout . in alex , macy creates a tragic , easily sympathetic character , and turns in yet another brooding , great performance , as can always be expected . donald sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father , and ullman 's dramatic turn as macy 's wife is a welcome change for the comedian . consider a scene in a bicycle shop , where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion . henry brommel 's first feature , panic is a film that is well-crafted in its sincerity . with a first-rate cast , a plausible script , terse dialogue , and nice direction , this character-study is hopefully just a taste of brommel 's aptness for creating characters that seem real . 8 out of 10
after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years , i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism , nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth . the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his `` unfinished '' pupil out to find the 5 past members of his poison clan , so they do not seek out a fortune which the master 's friend keeps hidden . afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training , he instructs him to befriend one of the five `` venoms '' so as to defeat the other four . i ca n't say enough about the choreography or the camera work . a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made . a classic ! !
updated version of a story that had been turned into the film in 1938 england ( return of the frog ) concerning the pursuit by the police of a master criminal known as the frog because of the frog like get up ( bulging eyes etc ) he wears . one of the good wallace films from the 1960 's it 's a solid little entertainment . clearly influenced by ( or did this influence ) the restart of the dr mabuse films , the frog seems to be more a super villain than a master thief . while not the best of the wallace films , it is worth a look . it would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film . between 6 and 7 out of 10 .
despite some reviews being distinctly luke-warm , i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'mills and boon ' , so what ? it is good to see a warm , touching story of real love in these cynical times . many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes . you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other , even though , for political reasons , it was an arranged marriage . i did feel though that sir john conroy , who was desperate to control the young queen , is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain . as it is rumoured that he was in fact , the real father of victoria ( as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent ) it would have been interesting to explore this theory . emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess , trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her . she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england , which prospered as never before , under her long reign . i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie .
great actors , an oscar nominee actress , stunning scenery , good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag ( and thats quite big ) . this film was brilliant . it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . .well , side splitting . i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much , and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the 'stoned ladies in the tea shop ' scene . well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year , if not of all time .
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i ca n't get it out of my head . i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done , and these four are excellent in their endeavors . some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we 'd never be able to do it in real life . i always learn something from the shows . but if you like mystery , drama , comedy , and a little forensic work you 'll love this show . it reminds me of quincy , me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other . they screw up a lot but they get the job done , and that 's what counts .
when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock , australia , lindy chamberlain ( meryl streep ) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press , and the whole thing turns into a circus . lindy does n't help matters either because she wo n't play to the jury or courtroom , she 's only herself , and she 's a tough nut to crack , so of course everyone thinks she 's guilty because there 's a piece of evidence that has n't come to light . sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain , a seventh-day adventist pastor , who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . it 's good ( or bad ) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too , because the australian public does n't believe the story and the media only fans the flames . eventually , lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor , but years later , a missing piece of evidence shows up and she 's freed , but not until after the family 's life is basically ruined . a heart-breaking story , very well done , a bit long but well worth seeing . 8 out of 10 .
i really liked batman : dead end , i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film . this trailer did n't quite give me the same impression . the story line , or potential story line , was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show . first , michael o'hearn is not that good a superman . i actually thought he , in his brief appearance , made a decent clark kent . sorry , i just do n't think of superman as being that buff . the suit kent wore masked his size . batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not superman . supes is toned no doubt but not bulk . anyway , i did n't care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy . now this may not be just o'hearn 's fault , collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction . second , the special effects for flying were cheezy . superman flies through the sky . if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground , with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him . i do n't think there were any full body shots of superman flying . evidently the harness and rigging supporting o'hearn must have been located on his lower torso . all in all it was a good trailer . i 'd probably pay to see a film , if ever made , and would be sure to catch it on television . the story line , an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries , superman jealous of lois 's attraction to wayne , lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman & superman is a good one . i 'm sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company , even o'hearn could deliver a decent film . certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately .
this is a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of the ancient hohokam indians . she takes a ( really fake looking ) mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it . well , pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy . and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy . even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman 's family . this is actually really boring , overall , and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it . but if you keep at it , you may just make it to the end . ahah ! what is the secret of the mummy ? is the mummy 's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave ? you may not be able to ascertain what the spirit 's motivation is , but if you like spooky shenanigans on a low-budget ( and 70 's hairstyles ! ) this will have a certain comforting appeal . the way i have described the story is much clearer than the jumbled , boring way the film lays the story out . can a boring movie really be fascinating ? well ... somehow this one achieves that . maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way . i do n't know . what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit , despite its dullness . fans of `` spider baby '' will be interested to know that a couple of music cues from that film are used in this one ( including an instrumental version of the theme song ) . featuring one frightening and fairly well-done sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper . other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky ; but this one scene is actually pretty scary . see this ! it 's weird and it 's worth your time . you might even want one on your shelf .
genteel , softly spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre . a departure from his normal adventure/fantasy fare , it paved the way for his 1993 success , `` schindler 's list '' . based upon alice walder 's pulitzer prize winning novel , the story concerns a young girl 's arranged marriage of hardship to a brutal , angry farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister nettie . while the plot - about compassion , abuse and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving , it loses its way through the fault of continuity and menno meyjes ' scrambling screenplay . `` the color purple '' is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little erratic in regard to time frame . this lapse in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss walker 's novel . a real shame that maestro spielberg was unable to pick out and rectify these problems , as most of the show is a wonderful example of his prowess as a director . performances are strong throughout , with whoopi goldberg making a debut - which she 's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment - as the heart broken celie who just yearns to be loved . danny glover lends solid support , though his `` moses '' was a superior turn for him in `` places in the heart '' . the standout showing comes from the unheralded oprah winfrey as miss sophia , the single minded , fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a patronising , upper class white woman . good support also from margaret avery , adolph caesar and rae dawn chong . quincy jones ( co-producer with spielberg , kathleen kennedy and frank marshall ) has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion . editing from michael kahn is sound as always , while director of photography allen daviau shows consummate skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery . this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye , it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions . wednesday , january 15 , 1997 - video
john travolta , the biggest honkeytonk in the world , and a mechanical bull ... what more can you ask for ! yeah , you 're probably not going to get many surprises or deep meaning in this one . yet , i have always found it fairly enjoyable to watch this redneck romance . bud ( travolta ) and sissy ( debra winger ) meet at gilley 's and fall in love . they have all the difficulties you might expect a hardcore redneck couple to have . the honkeytonk scenes are fun with dancing , mechanical bull riding , and -of course- the required brawls . it has a good , 1980 country soundtrack , featuring `` looking for love in all the wrong places '' , `` the devil went down to georgia '' , and `` hello texas '' by my favorite jimmy buffett . break out your cowboy boots and have a boot-scootin ' boogie ! * * * ( out of 4 )
well , i had seen `` they all laughed '' when it came out in europe around 1982 and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it . i 've just seen it again on tape , almost twenty years after ... bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also . excellent comedians and actors , good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing , too . i laughed and smiled all the time . just as we all do , at times . go get it .
the cult movie for every true russian intellectual . everything is brilliant , especially acting : it 's beyond any praise . the movie , as the book , is full of symbols : my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha ( colloquial russian word for `` devastation '' , often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 civil war ) -- the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it . now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound , there are well-translated english subtitles too , though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation . i do n't know is that dvd available abroad but if you 'll find it grab it immediately , it 's really worthy of watching . and , in conclusion , a fact : about the 50 % of russians today , mostly youth , can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree . it 's the post-soviet effect : soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization , tv-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive , soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian . even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it 's amazingly common in colloquial speech .
polanski returns to the themes of solitude and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in repulsion and rosemary 's baby , in the tenant . the atmosphere is trademark polanski - dark , brooding , unnerving - but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate . sven nykvist , who was responsible for some of bergman 's most beautiful films , does n't quite do himself justice here . as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie , i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film . the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting . polanski is certainly not a bad actor , but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of trelkovsky . some of the supporting cast are great , notably melvyn douglas as the landlord and shelley winters as the concierge , but others are weak and miscast . it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed parisians have american accents . quite unexpectedly , there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film . anyone who has seen the fearless vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor . however , there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself . trelkovsky 's sudden ( and somewhat unexplained ) 'transformation ' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows , which detracts from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho-dramatic journey . all in all , the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience , if a little too languorous for its own good . there 's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film , while being very good , does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have . alas , at the end of the day , an 'okay ' polanski movie is still better than most other 'good ' movies . definitely worth a watch , just do n't expect to be blown away .
sidney franklin 's `` the good earth '' has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting , especially from luis ranier , who won an oscar for her portrayal of o-lan . rainers performance is so complete , she is nearly unrecognizable . having very little dialogue throughout the entire film ( and it is a long one ) , rainer relies instead on facial and body language . she looks and acts chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as such . the film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it . when lung and wife o-lan finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty , they find a life full of possessions but lacking in meaning . it is only when they return to the earth after fighting off a swarm of locusts ( the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch ) that they again find fulfillment . a common formula told with the unique perspective of a chinese family ( especially for 1937 ) makes the film a classic . money is n't worth anything without friends and family , a point that the film drives home perfectly in it 's last 10 minutes with an emotionally fulfilling conclusion .
despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced . presented in digestible ( as digestible as war can be ) episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time . eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the u.s . the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year .
simply put , this is the best movie to come out of michigan since ... well , ever ! evil dead eat your heart out , hatred of a minute was some of the oddest , and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time . i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip , or a good case of the willies !
i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started . it was a must see for the whole family , i believe on sun . nights . repeating gags were rob opening his locker ( he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things , finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open ) , and taking pins out of a new shirt ( at the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt , timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs . ) i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted `` sonny '' to say something scientific . he would think and come up with `` semi permeable membrane '' or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was . ( you had to have been there ) . marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen . why they did n't continue the series from her pov when wally quit ( he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too late ) i 'll never know . i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding ( big one anyway ) was tiny tim on the carson show . horsecocky . it was rob and nancy ( did i ever have the hots for her ) and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines . a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now . i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older .
really touching story of a recruitment camp in america , where young men are prepared for the vietnam war . the human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies , because it translates personal , subjective opinions on war , opposed war action movies where action , and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor . the movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject , and manages to distance itself from usual war movies , especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard . the movie focuses on the tragic character of bozz , who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine , and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he does n't believe in , spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas , both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war . perfect irony . the acting is truly exceptional , and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie . also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts , hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted .
this one and `` her pilgrim soul '' are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone . as i mentioned in my comment on the new series , there 's something lacking in this new series . maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned . it 's a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than serling 's version . however , this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too . i think the appeal is that no matter what they do , the lovers can never unite . i remember i was n't surprised by the korean movie `` il mare '' ( later remade into `` the lake house '' . i think it 's because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film .
dennis hopper and jt walsh steal the show here . cage and boyle are fine , but what gives this neo-noir its juice is hopper 's creepy , violent character and jt walsh 's sneakiness . a drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man , and tries to make a little dough out of it , but gets in over his head . i found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie , when cage walks into a trailer in wyoming to get drilling work , with the help of his buddy ... and the opening scene in brokeback mountain , when the character does the same thing ! but that 's another story . dennis hopper is at his best here ... cocky , one-step-ahead villainous , seething and explosively violent . jt walsh ( rip ) is also great as the man with a dark past , trying to live legitimately ( well , almost ) . there are only 4 real characters of note here , with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of red rock , wyoming . the first twist hits early on , and from there it 's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town . satisfying . 8 pts .
this is my first comment on imdb website , and the reason i 'm writing it is that we 're talking about one of the best films ever ! 'ne goryuy ! ' will make you laugh and cry at the same time , you will fall in love ( if you 're not a fan yet ! ) with georgian choir singing tradition , and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it : ) what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character . the film is starring vahtang kikabidze ( who is great ) , but you will remember every single face around him in the film . you will find yourself quoting their lines , that have become household names for so many russian-speaking people . a film to live with . simple , yet deep , you will want to watch it again and again .
good action and interesting plot . having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie . good cast .. meaningful acting .. although it would nice to see some more expansion in the action scenes rather than the background story . fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7/10 is a right vote i think !
i have to admit that for the first half hour or so of this movie i was basically lost . there had been some mildly amusing humour , but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time . then - for no apparent reason - i suddenly realized that i was enjoying this . there was no blinding moment of realization and no suddenly dramatic scene that grabbed me . in fact nothing very exciting happens in the entire movie . it was as if i just all of a sudden realized that the movie was meant to be largely pointless - and that in its very pointlessness was its charm . morgan freeman starred as an unnamed actor who finds a “ little project ” to jumpstart his career . he 's going to play a supermarket manager , and spends the day in a neighbourhood supermarket to research the role . while there he meets and bonds with scarlet ( played by paz vega ) - a cashier who wants more out of life . he helps her prepare for a job interview as if she 's auditioning for a role , while she introduces him to real life . it 's truly funny watching “ him ” ( for that 's how the character is identified in the credits ) be overwhelmed by a visit to the local target store . freeman and vega were great together , with a strange but completely believable sort of combined romantic but father-daughter chemistry . if you feel lost at the beginning , stick with this . in the end , it turns out to be a delightfully charming movie . 7/10
i 'm 14 , so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that . boy are you wrong . i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it . i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten . i saw the movie oh , god recently and loved it . this one was also very awesome . george burns did a great job . so did walter matthau ( this is the first time i 've ever seen him perform ) . and even though they had really small roles , phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job . that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done . let me say this , if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau , you should see this movie right away !
this is a documentary i came across by chance on the uk tv channel more4 and i have to say i found it extremely interesting and thought provoking . i will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary . basically this is professor jared diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth 's societies prospered and others did not . the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one . as for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary . diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses . people have claimed his theory is marxist but i do not buy this and see it more socio geologist . it was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion . highly recommended viewing .
despite the title , the sword bearer , and the dvd cover ( action/herioc poses of the sword bearer ) this is not a super hero film . ( minor spoilers ) it follows the tale of sasha , the sword bearer , who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm . cool you say , but no , this is real life . if you had this power as a child could you control it when , say , faced by a mad man , or when your mum 's boyfriend is beating her . and if you do n't control it , how do you cope with being a two time killer at the age of 12 . this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him . wandering aimlessly after another killing ( much like a bout de soufflé ) . he then meet katya , and the pair fall instantly in love , providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways . however , his past is still chasing him , in the form of two police officers . that is essentially the story , and there is virtually no action on screen , though a lot if suggested . i really like this movie . unlike many hollywood 'super hero ' films , we get very little back story , there is no bad guy ( unless you count the sword bearer himself ) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development . worth checking out if you can find it .
a really great movie and true story . dan jansen the greatest skater ever . a touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy . the story of jane jansens battle with cancer and dan jansen love for his sister . of a important promise made by jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister jane was right to believe in his talent in speed skating was justified . this picture is well worth the time . i wish they would make more films of this quality . thank you for a great film with excellent actors and an excellent story . it is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister .
fassbinder 's most lavish production sacrifices little of his talent for identifying and deconstructing a locus of suffering in long , mobile takes that somehow also act as social encapsulations ; here , it 's much more overt , since the story takes place in war-torn germany at the end of wwii , and the central character is a woman ( hanna schygulla as maria ) who capitalizes on vulnerabilities ( both economic and gender-related ) to catapult herself up the ladder of a prominent textile corp. that makes coveted goods like lederhosen available to indigent workers ( as she once was ) . married amidst allied air raids , maria and her new husband herrmann are allowed a brief honeymoon before he 's shipped out to the russian front . in his absence , her despair is great : she spends most days at the train station , waiting for him to return . when he is reported dead , she abruptly stops grieving and takes a job as a barmaid/prostitute at a brothel catering to american gi 's . when he returns , things get plenty messy , as circumstances ( and his sense of noble self-sacrifice ) conspire to keep them apart . the message is fassbinder 's m.o . writ large : 'love is colder than death , ' but not only is maria contending with her own sanity and a husband largely incapable of loving her , but a country in deep flux with no discernible light at the end of the tunnel . fassbinder is making some kind of statement on post-war germany selling out to the highest bidder , but as with all his films , i tend to block those elements out and focus on the unbearable passions on display : fassbinder 's as evoked through his characters ; his actors ' as filtered through their real-life connections with fassbinder . taken together , his films can be either unbearable or indescribably mesmeric , often at once ; this falls somewhere in-between , although definitely closer to the latter . while i did n't like it quite as much as the bitter tears of petra von kant or katzelmacher , maria braun certainly has a greater scope and what 's more , i could feel its passion and authentic detail to human emotions .
wow ! the sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances . absolutely incredible ! if this was visconti 's debut film , i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film . the only other one of his i 've seen ( at time of writing ) is death in venice - which was absolutely incredible : more dazzling visually than ossessione ( obsession ) . one of the most beautiful films i 've ever seen , but its story was not as involving as ossessione . if you click on `` miscellaneous '' on this page 's links , there are stills from the movie on those websites . they wo n't really do justice to the experience of the movie : such graceful camera movements , such beautiful composition , such wonderful faces , such terrific characters , such a great story development , the first movie adapted from james m cain 's `` the postman always rings twice . '' i ca n't believe this was made in 43 , eight years before brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with streetcar named desire ( 1951 ) . the actors in this may not have used the method technique , ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves ( i do n't know anything about it ) - but they 're some of the best , most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema . also , eight years before streetcar named desire brought a new sensuality to the screen , ossessione was electrifyingly sensual ! the most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema ! yes , i 'm being superlative , but ossessione was just that terrific . the reason ossessione did n't cause the impact streetcar did was that it was made in fascist italy and banned by mussolini , and re-cut in america . american audiences did n't see its full glory till 59 , eight years after streetcar . i wo n't say any more about it - just writing to tell you its one of the best , most beautiful and exciting movies i 've ever seen , and tell you to go out and see it ! like another reviewer , i 'm going to buy it as soon as i can find it !
i 'll come clean . the only reason i even found out about this dvd was because dominic monaghan is a favorite actor of mine . when i heard the title of the film , i thought it was going to be ... different , perhaps in not such a good way . but i was wrong . after reading what few reviews were out there about this short , i was actually excited about seeing it . i sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later . needless to say , i was not disappointed . the film follows jack , a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality , and what is all in his head . i wo n't give away what happens , but i will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it 's realism . the directing is fantastic , focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments . all in all , i give this great film 9 out of 10 , for going far beyond what i thought any short could achieve .
after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century , in 1908 playwright d.w. griffith got the job that would make him a legend : he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies . it was n't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business , but he accepted the job , and in less than a year he became biograph 's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative . many years later , he would direct `` the birth of a nation '' in 1915 , the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema 's first recognized authors ; however , a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career . 1909 's `` the sealed room '' is one of those , and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century . `` the sealed room '' is a story set in the 16th century in which a count ( arhtur v. johnson ) has built a windowless room in his castle . it is a small yet nice and very cozy room , as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife , the countess ( marion leonard ) in a more private way . however , the count does n't know that his wife is not exactly faithful , as she is infatuated with the minstrel ( henry b. walthall ) at court , with whom she is having an affair . as soon as the count gets busy with his own business , the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count 's new room . when the count returns , he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect , finally discovering the two lovers in his room ; but instead of making a scene , he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife : to seal the windowless room with the couple inside . written by griffiths ' regular collaborator frank e. woods , `` the sealed room '' takes elements from edgar allan poe 's `` the cask of amontillado '' and mainly honoré de balzac 's `` la grande breteche '' to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism . despite having a runtime of 11 minutes , woods ' screenplay develops the story in a very good way , and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story . while a melodrama at heart , woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era . `` the sealed room '' is definitely a very simple and basic story , but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith 's melodramas . in `` the sealed room '' , griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual . while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience , in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror , playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had . it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot , culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes . not being a movie where camera tricks are essential , what shines the most in `` the sealed room '' is griffith 's talent to direct his actors , as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day . as usual , the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith , starting with arthur v. johnson as the count . johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character 's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster . his performance is not without a touch of overacting , but actually that adds realism to the character 's exaggerated personality . as the countess , marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting , conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery . finally , the legendary henry b. walthall appears as the handsome minstrel , and while far from being one of his best performances , he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film . while not of real importance to the plot , it 's nice to see other members of griffith 's stock company in the background , like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court . while not exactly a masterpiece , `` the sealed room '' is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days . the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget , griffith 's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style . the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era , and johnson 's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch . while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential ( and controversial ) `` the birth of a nation '' , the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend . simple yet elegant , `` the sealed room '' is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century . 7/10
i ca n't believe we do n't have that 70 's show anymore . i have all 8 seasons of that 70 's show ! ! i absolutely love it ! ! i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep . at the end of a long busy day it 's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep . i was so sad they took the show off air ... at least we still have the re-runs ! ! i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion ... like maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married ! ! ! ! would n't that be awesome ! ! ! it would be even better if they would continue it for several years ! !
bill paxton , of aliens , near dark , and terminator fame , surprises me with his debut as director for frailty . he hits on all cylinders , but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the fbi agent ( powers booth ) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller . other than that , this movie was just fine . bill paxton plays dad . he 's never given a first name , but that is not a weakness of the film . it in fact strengthens the film , allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind . he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons fenton meiks ( matt oleary ) and adam meiks ( jeremy sumpter ) must fine the demons and kill them . the demons look like normal people which they kill , and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind , or is he really doing god 's work . there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense . the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up ( matthew mcconaughey ) and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle ( powers booth ) who is very skeptical and rightfully so . after all it 's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is . the film has many twists , and bill paxton directs splendidly by keeping us guessing without losing interest . the acting is incredible . the two young leads and paxton work great together , looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder . like i said there is the one implausibility involving powers booth 's character , but it really is n't a big thing . this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family .
it 's awesome ! in story mode , your going from punk to pro . you have to complete goals that involve skating , driving , and walking . you create your own skater and give it a name , and you can make it look stupid or realistic . you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the skateboard team ( you can pick a team to be on ) and you then start your own team ! there are many levels like new jersey , manhattan , and even school ii ( not part of story mode though ) from tony hawk 's pro skater 2 . you can unlock secret skaters like iron man , gene simmons , and another skater . you can create your own goals like skate letters , combo letters , tricktris , gap , and much more . you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak . if you get bored of doing that , you can do the premade goals in premade parks . the only thing i did n't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars . 9/10 .
there is great detail in a bug 's life . everything is covered . the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping . the film is n't too terribly orignal , it 's basically a modern take on kurosawa 's seven samurai , only with bugs . i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad . it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs . the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper , the lead bad guy , was a brillant creation . check this one out .
freddy 's dead : the final nightmare ( 1991 ) was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act ( not as an entity or a co-star ) . the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood . it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town . the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price . only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere . but that does n't stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge . no matter how they try to stop him , he always comes back for more . but this time he finds out a little more about his old life . can the kids finally stop freddy for good ? what is this secret that is buried in freddy 's twisted mind ? to find out you 'll have to watch freddy 's dead . the end was originally filmed in 3-d. a fitting way to end the franchise . freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang ! lisa zane , yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment . rosanne , tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances . a whole lot better than the last one but it 's filled with a few dated jokes . if you enjoy the series then you do n't want to miss out on this one . i have to recommend this movie for freddy fans .
i loved this film . not being a swooning ed wood jr. fan , i prefer to appreciate his `` boundless enthusiasm '' and acknowledge his shortcomings . his movies are fun , but his personal story is one racked with pain . i hoped , and was delighted to find , that this film would be about understanding his turbulent life , rather than simply heaping him with posthumous praise . from beginning to end , this film evolves from a documentary into a mythology , leaving the cast and the viewer unexpectedly connected to each other and to ed wood jr. what we get are people who knew ed wood the best talking about him from all perspectives , positive and negative , and showing us their character as much as ed 's . we get insight into ed 's personal and professional life : from his romances , to his drinking , to his sexuality , to his friends , to his enemies , and even to his film making . the film itself is shot in a low-budget way that seems done out of respect for ed , as if using the techniques of most theatrically released movies from 1996 would be disrespectful ( sort of like wearing a nicer suit than the president ) . the set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background . fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding ed wood controversies , and new comers will be amazed that this man was real . the dvd is full of impossible to find gems ( `` crossroads of lorado '' and photo galleries ) , but the real treasure of this film is the surprisingly engaging and interconnected story . ed wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him ( for better or worse ) , to the point where one woman will go down in history as `` swimming pool owner '' for once letting him and his friends be baptized in her pool . this ability to define a person 's legacy comes through universally , as the most amazing effect of the film is to not only give a well rounded idea of the man that was ed wood jr. , but also to give a comprehensive view of the community that he created . somehow , without ever having more that one cast member being interviewed on screen at a time , the connection that ed wood created amongst the various people in his life becomes clear , and the viewer is left with great sense of involvement . even the title hints at the b-list horror genre , but by the end , we see that even this is a kindness . what begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all of the cast will be forever weaved into an unpredictably cohesive fabric that history will bring into haunting unity with wood 's legend . in many ways a living contradiction , ed wood jr. could not be condensed to a single viewpoint . this collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get . being itself a juxtaposition of themes , it is at once respectful , provocative , thoughtful , gripping , fun , sad , kind , and fulfilling .
if you find yourself in need of an escape , something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world , domino will satisfy that need . this is entertainment , after all ! the plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies ( like usual suspects ) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out . i wondered about domino harvey herself , how her life became of interest to hollywood . as for the acting , lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers . and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well . not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume . and granted , mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often , but here , despite the violence , he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people .
the photography of this bid-budget production is surprisingly bad . colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it . direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tv-movie like , too . * and * at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence . hans zimmer 's score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated , untalented composer . but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story , a sort of european version of edna ferber 's family epos giant . while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man , even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by . clara delivers the movie 's spiritual lesson , a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country . her daughter , whose lover is a young antonio banderas at the beginning of his international career , understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it . the way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great . the actors all do a great job , too . i was wondering `` who is the actress playing blanca ? '' all the time , but of course , it was a really young winona ryder ! all in all , this movie really made me want to read the book .
i saw this movie , and the play , and i have to add that this was the most touching story that i had ever seen . until i saw this movie i was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the south african children and adults that were and are living in that era . it brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive , and to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing . this simply surpass a five star , i rate it a ten . thank you mr. mbongeni ngema for such a astonishing story . although it has been 12 years since this story has been told , it is still one that lays heavy in my heart.if there is a vhs , or dvd out there on the play , please notify me asap.thank you . ps there was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance .
i like ghost stories . good ghost stories of bumps in the night , voices that can not be explained . now i 've see many of them . as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films , some times to find a real gem , you got ta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories . now this one , very rare , pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called `` the new house `` was one of the most scariest films i ever saw . it was on once in 1972 , ... i was only 9 , .. but nothing since then even compared to it . with all the remake going on in hollywood , some one should do this one `` as is `` with no more special efx than the original . this episode was down right creepy as hell . i 'm lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find . the only other 2 ghost stories to even come close was the original `` the haunting `` and george c. scott in `` the changling `` . wish someone would do more ghost stories like these .
new york police detective mark dixon ( dana andrews ) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life . the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals , leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law . he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used . dixon can not reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals . he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father 's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence . when a rich texan is murdered following an evening 's gambling run by gangster tommy scalise ( gary merrill ) , dixon is assigned to the case . scalise tells dixon 's superior officer detective lieutenant thomas ( karl malden ) that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine ( craig stevens ) and his wife morgan ( gene tierney ) and that paine had committed the murder . dixon goes to paine 's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him , dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies . dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river . paine 's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalise 's place , adds that her father had gone to paine 's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she 'd returned home with facial bruising . paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father , jiggs taylor ( tom tully ) , had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up . this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder . nobody accepts dixon 's explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness . dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine 's death and the cover up . he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixon 's murder . the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption , provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller . dana andrews ' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character 's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paine 's accidental death . dixon , however , is n't the only one to experience misfortune as morgan , a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her . her father , who 'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police , unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit . ken paine who 'd been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise who 'd been set up in business by dixon 's father also suffers his own misfortunes . `` where the sidewalk ends '' is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity .
it 's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes . and none more so that september 11 , 2001 , a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism . no , this documentary did n't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11 . rather , the filmmakers , brothers gédéon and jules naudet , set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie new york firefighter . they had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training , and had handpicked their `` proby '' ( probation firefighter ) to join them in an ny firehouse , home to ladder 1 and engine 7 . but their production was to develop and contain at that time , believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the world trace center . i was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of lan gaming , and received a call at about 850pm local time from my dad , who informed me of the above . few minutes later , he told me there was another , and that the wtc was under attack . by the time i arrived home , the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke , and to my horror , they collapsed , under an hour . the filmmakers had two cameras running that day , one who had followed a team out on a routine call , and which immediately raced to the wtc upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . we follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of wtc1 where the first responders of firefighters , paramedics , and police had to make sense of what happened , and to quickly develop a plan of action . the other camera , held by the other brother , was making his way to wtc to look for his sibling , and along the journey , captured the many expressions of new yorkers , as well as the sense of chaos in and around manhatten . peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from ladder 1 and engine 7 , which miraculously , did not suffer any casualty . but being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil , as they struggle to come to terms with the event . through the events that unfold , we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs , to save lives . we began with what the documentary was supposed to be , before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus , right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures . it 's not a film that is fabricated , and what you see here can not be recreated in any other documentary ( and heavens , not sound stages for hollywood blockbusters ) . it 's as close as you can get to that day , witnessing the event up close , from safety . code 1 dvd contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of ladder 1 and engine 7 .

089 : footlight parade ( 1933 ) - released 9/30/1933 , viewed 5/5/07 . the ice cream cone is invented in new york . kevin : after a long and busy break , we hit another busby berkeley musical from warner bros . this time it 's the ultra-fast paced footlight parade , starring james cagney as juggernaut stage producer chester kent . i am 100 % certain that cagney was channeling berkeley with his performance of the irrepressible kent , who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute . joan blondell is also excellent as the acid-tongued secretary-turned-love interest . the ruby keeler/dick powell subplot is not as major this time but no less enjoyable . one thing that baffled me was berkeley 's performances themselves , which seemed far too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage , let alone a stage that would be showing a film afterwards . obviously busby does n't let a little thing like story impede him from putting together the most over-the-top musical numbers he can possibly conjure . i liked nearly all of this movie until the end , with the shamelessly offensive number `` shanghai lil , '' which , as one can guess , is about as stomach-turning as racially distasteful performances come . doug : six movies in three months . got to be a new record . anyway this completes warner bros. ' musical trilogy of 1933 , preceded by '42nd street ' and 'gold diggers of 1933 . ' i would definitely recommend watching all three in a row . i wonder if james cagney was channeling busby berkeley while he was playing chester kent in this movie , or if that the role as written was inspired by busby . i hope it was ; it seems to make sense that berkeley is the kind of guy who would see elaborate dances in everyday occurrences the way chester does . the funny thing about cagney was that he did n't really look like a leading man in the traditional sense . he was 5 ' 7 '' , square-headed , and talked with an odd new york accent . but the guy was quite versatile , going from the venomous gangsters that made him so famous to the fast-talking producer-types we see here . and he could dance . basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor . the rest of the cast has some familiar faces ; joan blondell returns and just about steals the show as cagney 's loyal and lusting secretary ; dick powell and ruby keeler play the cute couple , but seem to get less screen time than before ; billy barty pops up again as the mischievous imp . the movie is typical of the more racy and adult-oriented musicals of the pre-code era , as opposed to those of the 50 's and 60 's that were more family oriented , and is an excellent climax of the warner musicals of that year ( the `` shanghai lil '' number not withstanding , with keeler doing a poor job at looking chinese ) . last film : dinner at eight ( 1933 ) . next film : i 'm no angel ( 1933 ) .
this is an excellent film , with an extraordinary cast and acting . i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this did n't get the oscar for best film and for best actress ( woopi goldberg ) ... it certainly deserved it . in any case , take a look at it . i am sure you will enjoy it very much .
it is said that david lynch 's films and shorts wo n't appeal to everyone . neither will dumbland , maybe more than ever . i have a feeling that dumbland , as people come across it , will be a true mark of ' i get it ' or 'what the hell ' . it 's not surrealism exactly , but absurd to the point of no return . it 's also very , very , very stupid . but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it , that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is , and this self-consciousness is a plus , not a detraction . it 's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts- the kind that might not even make it on hertzfeldt and judge 's animation show ( which , i might add , lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work- centered on a lummox with an iq of 20 who has a constantly quivering-with-fear wife , and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and/or an alien . the episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill , a salesman who can recite the gettysburg address , watching over a sick brother in law , ant hallucinations , and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around . all the while , lynch is still experimenting , as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off inland empire . for one thing , he 's going back to the roots of his very first short , six figures getting sick six times , in the usage of repetition as a means to an end . this sometimes works excruciatingly well , and sometimes not . sometimes , like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around , the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect . and even an episode like with the guy 's friend coming over is funny more-so for the beavis & butt-head comparison ( both laugh like idiots , and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep ) . what ends up working is how lynch shows up front delirious abstractions , in the crudest ways imaginable , and excessive violence . in what comes closest to surrealism in `` ants '' , the guy mistakenly sprays bug-spray ( just called `` kill '' , one of lynch 's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions ) on himself , and envisions ants in a musical chorus line , solos included . and one of the most harrowingly funny things i 've ever seen from the filmmaker is `` get the stick '' , where we just see the guy , cheered on by his son , getting a stick lodged in his mouth . soon the neck breaks , eyes pop out , and once said stick is removed he does n't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover . other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices , and it 's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul-mouthed language ( mostly from the man , as well as from the 'grandmother ' , who in one of lynch 's voices for the characters is the deepest of all ) , and a shaky quality that 's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from ( early ) hertzfeldt . all the same i 'm still not sure if dumbland is something i would put into someone 's hands if they have n't seen much of lynch yet let alone anything by him . there are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in lynch 's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life . however in general there 's not a whole lot that should be read into it , which is why i 'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion . those who dig the bottom-less pits of animated comedy , be prepared have a blast .
the first word which comes into my mind after watching this movie is `` beauty '' . beauty is all around , in actors ' play ( andie is superb as always ) , in well designed shots , and in authors ' red line idea - the love . i think the kenny 's character is the only white spot in these three womens ' otherwise boring and predictable life . his interaction makes andie 's character living as entertaining as it could possibly be . when he 's gone , it became obvious that we can not really appreciate and hold to our inner believes and sacred desires . the fact that andie successfully recovers from this loss is nothing bad , instead it shows that life prevails in any forms , even in this small british village , which is shown perfectly . another reason i love this movie is that it is so british in all ways - all that houses and `` fags '' and accents : ) ) ) . and andie again is doing superb job ! it is a shame that this movie got such low marks . 10 out of ten !
i am one of jehovah 's witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility . over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions , have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens , and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood . i have also heard several jehovah 's witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field i have never actually seen it happen , leaving the question , `` is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue ? '' the issue for jehovah 's witnesses is a moral one . `` you must abstain from blood '' is not an ambiguous statement . thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it .
my first child was born the year this program came out , and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter . when the cd came out , i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start families ... it invariably becomes their favorite christmas album . i recently found several dvd 's ( made on dvd-r from video tapes , probably ) for sale on ebay . the one i bought was an excellent copy , and it was so great to see the show again after more than 25 years . there are some songs on the show that were not on the album , and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show . but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever .
this a casper the friendly ghost short from my childhood , and i re-watch it on youtube ( thank god ! for you tube ) ; after that i love this short , and it is one of my favorite casper shorts . i love how the short starts off spooky with frank gallop 's haunting narration ; until we get to see casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery , reading . while every ghost rose from the graves to `` boo '' people , casper decides to leave in search for a friend . but in trying to make a friend , anyone who sees casper runs away . poor casper sat on a log and weep ; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him . casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend . casper and ferdie 's relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when casper is not keeping a close eye on ferdie while they are playing a game of hide and seek . while ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little ferdie and ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting . while the hunter is firing gunshots towards ferdie casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter 's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves ferdie alone . and the hunter and dogs are terrified of casper . casper yells to ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine . but casper sees ferdie 's body is not moving and asks if he is ok . when casper sees ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost `` the only friend he ever had in his whole life . '' casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to casper 's gravestone . casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself . ferdie starts licking casper on his cheek . casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with ferdie . overall , it is a really good short ; though surprisingly disturbing , showing death in a family-oriented cartoon .
i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd ( fully restored editions ) & i never tire of watching them . my personal favorite is `` tarzan and his mate '' , due entirely ( well almost entirely ) to maureen o'sullivan 's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front . before anyone claims that a - it was n't really her , or b - it was n't really what it looks like , let me say that i have watched it numerous time , in high zoom mode , and trust me ... it is her , and she is completely naked underneath that costume ... several times , especially during the lion attack at the end , careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia ... there is no mistake about that at all . as to the swimming scene being a body double in a `` skin '' suit , yes , it is a double , but she is not wearing any `` skin '' suit or anything else ... again , slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it . now , that controversy out of the way , let 's move on the actual movie ... i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly ... the action sequences were simply great , although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino , weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion ... the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio & us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which . do n't complain too much though , remember that 90 % of all films is phony anyway , so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn , some cold beer , and a fresh pack of smokes ... a sexy and willing girlfriend/wife is n't out of line either ... lol . oh ... one final word about nudity ... at the very beginning , while the white hunters are speaking dialogue , keep your eyes on the background extras ... there are several good shots of nude african girls ( obviously shot on location ) behind them . one more thing , the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930 's until the 1960 's ... that 's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then . shaft had n't even been thought about at that time , nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history . safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads ... and tiny 's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane . as a matter of fact , it was n't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so .
eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series . i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show . i have always preferred kerry to bridget , bridget has been done before , kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways , although i 'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series . early episodes were fun , good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids , however i think the show lost it 's sparkle when john ritter died . i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died , i felt the programme did to . to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the ' 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter ' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad . bridget seemed to get more annoying , rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring life 's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul . i think the granddad is funny ( especially when he 's watching great escape ) but feel c.j is unnecessary to the show . he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series . over all the newer ones are n't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and c.j and granddad 's always there too ? i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry , but later ones were about average at best .
the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the archers ' logo , the introductory disclaimer , the way the camera pans over the cosmos . it 's strange to think that ` it 's a wonderful life ' came out in the same year . no great coincidence : the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films ; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered , something best passed over in silence , when placed next to alfred junge 's vision . it continues to look great all the way through , as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us . i 'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general . one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other . not so here . powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it 's the most natural thing in the world , a mere change of palettes . both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own . as for the story ... this may be pressburger 's best script , or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events . other than that it 's tight , yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here . was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary ? ( or both ? perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was , as it so happened , true . ) everyone says we 're meant to neither ask nor answer this question , but i do n't see why . i 'm sure we are meant to ask the question . the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed , the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions . the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well does n't mean that this should n't occupy us as well . there is , as i 've said before , a lot going on . consider the scene in which abraham farlan ( heaven 's prosecuting lawyer ) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match , and contemptuously says , ` the voice of england , 1945 . ' dr. reeves ( the defence ) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment , and then produces one of his own : a blues song from america , which farlan listens to as though he 's got a lemon in his mouth . reeves looks smug . snobbery ? well , i do n't see why it 's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that 's not what powell and pressburger are doing , anyway . as the song is being played , we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it : several of them nod their heads to the rhythm , perfectly at home . they do n't find it incomprehensible . there 's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is . reeves probably realises as much . all english audiences ( and all australian , indian , etc . audiences as well ) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast , too ; and that while reeves understands that , he is unable to explain it to farlan - hence the blues broadcast , which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else . it 's a clever scene . one last thing . i found david niven a bit cold , without the charisma he would acquire later in his career ; but even so , i do n't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began , as this one did .
no other movie has made me feel like this before ... and i do n't feel bad . like , i do n't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie ( 9 months ) nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this ______ . the reason i say `` _____ '' is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just ca n't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up . i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather . no movie has ever done this to me before . never in my life have i wanted cauliflower , milk , and baguettes this much . thank you . - ed uh . * clears throat * no words . no thoughts . i do n't know . i truly do n't know . - cait
rosenstrasse is more an intimate film than one of epic proportions , which could have kept away many film goers looking for a pianist similar plot . fortunately , von trotta , a good screenwriter , opts for a feminist peep to an era too much illustrated on its colorful exterior , but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary aryan german rather from a jewish standpoint . rosentrasse finds its strength in these unsung burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances of which they emerge as victims . the pace of the film is introspective , poignantly slow , meditative . besides , the characters are so vivid while transitions between generations and the passing of time has been deftly crafted . rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece , and some narrative flaws are well discerned . another fault lies on a trivial cinematography unable to capture the intensity of the internal drama lived by the characters . nevertheless , this film is worth seeing . finally , rosenstrasse is part of the last trend in german films dealing with the ghosts of a nightmarish past , trend that includes such excellent films as nowhere in africa , and recently , the controversial downfall . i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images .
expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges , flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated . it actually has a feminist storyline , though i do n't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set . it certainly was n't practiced . women ( and the jews and the poor ) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society . throughout the story , sister flavia ( florinda bolkan ) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just ca n't sit there any longer and actually does something about it , albeit with disastrous results . the pre-credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield . she sees an injured `` evil '' muslim soldier ( one of the few still alive ) and tries to assist him . before she can , her hate-filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face ( great family dynamics , huh ? ) . after this , her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice . though scenes do involve violence , rape and nuns , i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation . indeed , many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there , but the acting , camera-work , storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level . most `` nun '' films i 've seen usually have the basic premise of : a good girl somehow winds up in a convent , where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell . flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her . much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong-spirited ( but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me , but it 's a lot easier for guys ) sister agatha . when a group of muslims attack their abbey , flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns . their attackers actually function as their liberators ( of the cruelty and near-slavery of the abbey ) . in fact , it is a christian , not a muslim invader , that impales dear sister agatha . it is agatha 's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... her father treats her like dirt . her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time . i do n't want to give out too much of the rest of the story , but be prepared to be shocked , devastated and saddened at the conclusion . this is a great film , so do n't be put off by its ( undeserved ) reputation as a trash epic . plus , how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong ? i am not familiar with maría casares ' other works , but sister agatha is a hell of a character . i have read many great reviews of the synapse ( us ) release , but i love my german x-rated kult dvd copy . it is n't anamorphic/16:9 , but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse 's release . and there are also many great , wise or funny lines of dialogue ( many from sister agatha ) `` why is god male ? the father , the son , and the holy spirit they 're all male ! '' -flavia `` these men are afraid- look at them , sister- afraid their power will be taken away from them ! '' -sr. agatha ( regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive ) `` woman , where are you going ? the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians have n't done ! ha ha ha ! '' -sr. agatha ( to a group of fleeing christian women ) `` lord bless these moslems- for putting fear into these pompous christians . '' -flavia `` does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you $ h ! t your underclothing ? '' -sr. agatha closing message : `` flavia gaetani , not yet a muslim - no longer a christian - was punished as a runaway nun . the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto ''
once in a while , you come upon a movie that defines your values and shows you the true depth of human emotions leaving you drained . vivah is just that  maybe more . after watching ddlj , saajan , and lamhey , i really thought that bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - ever . boy was i wrong ! i went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new `` don '' ( just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh  although the decision is already made in my mind ) . after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie i decided to watch it realizing i had nothing else to do . when i saw the rating of u instead of an a , i was happy that at least it is something where i do n't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a hollywood b actress . for the first 5 minutes or so i thought i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting . after all everyone who has seen shahid kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor . boy  was i wrong about this movie . this movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go . it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society . i liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept ( of arranged marriage ) , but also that he did it with a conviction ( that it is the right thing to do ) . i have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good . i felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever , it was still very very good . the good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the i watched that movie a second time . the other good thing is that thee songs are not pushed into the script as we have all seen in so many movies . these songs actually tell a big part of the story and are certainly a welcome addition . just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor ( after company ) , and salman found his groove after `` hum aapkey hain kaun '' ; this movie will help shahid kappor jump to being of the better actors and entertainers in bollywood . this is the first movie of his in which i like him and his role . he acted well and adjusted to being the nice good looking young rich kid . yes you will not find him playing basketball and scoring every point on a dunk like you saw shahrukh in ddlj ( even though he is shown to be an indian in england  both countries not big on basketball by the way ) , he does come across as very believable as a person who holds true to his values . amrita rao , for the first time came across as someone to be remembered . in all her other movies she was competing with big faces which was actually hindering her . no one knew how good of an actress she really is until they watch this movie . some of the scenes in which she has to cry especially towards the end really shows her knowledge and depth of acting . although she has been in another movies she is most memorable in this one . i think this movie will and should do wonders for her . move over rani  there is finally another girl who if given a decent chance to work with good directors can grab the torch from you . she is beautiful with a great voice and has a face that exudes complete innocence . oh having almost 0 % body fat does not hurt either ( yes people i will challenge you find even 0.1 % fat on her and unlike so many others like sonali she can actually act too ) . i thought i will never be enamored by anyone 's beauty after madhuri and early kajol , but she completely changed that . shahid and amrita worked very well together and their relationship fitted their characters and they both did an excellent job ( although i was waiting for shahid to turn into a girl like salman did every time he uttered `` hum aapkey hain kaun '' ) . when i finished watching this movie , it left me so emotionally drained that i decided to watch this movie again ( right away ) . yes right away . i have never ever done that . not even with ddlj , but this movie just had something that had to be understood again and again . i will probably watch this movie a third time over the weekend just so i can watch and relive the traditions we all grew up with . i miss those times where families sat down and had fun . when parents had time for their kids and where kids respected what their parents believed in . i know a lot of people think that movie does not portray real life but deep down do n't we all want it to happen . the families , thee tradition , the love and respect . this is what this movie will remind all of us of . i can assure you it is an extremely well made movie which you will enjoy . i am sure some young people will not like this movie but if you are over 28 i doubt that you will be one of them .
in his otherwise excellent book , lincoln in american memory , the historian merrill peterson calls young mr.lincoln a `` boring , dreadful , film '' . this amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics . i am working on a doctoral dissertation on abraham lincoln and frederick douglass . as part of my preparation for writing the dissertation , i made a careful analysis of this film , and of tag gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on ford . young mr. lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of ford 's cinematic authorship , 1939.in that greatest of hollywood years , ford directed three superb , still not fully appreciated films : drums along the mohawk , stagecoach , and young mr.lincoln . it might seem odd to say that stagecoach is not fully appreciated , all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest westerns , and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time . however , what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy-a triptych , in fact . ford is creating a sort of mythic history of america on screen . drums along the mohawk is the revolutionary war . young mr.lincoln is pre-civil war america.finally , stagecoach is post civil war america . what the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the american adam and his `` errand into the wilderness '' . what are the psychic and social costs of american manifest destiny , as america strives to build a new human city in the wilderness ? lincoln symbolizes americas journey , as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse ( law ) , with the freedom of the wilderness.young mr.lincoln is not history , ( it is full of historical `` howlers'-as both ford and trotti were well aware ) , but myth . this is lincoln , the symbol of justice and mercy , lincoln , the man of the wilderness , striving to found a civilization within himself , and to become the `` remarkable lawgiver ' of young america . young mr. lincoln is not history-like james agee 's long forgotten teleplay about lincoln , and like sandburgs biography , it is an epic poem ... a very beautiful epic poem .
deathtrap runs like a play within a movie about who did what to whom , as it primarily takes place on one set . the premise is that an accomplished playwright , whose star is falling , receives a magnificent manuscript from a former student and so he plans to off his protege and appropriate his play , to the ( loud ) protests of his wife . or so you think , for the first half of the movie . past the halfway mark , deathtrap begins to throw in twists and surprises that turn its premise on its head , then right around , and then in a mad spin , all the time keeping its title appropriate . it 's an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit . michael caine , as the senior playwright , plays himself in this movie - a slightly loony and very dramatic brit . no surprises here - he does his usual good work . he gets the best line of deathtrap , which he executes perfectly : `` what is your definition of success , being gang-banged in a state penitentiary ? '' christopher reeve , on the other hand , juggles comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious ( and psychopathic ) young playwright . he also gets to show off his very toned body , which he must 've retained coming off the superman movies . caine and reeve have collaborated in another movie that 's one of my favorite comedies - noises off . it similarly revolves around a play as well , although this time caine is the director and reeve is an actor . they are joined by comic veterans carol burnett , john ritter , marilu henner ( taxi ) and mark linn-baker ( perfect strangers ) . together , they demonstrate the calamities that befall the bed-hopping cast and crew of a play . on the surface , the movie looks to be mostly slapstick but upon watching you find that they are many subtle jokes that require more than one viewing to catch . wish this underrated movie was available on dvd .
pop quiz : you 're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history . what do you do ? well , if you 're a hollywood studio , you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i . samurai ( aka timeslip ) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier , have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie . but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown , this sees its premise through : thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars , its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action , including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other . and yes , there are decapitations . of course , things do n't go as planned , and even superior firepower does n't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers . even before that , the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home , those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it . impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through , the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction , especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly ca n't pronounce the words let alone speak the language , but it 's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner . optimum 's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version .
running man is n't a great movie , in fact it 's kinda silly . but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment . i do n't see how anyone could n't enjoy this picture , it 's so silly and over the top , that it almost makes fun of itself . by the way , this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there .
it is not every film 's job to stimulate you superficially . i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day . while this really ca n't be described as a failure , the sum of its parts remains ambiguous . that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again . this is a challenging , provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly . the problem with the movie is in its structure . its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up , just as a second ending is tacked on . though everything is technically dazzling , the movie is exactly too long by that unit . the long-delayed climax of leo 's awakening comes about 20 minutes late . great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script , but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas . the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging ; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground is n't . the world depicted is deliberate , treacherous and absurd . keep your eyes peeled for a memorable , technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw drop . the compositions are stunning . whomever chose to release the ( out of print ) videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it . where is the dvd ? it is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review . you should see it at least once . you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew , but this movie ends up being richer for it . i suspect he is familiar with hitchcock 's foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does . all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies . after zentropa , von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary , over-rated , un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark .
takashi miike is one of my favorite directors and i was worried about him doing a kids film , because i would hate to see him depart from his films i came to love : visitor q , gozu , izo , ichi the killer and black socioty trilogy . lately he seems to be exploring new territory and i think he 's succeeding . still this was the first of his films i 'd seen him take that direction , so i was nervous . of coarse i bought it without seeing it and was glad i did . great yokai war is a perfect kids film and adults should like it too . the whole film reminded me so much of the movies i loved as a child : neverending story , labyrinth , return to oz , etc . i enjoyed those films because they did n't treat kids like they 're stupid and this one does n't either . the dark underlying morals are there , but , it 's also as silly as any kids film should be . i personally was n't bothered by the cgi and prosthetics . i feel like they fit well and do n't think kids will notice . if you are a die hard takashi miike fan , you may not like this one . but , i suggest giving it a shot . it proves that miike is as diverse and talented as i suspected he is . he also continues to make his signature miike films outside of these ones , which is very reassuring . to those people that are new to takashi miike and want something light hearted or dramatic like this one , i suggest these other miike films : 'zebraman ' 'the happiness of the katakuris ' 'sabu ' and 'the bird people in china . ' good job takashi miike ! 8/10 stars .
it is an almost ideal romantic anime ! must see for all ages ! but the english dubbed version is not too good . perhaps the 1999 version will be better .
excellent farce ! which , of course , is all it is intended to be . thankfully there is neither a social or political message , nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction . could the plot actually take , or have taken place in any particular time or location ? unlikely , for , after all , this is simply , merely , a movie , and movies spring from imagination , not from reality . the only goal of this movie is to entertain , certainly not to educate , and entertain it does , with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds . i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity . but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a `` no-brainer , '' which the mating game is in all respects . for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then , this is fine fare fantasy .
1927 , and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade . now that it had become the site of a multi-million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established , some of those in the calmer quarters of this film-making factory were taking the time for a little self-reflection . the last command , while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times , frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality , and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal . it was written by lajos biro , who had been on the scene long enough to know . taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood 's most celebrated immigrants  emil jannings . before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy , being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well-timed performance , often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has-beens . he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter , and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings 's scenery-chomping caricatures . however , as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range , showing by turns delicate frailty , serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale . he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration ( the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety ) , but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance . the director was another immigrant , albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry . nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister ( the `` von '' was made up , by the way ) , and took a very distinctive approach to the craft . of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone , a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes . we open with a carefully-constructed chaos with movement in converging directions , which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen . then , when jannings arrives , everything settles down . jannings 's performance is incredibly sedate and measured , and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order . sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence , allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen , and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic . in fact , he really seems to have an all-round lack of interest in action . in the scene of the prisoners ' revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance , his camera eventually retreating to a fly-on-the-wall position . compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent , which are a complex medley of point-of-view shots and intense close-ups , thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction . as a personality on set , it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell , and in fact powell 's portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on . unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with , and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones , the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired . while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically , it appears no-one told his co-stars they were not in a comedy . evelyn brent is fairly good , giving us some good emoting , but overplaying it here and there . the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself . it 's a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless , like a male ninotchka , but he does a good job , revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard-hearted exterior . the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices , as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film-making process , even a relatively tame example like this . at the very least , i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the `` behind-the-scenes '' view , as it threatened the mystique of movie-making which was still very much alive at this point . as it turned out , such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor , as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and ( according to some sources , although the issue is a little vague ) a nomination for best picture . this is significant , since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self-indulgent back-slapping by the hollywood elite . but elite or not , they recognised good material when they saw it , and were willing to reward it .
`` the incredible melting man '' is a fantastically gross , trashy and energetic z-grade production that every self-respecting camp-horror freak simply has to see for him/herself ! the ideal way to describe this low-budget 70 's gem is like a shameless copy of hammer 's `` the quatermass xperiment '' ... only a thousand times filthier ! astronaust steve west is the only survivor of a disastrous space-mission , but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt ! in shock after seeing his face in the mirror ( can you blame him ? ) , steve busts out of the hospital , leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind . doctor ted nelson has to find him urgently , as the disease also set steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh . the premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effects from the hand of rick baker . the melting dude 's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like darth vader ! another big advantage is that william sachs ' screenplay does n't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches . the repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film . just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because , if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script , you 'll miss out on all the campy fun !
i loved this movie . first , because it is a family movie . second , because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family , with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies . the brothers are very close , yet are not judgmental . their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble , but not needed in the end . i understand that leo 's choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people , but i believed it was the right choice for him . i ca n't believe that this was a french television programme . it had great production values . i gave this movie a ten , and i think you will too , once you have seen it .
buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when `` humanizing '' animals , and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them . based on a true story , buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other , and that they will do anything for each other . while not a perfect movie , the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children . this film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets , but does show the difficulties . a recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions .
billed as the story of steve biko -- played excellently by denzel washington , as you 'd expect -- this was actually more the story of donald woods , played by kevin kline . this was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor , and he was surprisingly good in the role . attenborough gave this the sort of direction you 'd expect , and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across . the remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job , in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past .
unfortunately , the director amos guttman died from aids-related illnesses the year after making this film , so we do n't know how many more gay-related films we might have had from him . i found this used dvd , from cinevista , on amazon , but it looks like none of his other works are still available . hessed mufla ( amazing grace ) contains full frontal male nudity , at least in magazines , which turn into a wishful dream sequence . and some drug use . this is the story of two families getting by , or trying to , but the mothers , the daughters , and the gay sons all have their own problems to figure out . jonathan ( played by gal hoyberger ) meets up with the next door neighbor thomas , who has his own problems , of course . either the translations are a little weak , or maybe guttman kept the conversation sparse on purpose , for a little mystery . watching this , i get the feeling we 're not getting the whole story , but that 's ok . throw in a cute gay roommate ex-lover miki ( aki avni , who went on to do many projects , mostly isreali tv ) lots of smoking . lots of worrying by the mothers . a great blues song `` all night long blues '' done by an unknown female artist ; if she is listed in the credits , sadly it was not translated to english . nice to see mothers and siblings treating gay relationships with respect , like any other relationship . but then , usa always has been years behind other countries in this way . a good way to spend 98 minutes ... i wanted to see even more of it . won awards at several film festivals , acc to imdb and the film jacket .
movies like this one , and c.r.a.z.y. , make me very sad for american films with a gay subject matter . with the exception of parting glances and brokeback mountain , there are few other notable american films with the kind of depth and sincerity as this movie , the bubble . this movie centers on two men , noam and ashwar , an israle and palestinian respectively . their relationship is complicated by the tension between the jews and arabs in israel . couples , in the early stages of their relationships will struggle with who will call who next , or who will say `` i love you '' first . noam and ashwar 's early love is complicated by suicide bombings , armed security check points , and racism . while noam 's friends accept and like ashwar , who is arab , it is clear that most of tel aviv 's citizens probably do n't . one of the most touching moments , and there are many in this film , is when noam and ashwar attend a production of `` bent '' . we , as movie goers , see them watching this play , and the affect it has on the two of them is profoundly captured in their eyes . and ultimately , this touching moment is played out in a very sad way in the finale of the movie . ohad knoller and youseff 'joe ' sweid are outstanding as noam and ashwar . director eytan fox is brilliant in creating a cogent and interesting retelling of the shakespeare classic romeo and juliet . and while most movies today have sex in them , ( almost as a sport ) , this one goes back to the old tried and true version of sex with love and passion combined . it is so refreshing . also refreshing is seeing two gay men being portrayed as people and not cartoons . there are cartoonish characters in this movie . it just does n't happen to be the two gay guys for a change . somewhere on this site i think i read a comparison between this movie and `` friends '' . well , not really . yes , these are youthful characters stumbling through their first uneasy steps into adulthood and relationships . but i do n't recall getting `` blowed up '' as a backdrop to the insipid story lines in `` friends '' . this is a very good movie . it has heart , and heartbreak . and like all good love stories love does win out . but not in it 's intact glory of full bloom . still , it 's a very satisfying movie to watch .
i first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and did n't really think it was anything particularly special . as time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film , which i will come to later . for a while i left this film alone and did n't watch it for a while . when looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago ( now being 15 ) , i dug out the vhs of homeward bound . after watching this i was left on a natural high that i could n't really explain . the film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect . the films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground , something that you all need . the way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic . in that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever , looking after or guiding 'chance ' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young american bulldog , with sassy the clever , vulnerable but confident cat . the film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen . i do n't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite , but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return , when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy , painfully are told by him to leave . when both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all . there is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 . this film may not be lord of the rings but for disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10 .
`` the thing about my folks '' came in as a surprise . we had no idea about what to expect . the film directed by raymond defelitta , and based on a screen play by one of its stars , paul reiser , proved to be a pleasant time at the movies . although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome , this is a voyage of discovery where ben gets to know his father , perhaps for the first time in his life , ben sees his father for what he really is , and not the mythical figure he has in his mind . the film seems to be a vehicle for its star , peter falk , and he runs away with the movie , as it was expected . mr. falk , one of the most endearing actors working in movies in this era and in past years , is an actor of such stature , he must be reckoned with . as sam kleinman , the distant father to ben , he is a man that clearly is misunderstood , not only by ben , but it appears by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven years . when muriel , the matriarch of the kleinman clan , runs away , everyone goes into a panic because this woman , who has been the strong figure of the family , is vital to keep everyone together . not knowing where she has gone , sam shows up at ben 's house confused as he feels abandoned , suddenly , by the woman he married and has been faithful for all those years . ben , the youngest son , takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can get his own family out of manhattan into the country . the trip provides the excuse for ben to bond with his father in ways he never knew about because the old man had always projected an aloof figure to his younger son . along the way , father and son realize how much they love one another and how misunderstood the old man has been by his children . the love of sam for muriel spans the many years they have known one another ; they seem inseparable . peter falk is magnificent in the film . he makes an excellent sam kleinman , the man who suddenly realizes his life is about to change for the worst . mr. falk shines as the older man and there 's never a false movement in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him . not being a paul reiser fan , we must confess that as ben kleinman , he is right . ben and his father discover how much in common they both have and their love for muriel , the mother that has sacrificed her life in order to keep the family together . olympia dukakis is only seen at the end of the film . she makes a good contribution as the fleeing mother . elizabeth perkins plays rachel with great style .. the film has a beautiful look thanks to the cinematography of dan gillham , and the excellent musical score by steven argila . ultimately , the film shows a great team effort between its director , mr. defelitta and paul reiser who wrote it for the screen . although this film is clearly targeted for an older audience , it should please anyone .
i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager , my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid . of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am , i had to go out and find this movie . now i do n't know how to put this without loosing credibility , so i 'm just going to say it , i actually had fun watching this movie ! i know that it 's stupid , not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome , but that 's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares , blood , sex , and crazy psychopaths . sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by . dr. alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness . on the day of his wedding anniversary , he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man , matt . at his dental practice , feinstone 's first patient of the day is young jody saunders , there for his very first dental appointment . feinstone begins to clean jody 's teeth . everything goes smoothly at first , until he imagines that jody 's teeth are brown and rotten . his dental pick slips , stabbing jody in the gums . jody 's mother picks up her crying , bleeding child and leaves angrily . feinstone sees his second patient , beauty queen april reign . alone with april , feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars . as she drifts off into unconsciousness , feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife . he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair , then begins to choke her . april starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas . feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons april 's blouse . feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home . later that night , brooke meets feinstone at his practice . he reveals his new italian opera-themed patient room . he encourages brooke to try out the room 's dental chair . when she does , feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide . with operatic music blaring in the background , he begins to pull out brooke 's teeth . feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness . honestly , as silly as this movie sounds , i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist . the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that i 'm sure he 'll never forget . man , i do n't think i 've brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist . yeah , i am going to warn you , this movie is in no way for the faint of heart , it 's very bloody . there 's stabbing , gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn . yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie , if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans , i slip it in my dvd player , and that 's the `` tooth '' lol ! i am so funny ! um , yeah , i try , give me a little credit . 7/10
loved joan . great performance . what is n't she good in . i watched this film and then jane eyre right after ... she just keeps getting better . my heart was racing . great old movie drama . just what i want from a classic movie . facial expressions are worth the whole film . i 'm glad i have it on video . do n't know what more you need in a film . beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... the costumes are very nice . makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie ? wish they still made films like this . whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie . films in black and white still hold a certain mystery .
this show probably wo n't appeal to everyone . sarah does what she wants ; she does n't ask for permission and she does n't apologize . this is a sitcom with zombies , robot dinosaurs , flying cars , and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders . the star of the show is not a hero , she is a spoiled , bigoted pervert . if you ca n't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers , the show probably is n't for you . everyone should at least give this show a chance . it brings together the comedic styling of sarah silverman , brian posehn ( the comedians of comedy ) , jay johnston ( mr. show ) , steve agee ( bobcat goldthwait 's 'stay ' ) and the creative energies of rob schrab and dan harmon ( heat vision & jack , monster house ) . it also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community , channel101.com . ( if you 're into this show , keep an eye out for `` the department of acceptable media '' on vh1 this march , it 'll be drawing from the same talent pool . ) watch sarah silverman 's show . this kind of stuff is the future of entertainment .
walt disney 's `` the rookie '' is based on the story of jim morris , a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history , ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his major league debut in 1999 at the age of 35 . the film opens with a brief synopsis of morris ' childhood , which included a series of re-locations - his father was a military man . and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas , morris ' passion for baseball remained strong . the childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult morris ( played by dennis quaid ) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school ( in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake , texas ) . it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it did n't work out . morris 's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams . they turn the table on him , telling him that he should try out for a major league team . at several times when he pitches to them in practice , they express amazement at the speed with which he throws . morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district , he will try out for a major league team . big lake does win district and , adhering to his end of the deal , morris attends a tampa bay devil rays try out . phenomenally , he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league pitcher . after another try out with the team , morris is offered a contract with the devil rays . this leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home . and the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children . morris signs with the devil rays , begins at the aa level and moves up quickly to the aaa level , one level below major league baseball . but as the season winds down , the chances of him getting `` called up '' grow increasingly slim . for the most part , i love this movie . there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it 's easy to find yourself really pulling for morris . also , the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels . and most of all , it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve . still , the movie has some flaws . while generally accurate , it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things . check out http : //espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples . also , except for one scene in which he prays with his players , the movie completely ignores morris ' christian faith . but considering disney 's left wing zeal , that 's not surprising . presumably , a lot of the exaggerations/fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic . yet the 20 minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie . for example , from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was 12 , morris re-located 14 times . and his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left ( pitching ) shoulder , thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable . to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris , it 's good to not only watch `` the rookie '' but to watch the dvd 's documentary , check out the aforementioned link to the movie 's inaccuracies and probably also to read morris ' biography , also titled `` the rookie . '' i have n't read the book but i hope to one of these days . but overall , `` the rookie '' is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man . 8/10
quote by nicolas martin ( nicmart ) from houston , tx : `` fine film , but dvd `` reformatted for tv '' , 8 april 2002 - this is a charming and emotive film . on the other hand , the dvd i purchased has been `` reformatted to fit your tv '' by the clods at columbia tristar . there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format , except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic , disposable trash that it is so used to producing . what a shame . '' what a ( criminal ! ) shame indeed . however , there is another version out though . see here for details http : //www.dvdbeaver.com/film/dvdcompare2/kingofmasks.htm wonderful performances by the two main actors ( the king and doggie ) btw .
i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection . matt manfredi and phil hay , movie directors , took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million eur to produce this great movie . this proves that not only big productions make great movies . the title of this movie fits in perfectly . in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function . our reactions can cause these negative side effects , but also great moments of beauty . the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug . a man witnesses the `` crime '' on the other side of the road ... from there onwards everything gets complicated ... i point out john carrol lynch ( `` fargo '' ) , wallece , the man who can not make everything right at all .
we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating . not knowing anything about this true story , i thought : `` oh , no , p.brosnan as an american indian ( 'red ' indian in the film ) , what a bad choice '' until i discovered the truth about grey owl . the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them . and annie galipeau , wow , what a beauty , and very convincing as an indian woman ( i believe she is french-canadian ; she sure reverts to the all-too familiar speech of such ) . in spite , of brosnan 's detached , grunting style , in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate , dedicated man . the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist . good film , highly recommended .
cinderella .... i had n't watched this film for about five years the last time i saw it . the magic remains . there is something that definitely contains that storybook feel , the songs entertain and the secondary character 's all please . the villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile . then there is the most magical of all disney , the mice making the dress and well you know the rest . to sum up the four of the disney princess movies are all great but this is a charming magical experience , watch and enjoy . oh and of course , cinderella is wonderful as the main character in the movie . if you think about it disney movies can really lost their charm . with elene wood and others the movie has such a feel to it , you simply ca n't help but smile they say the moral of this story is that dreams come true . of course in the real world some are believers others are hoper 's . in this film it 's even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling . and of course the rest is ... cinderella
this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village , that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old kurosawa 's works , combined with dostoyevski 's topics of human psychology ( o-shin - sonia marmeladova ) , shakespeare 's drama and hans christian andersen 's tragic and cheerfulness . the screenplay is wondrous , the scenes are colour- and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind . the plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action , so if you do n't like all the sentiments you 'd also come to your costs - . it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them , but about life , work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time . a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa , certainly worth seeing .
after becoming completely addicted to six feet under , i did n't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show . well , i was wrong ! lost is spellbinding ! ! i absolutely love this show and can not turn it off . the richness of the characters , the intricacies of the plot , the beautiful setting are all amazing . i am totally and completely hooked . i do n't know how the creators do it , but each character touches me very deeply . i feel their joy , their pain , everything , right down to my core ! ! ! i do n't have cable so i 've been renting the series on netflix . when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over . i ca n't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house . this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen ! ! !
on one level , this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again . on a deeper level though , it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land . i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said , `` when i 'm not out here ( alone ) for any length of time , i feel unrooted . '' i considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists . i 'm familiar with his works mainly through his coffee-table books and a couple art gallery installations . but to see his work in motion , captured perfectly through riedelsheimer 's lens , was a revelation . unfrozen in time , goldsworthy 's creations come alive , swirling , flying , dissolving , crumbling , crashing . and that 's precisely what he 's all about : time . the process of creation and destruction . of emergence and disappearing . of coming out of the void and becoming the universe , and back again . there 's a shamanic quality about him , verging on madness . you get the feeling , watching him at work , that his art is a lifeforce for him , that if he did n't do it , he would whither and perish . luckily for us , goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography . otherwise , with the exception of a few cairns and walls , they would only exist for one person .
i do n't think most of us would tend to apply the term `` must-see '' to action films , but i was very impressed at how good this film was and it deservedly gets the `` must-see '' stamp from me . mandy played by shannon lee ( daughter of the late and great bruce lee and sister of the late brandon lee ) is recruited by martin , a professional thief to help pull off a diamond heist at a museum for a criminal syndicate , and get rewarded handsomely for it . little do they know that another pair of thieves ( lucy and tommy , a pair of lovebirds ) , who were spurned earlier by mandy and martin to get in on the deal , are also planning to steal the diamond . how each pair of thieves plans out the heist is a thrill to watch . things go awry , as martin and mandy unknowingly find themselves a step behind lucy and tommy . you 'll find yourself rooting for these thieves as they find that they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate , who are not happy at all that the diamond is not in its hands . action fans will not be disappointed , as there 's a healthy dose of gun battles , martial arts , and hand-to-hand combat sequences . what is surprising is that , it 's not just the action that carries this film , but the romance and laughs ( and i do n't mean your typical one-liners prevalent in action films ) that sneak in . it 's not easy to root for bad guys , but we get to see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop . a great film and one not to miss ! 9 out of 10
i read holes in 5th grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic ! of course , being my busy self , i did n't get chance to see the movie in theaters . holes was at the drive-in just out of town but , alas , we were just too busy . i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me ! they all said it was good but i 've read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried . suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came . it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit . my sister , who is 9 , and i watched it and absolutely loved it ! i then took it to the other people i was babysitting 's house and their kids , 9 and 4 , liked it too . even my parents loved it and they 're deffinately movie critics . overall , i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast ! this movie should be on your top 5 `` to see '' list ! ! ! !
viewing `` impulse '' is a very satisfying experience . unpredictable films are such a rarity , when one comes along like `` impulse '' , it is something to embrace . the script is logical , and extremely creative . meg tilly , tim matheson , hume cronyn , and bill paxton , give believable performances . this could have played out like a zombie movie , but `` impulse '' is far superior to any boring `` zombiefest '' , and originality shines through in almost every scene . you get the feeling that something like this could have actually happened , even though the script is pure fiction . from the `` grabber '' opening till the credits roll , you will be fascinated . very entertaining and definitely recommended . - merk
i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles . after the film , lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them . i can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland , sweden . the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them . the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring . would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who do n't normally go to subtitled films . definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small-town community with everyday people . it is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit . a must see !
that 's what one of the girls said at the end . is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls ( or more broadly , a free-thinking group ) and the authority ? `` to germany '' means to a future that 's of hope ? it 's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience i 've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot , and mild over-acting ( though i like the cast -- they 're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs ) . the ridiculous situation is well captured . i can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game ( being female and a soccer fan ) and i can not stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise . i wonder why there 's no women 's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny . the movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title , the filming during the actual game , the spontaneity , and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that 's so important but inaccessible ( not shown ) , the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium , the confinement of the van , and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside . i can feel the comfort coming from the radio , the drinks and the food , and of course , the kindness and consideration from each character to others . during the end credits , i am amused that no character has a name -- he 's just any `` soldier '' and she 's just any `` girl '' or `` sister '' .
* what i like about spoilers * teenager holly tyler ( amanda bynes ) goes to live with older sister valerie ( jennie garth ) to avoid moving to japan with her father ; but she does n't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on , and not only to her , but to her sister , her friends gary ( wesley jonathan ) and tina ( alison munn ) , boyfriend henry ( michael mcmillian ) , crush vince ( nick zano ) , valerie 's boyfriend jeff ( simon rex ) , first boss ( then firefighter then husband ) vic ( dan cortese ) , annoying colleague lauren ( leslie grossman ) and second boss peter ( ? ) if you do n't have a funny bone in your body , please skip this ; if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this is n't for you ; if you like a funny , sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead ( and none other than the fabulous 'mary cherry ' from popular - leslie grossman - in the main cast ) , then what the hell are you waiting for ? you 're welcome to casa de tyler ! what i like about you ( 2002-2006 ) : 8 .
i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased . a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re-evaluate waterloo . so i stick orson and rita in the player and i 'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure . on the surface the story seemed a simple one , man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs , they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband , and then ............. .. well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans . michael o'hara ( orson welles } himself does n't really know what is going on , he is as confused as the viewer is , and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film . obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister ( rita hayworth } has its moments , but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped . so many wonderful things in the film , it has welles visual style all over it , see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye . the narration from o'hara is joyously self mocking , and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings . yet the film is an oddity , and in fact it 's a choppy viewing experience , because { as i was to find out after } studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour , and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer , but unfair on welles ' vision . i 'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale , as it is tho , we have a very good and intriguing film , one that sadly only hints at greatness , but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i 'm glad i own to revisit further . 8.5/10
`` they were always trying to get me killed , '' alec guinness once wrote of the man in the white suit 's technicians . `` they thought actors got in the way of things . '' he went on to describe how he 'd been given a wire rope to climb down and , assured it was safe , narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent . `` people get in the way of things '' might be a maxim tailor-made for white suit inventor sidney stratton ( fittingly played blank slate-fashion by alec guinness ) in alexander mackendrick 's definitive ealing film of 1951 . certainly , he cares only about his work , its realisation - and sod the consequences . and similarly , with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters , there 's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour . told in flashback , the film concerns stratton 's invention of a dirt-resistant , everlasting fibre ( fashioned into the white suit of the title ) , and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it . while the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market , the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job . abduction and bribery attempts follow , with both money and an industry chief 's daughter on offer ( daphne , the delectable , 4-packs-a-day-voiced joan greenwood ) , to the tragi-comic end . `` what 's to become of my bit of washing when there 's no washing to do ? '' bemoans stratton 's landlady near the close . a notion stratton had n't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie 's ambiguous coda . a superior , if decidedly downbeat comedy , expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water ...
although the film is the adaptation of the french play ( forgot the name - sorry ) , it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of georgian character . this film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness . it will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities .
after her oscar-nominated turn in `` secrets & lies '' , brenda blethyn starred in the equally great `` saving grace '' . and let me tell you , this is not the sort of movie that you find every day . after her husband commits suicide , grace trevethyn ( brenda blethyn ) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt . fortunately , she finds a way to make ends meet : marijuana . that 's right , grace starts cultivating it . every aspect of this movie was played to great effect ; there is n't a dull moment anywhere in it . and i sure did n't see that end scene coming ! but anyway , you got ta see this movie . you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it . if nothing else , it might function as a good lesson about knowing one 's finances . but of course , there 's a lot more to it than that !
reportedy based on actual historical events , this disturbingly violent , bloody , and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era . ms. bolkan 's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force . her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences : her witnessing of the hated local duke 's casual rapist activity , her forbidden love affair with a jew , her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed ( anthony corlan ) there are some painfully realistic gory sequences ( human flaying ) in this film that are not for the squeamish , but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest . deserves to be seen , if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world .
for anyone who 's judged others at first meeting , here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character . the grumpy old lady has a soft , thoughtful heart - and needs new friends . the flighty , unsure , 'ditsy ' dame who makes inappropriate , uncomfortable comments - sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all . the cold , prim , proper , neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute - given the right setting . the perfect beauty - rich , sweet , partying , pursued by throngs - wants peace , quiet , and love without possessiveness . by taking the time to look beyond the surface , you will find treasures in everyday life , from the least expected sources . all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment .
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made . it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what exactly 's going on . the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers , commercials , contests one enters by mail , and a host of other innovations . besides , what other movies have cameos by martin luther king , jr ? to decipher the film , hunt down the director 's book entitled i was curious . it 'll all become clear . it 's a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking . a triumph . now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color * other * than white ... the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible .
centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit , this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo . 'noriyuki pat morita ' is a very funny man , who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief , who has stolen a 'proto type ' turbo super charger , reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief , after being ordered by his commander . pat 's character collides with 'jay leno 's ' character , a fast talking ' but down to business-player type detroit cop . when they cross paths though , the honorable 'ways ' of japan meet the all-out old school detroit police investigative 'ways ' . the two stumble and trip over each other at first , but then develop a 'rythym ' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team , that solves the case , cold . after battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment ' and closing the case , these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together . a little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all , they manage to come to a victorious closing . i rated this a 9 . lewis 's direction makes ' this a near perfect comedy . fun for all ages . i recommend it highly . ( * * * )
for a long time i have n't seen so beautiful animated feature . having healthy respect for pixar , i must say that ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this . animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here . the graphics is amazing , the background surroundings are mind-blowing , almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly . sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i 've seen . the plot is absolutely romantic . as romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be . the characters are lovable , especially hector , the blue rabbit , he owns , pawns , rocks and rules ! the other char-s are very nice also . the humor is top-notch . generally it seemed that creators did n't invest much effort into this . i mean it looked like it did n't take em too much in difference from people of pixar & dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new . and i 'm very glad that a product of european animation studio turned out to be so great . they 've made a magnificent , touching movie , a candy for eye and heart . the only minus is stupid beginning and that 's why it 's 9of10 not 10/10
oh it 's so cool to watch a silent classic once in while ! director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy ( at least for 1928 ) cameo as himself . the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you . marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger `` drama '' studio . she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world . for a moment she even denies her ( poor ) past ! the cameos are simply hilarious , certainly the scene where the main character ( marion davies ) sees ... marion davies in the studios and concludes she does n't seem that special ... it 's got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks it 's awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then . a must-see if you ask me ! !
this is a wonderful movie with a fun , clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what 's important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie . do n't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this . keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated , because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy . great movie all around !
the odd couple is a comic gem . one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid - exceeded only by strangelove , spinal tap and lebowski ! lemmon and matthau are best friends : obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy , irresponsible oscar . oscar 's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude . felix 's wife leaves him at the start of the movie , and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar . thats when the fun begins . the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one-liners . you are probably already familiar with the `` f.u . '' joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthau 's comic timing . my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element . this one requires repeat viewings !
plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama/biopic . however the only reason i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak . i was n't disappointed - he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance . in addition i can honestly say that i was never really bored at any stage during the film , so a strong * * * 1/2 out of * * * * *
this was one of those $ .50 cent deals of yore -- -and far more complex than most realize -- -and it was in color ! not only are the effects extraordinary , vs. crap like 'earth vs. the flying saucers ' -- -the real 'killer ' is the 'universality of plot ' -- -everything hinges on two principles -- -the ancient concept of a hidden incestuous-thinking father 's desire for his daughter , and the idea of what would happen should a world 's tech reach the point where all citizen 's desires become manifest . needless to say if everyone we wished dead gets dead , not many , if any left -- -and that became the fate of the 'forbidden ' planet 's populace -- -rather modern , actually . unfortunately the 'gear ' of 'the krell ' -- -wasted by ignorance , remains , and 'morpheus ' , the incestuous father , knows how to access such tech -- -and does so , to prevent losing his daughter to another . ancient plot , beautifully rendered . and considering its age , it remains a stunning suspense , action , human-emotion classic -- -and visually very modern -- -do n't pass this one up -- -it presages all modern sci-fi -- -and its pscychological content elevates it , beyond any genre -- -a timeless work -- - and the soundtract ! you will see/hear no pure 'synth ' and perfectly syched moog background -- -a 'not miss ' -- -
let me start by saying that `` war , inc '' is not everyone 's cup of tea . it is , however , very enjoyable ( and gets you thinking - `` oh , crap '' ) . the comedy involved the film is n't obvious at all - it 's quite subtle ( tamerlane tanks , dry-cleaning service etc ) , and it changes with the twists & turns in the plot . i may be the only one , but i wo n't compare this with `` grosse point blank '' , because , it 's different . john cusack - i would n't say he was `` amazing '' or `` brilliant '' - but he was good . on the other hand , his sister ( joan cusack ) was incredible in her delivery of lines & comedic timing - even though she was hardly in the film ( i 'd say the same about ben kingsley ) . marisa tomei plays a convincing reporter , and manages to pull it off . hilary duff is very commendable for her role as central asian pop star yonica babyyeah . duff 's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film , and she does a very good job ( even though her accent is a tad unreal ) . overall , the film is what i would call `` entertaining '' . it does n't have a particular storyline , and it 's quite silly at times , but it does have a subtle message . i 'd say it 's worth a watch .
probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made , this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last . director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what 's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen . not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn , but the setting is absolutely out of this world ! just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging , pervasive fog . this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbar 's inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players . the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine , beautiful , spirited yet vulnerable . robert barrat delivers his usual no-nonsense , straight-down-the-line portrait of the local bigwig , though it 's hard to believe that the personable , good-looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer/director blake edwards .
if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor , then you will enjoy this flick . i do n't understand why anyone would n't enjoy this one . take it for what it is : a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh . it ai n't shakespeare , but it is well done . ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - better than any episode of baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor . too bad she has n't had many opportunities to expand on that . tom berenger fits his role of `` real navy '' perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a hustler . throw in a walk-on by hopper in the middle of the chase for `` the cherry on this sundae '' and you 've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing . i bought this one as soon as it was available . brain-candy .
the sword fighting was out of this world , the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques ( until the end ) that are way too common today . the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie . the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were cliché but the movie is comfortable with it . an injection of humour from woo . the plot with it 's twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you could n't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on . a good sense of suspense and well timed surprises . the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung-fu flicks do n't .
othello , the classic shakespearen story of love , betrayal , lies , and tragedy . i remember studying this story in high school , actually i found othello to be probably my favorite shakespeare story due to the fact of how fascinating it was , the fact that shakespeare captured the feeling of friendship , love , and racism perfectly . i mean , when you really do study this story , you could go into so many philosophies on why othello went insane with jealousy in the blink of an eye . but later on for my report i also watched this version of othello and i have to say that it was absolutely brilliant . lawerance and kenneth just capture the story so well and understood it 's darkness . othello is the big time soldier in his city , he is loved by everyone , including the king . but when the king finds out that othello snuck off with his daughter , desdemona , the king is infuriated , but excepts it . othello is welcome in the city and makes his best friend , cassio , his side man instead of iago , who has stood by othello . due to his insane jealousy , he 's out for revenge . still pretending to be othello 's best friend , he just mearly hints at othello that desdemona is cheating on him with cassio , never says that they are , just makes othello think that it 's happening . othello is driven insane and does n't have pleasant plans for desdemona or cassio and iago is more than happy to help him out . othello is an incredible story , i highly recommend that you read it . it 's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after you 've read it . othello the movie is also great and once again i recommend it , it captured the story perfectly and has a big tearjerker type of feel , or you could just be in utter shock of what happens between othello and desdemona , how quickly he believes that his true love would betray him . this is a terrific movie , great acting , good sets , and good direction , this is what shakespeare meant when he wrote the story . 10/10
the history of the fbi , as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks , interwoven with his personal life story . stewart and miles ( as his wife ) are pretty good , as is hamilton as an earnest agent . the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved . it 's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who 's who cast of gangsters . some of the episodes are too long , some too short , and some just look out of place ( stewart 's daughter 's school sequence ) . overall , it goes on way too long . nevertheless , it 's worth a look for its handsome production values .
starting off , here 's a synopsis : porno queen alta lee ( lynn lowry ) is murdered by her pornographer lover max ( george shannon ) in a game of sexual russian roulette . alta 's other lover , icy lesbian casting agent camila stone ( mary woronov ) , provides an alibi for max . but camila has an agenda of her own , and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie ( lynn again ) in a web of sexual mind games . when the lookalikes ' identities are sufficiently blurred , the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter . though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention , i find it to be a sexy , suspenseful gem . cult goddess woronov has one of her best-ever roles , and she and sexy-innocent lowry play off each other well . the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley , plus two original songs ( `` all-american boy , '' `` you say you 've never let me down '' ) and the jaynetts ' `` sally , go 'round the roses '' compose a memorable soundtrack . theodore gershuny 's direction is sharp , with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society 's upper crust . with tons of great new york atmosphere , ondine ( woronov 's friend and fellow warholite ) giving a great performance in a small role , and exotic monique van vooren as max 's ex-wife in a comic sub-plot . this sub-plot , though amusing , looks like it belongs in another movie altogether . however , i 'm not complaining , as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out . trivia : sugar cookies was originally rated x ( soft-core ) and released by general film corporation in 1973 . i am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster -- lucky me ! in 1977 , the movie was cut for an r and re-released by troma team , which now offers it uncut on videotape . mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time , and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera . she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions , kemek ( 1970 ) and silent night , bloody night ( 1972 ) .
as many people know , mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called golden age of the mexican cinema , fortunately , during the late 90 's , and early 21st century , great movies like la ley de herodes , bajo california , amores perros , y tu mamá también and , of course , el coronel no tiene quien le escriba , appeared . el coronel ... , is a wonderful movie , that retells the classic story by gabriel garcía márquez , by eliminating the magic realism elements , and replacing them with the crude reality lived in mexico , not only by people like the colonel , who wait for their pensions , but by more than the half of the mexican population , who live in complete poverty . the film 's characters , satirically represent classic characters found in mexican society , such as the nationalist colonel , the cold and even ambitious priest , the hypocrite , but at the same time loyal compadre , the tolerant and patient wife , the hidden homosexual , etc . this movie , is a must-see if you want to know more about mexican society , and specially , if you want to watch a gorgeous movie , by one of mexico 's finest directors
with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i 've started listening to his music , watching the odd documentary here and there , watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again . maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent . moonwalker is part biography , part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released . some of it has subtle messages about mj 's feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m'kay . visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring . some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him . the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord . why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me . because mj overheard his plans ? nah , joe pesci 's character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno , maybe he just hates mj 's music . lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence . also , the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene . bottom line , this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another ( which i think is most people ) . if not , then stay away . it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj 's bestest buddy in this movie is a girl ! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty ? well , with all the attention i 've gave this subject .... hmmm well i do n't know because people can be different behind closed doors , i know this for a fact . he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars . i hope he is not the latter .
i was literally preparing to hate this movie , so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing . overall , the story and gags are contrived , but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off . that gag where jason lee thinks he has crabs , and tries not to let his boss/future father-in-law and co-workers see him scratching himself is n't terribly intelligent , but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter . very few of the film 's gags are high-brow , but they made me laugh . as i said , the film has charm and charm can go a long way . the characters are likable , too . i must say i wish i got to see more of james brolin 's character , since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in . plus , i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife ( who serves as the obstacle in the plot ) a total witch . the selma blair character is hardly unlikable , and there 's never a scene where i thought to myself , `` why did he want to marry her in the first place ? '' the ending is hollywood-ish , but it could 've been much more schmaltzy . the cast is talented . i have n't had a favorable view of most of jason lee 's mainstream work . i just loved him so much in kevin smith 's films that i could n't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles . and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles . even in this movie , he does n't look perfectly comfortable , but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene . but i still miss his work in independent films . julia stiles proves again why she 's so damn likable . of course , she 's a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint , but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality . in other words , her beauty shows inside and out . i do n't know the actresses ' name , but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious . julie hagerty also has a small part , and she 's always enjoyable to watch , which makes me wish she received better roles . i loved her so much in `` airplane '' and `` lost in america '' that it 's a shame she does n't get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills . do n't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records . this is a funny , charming film . romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet , so it 's always to see a good one among all these bad apples . my score : 7 ( out of 10 )
this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion . from the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator , you 'll be entranced . it 's an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology . interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great . not overly done either . i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history , too . how the police work with the political party being what it was ... it is truly fascinating and frustrating . the settings are beautiful . it 's been a while since i saw this movie the first time . it does n't diminish it 's impact . not overly dramatic or graphic , it leaves enough to the imagination , well , you 'll see .
... so what 's in those missing 10 minutes that were so horrible they had to cut them out from the original film ? we were three years into the film production code ... barbara stanwyck had starred in the original play , but here , carole lombard plays maggie king . co star fred macmurray is probably best known for `` double indemnity '' , with stanwyck , as well as his hit tv show `` my three sons '' . keep an eye out for a young dorothy lamour ( bob hope movies ) and the too-fabulous franklin pangborn , who spiced up just about every film put on tape . of course , he works in the beauty salon on the ship ! add the sublime charles butterworth and anthony quinn . good timing and clever banter at the beginning . maggie 's buddy ella is played by jean dixon , who was the best friend in `` holiday '' and `` my man godfrey '' . in `` swing high '' , maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army . maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier . the dashing 20-something quinn has a small scene at the local bar in panama where johnson ( macmurray ) has been playing the trumpet . maggie , harry ( butterworth ) , and skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states . some good singing by lamour . good ( but brief ) acting performance by cecil cunningham as `` murph '' , the wise , helpful owner of the local saloon in panama . while others have lamented at how bad it is , it was n't so awful , and is even a little exotic , with the fake central america locale setting for the first half of the film .
this movie surprised me ! not ever having heard of hyde of gackt i was not expecting much ! the reason i wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in john woo style ! normally i am very careful when this is claimed ! there is only one john woo and til this day there has n't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action ! the fact that `` moon child '' would feature a vampire convinced me even more ! how can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires ! sounds promising and interesting ! the first thing i noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow ! it takes it 's time to set the mood ! this movie contains some nice hong kong style action scenes ! but `` moon child '' is n't an action movie ! it is a drama about friendship and loyalty ! the focus is on the characters and their relation to each other ! the pop singers hyde and gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends ! the only problem i had was with the plot ! a couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip ! example : when one member of the gang dies ( very dramatic moment ) alexander wang sees kei ( hyde ) drinking blood of one of the attackers ! without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends are n't together anymore ! also without a proper reason given son ( alexander wang ) and sho ( gackt ) have to kill each other ! i know that this is done to add some serious drama ! because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced ! apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie ! it is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful ! but it just is ! the overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere !
okay , but just plain dumb . not bad for a horror/comedy film . i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe ( never seen it ) the horror ( possibly comedy ) uncle sam , i 'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21 , the day before thanksgiving . worth the four bucks , l.o.l . at this film . 9/10
entertaining musical where nathan detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices sky masterson to try and get salvation army girl , played by jean simmons , to go with masterson to havana . 5 years later , simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous `` elmer gantry . '' there she was sister sharon and here she is sister sarah . same temperament , different story . frank sinatra is that devilish nathan detroit . he has been engaged to vivian blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit . in a real change of pace , sky masterson was played by marlon brando who actually did his own singing here ! the film is saved by superlative choreography . those dance and singing routines are fabulous . they are especially realized by stubby kaye as nicely nicely ( johnson ) . all in all , it 's a very nice production .
* * possible spoilers * * the biggest part of the movie that does n't work is the wendigo , and when your title character fails , your movie usually is n't far behind it . the filmmakers ' interpretation of the wendigo 's form is interesting , and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror , for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good . however , as a monster character it never really comes to life . we do n't get much of an explanation for its behavior , and what we do see from it does n't jibe with either the story told in the movie itself , or any wendigo lore i 've ever read . i think one of the main reasons that the monster fails is that it is n't given enough to do , in the movie . when you boil this film down to its bones , what you have is a suspense thriller with a little bit of a supernatural element , instead of a movie about a monster . the cinematography is good , though a little cheesy ; the filmmakers use scenery , lighting , and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood rather well . the character of otis comes across as truly dangerous and unpredictable , making him the real monster in the film . it might have been more effective to explain his behavior as him being possessed by the hungry spirit of the wendigo , which would also be a more accurate representation of the real legend . i have heard unconfirmed reports ( from a newsgroup ) that the reason the wendigo does n't do much is that , when the monster suit was built , it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable ( in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves , the performer had to walk on his toes ) that it was nearly impossible to run , walk , or otherwise perform in it . thus the many flashes of the creature standing still , and the obvious sped-up footage of it running . i stress that these reports are uncomfirmed .
this might contain a spoiler , so beware . if it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people , does it make a difference ? sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of ( strangely very loud ) americans , but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone . god help us for what we have done . after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans , and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race , you would think we 'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60 's and early 70 's . but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us . how then , can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will ? we are contradictory and hypocritical , and i am ashamed for this . i feel sorrow for the people affected . they deserve justice and their homes back . if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety , i do n't want it . i denounce these actions , and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit . no one is above the law . i want my country back , and so do the chagos islanders . regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers , no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports . we ca n't stand to be stuck in traffic , let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes . 'not one of us , brit and american alike forget what goes around comes around . do n't buy into the fallacy that a simpler , more natural civilization is somehow less worthy of having their rights observed , and preserved - when we turn our backs on the basic human rights and dignities of 2000 , we turn away from the basic human rights and dignities of all men .
this movie has it all . sight gags , subtle jokes , play on words and verses . it is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy . if you watch this more than once , you will find you are quoting it like animal house ( and yes i love animal house also ) . i put in the top 15 funniest movies . the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble ( in this movie he is right ) . he is sadistic , uncaring , cruel and has to be taken down . the group of boys that do not get along at first , end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote . a must see - you will love it !
may and her husband go to visit their children and grandchildren . the visit is awkward because the grandchildren and `` kids '' do n't really seem to know each other as one might expect . the warmth that should be there is missing . after dinner , may 's husband says he does n't feel well , blames it on his daughter 's cooking , and irritably says he wants to go home . he dies that night . may , now a widow , is lost . she clearly did not have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one , but she had a purpose . she had someone who needed her , and even though her own needs had gone unmet for years , she had something to do with her days . she is depressed and unmotivated . she goes to stay with her daughter , paula , who shortly after her mother 's arrival , lets her mother know that she has never felt that her mother has given much of herself at all . she lets loose with anger over her mother 's lack of nurturing . may seems disarmed and surprised , yet she also does n't seem to have the energy or the desire to really make it right . `` i 'm your mother and i love you . '' what does really say ? ( i 've heard this from my own mother way too many times and have yet to figure out what it means . ) paula is a bit ( well , more than a bit ) neurotic . both women are needy , though they show it very differently . paula has been involved with a friend of her son 's , darren , who is a handyman working on the house owned by her son . while paula is working during the day , may begins to have conversations and lunches with darren . darren is a married man who has stayed with his wife because of their autistic son , nicky , but supposedly does n't live in the home with his wife . may becomes attracted to darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they seem to have . darren becomes attracted to may because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from the other women in his life . ( he also becomes too interested in money that may says she can give him to `` get away from it all , '' though he is clearly not interested in her desire to join him on such a journey . they end up sleeping together in the spare room during the day , and may enjoys fulfillment as a woman that she has not known in years , nor had ever expected to know again . as her daughter paula had often told her that she would leave the married darren , this becomes part of may 's rationalization that what she is doing is okay . at a writing group that paula leads , may is introduced , rather forced to get together with a widower to whom she is not attracted . there is one scene where she has sex with the older man , who clearly can barely perform , and it truly painful and unsettling as we see the total disgust on may 's face as she endures the one-time ghastly liaison . eventually , paula discovers through some very graphic sketches done by her mother , that indeed her mother and darren have been having sex . this film will undoubtedly be seen by many in myriad ways . sympathies will be divided . at one point , during paula 's writing group , may reveals through a short essay that she used to feel as though she hated her kids by the end of the day , and would leave for pubs after they were asleep , making sure to get back home before her husband . clearly , a good mother does not think of leaving children alone while she goes off to the local pub . may , however , also had revealed earlier in the film that her husband did n't like her having any friends , so she did n't have any . she did what he wanted her to do . she was miserable but she put up with it because , as she said , `` it was easier . '' so , while may was not the best mother , for those inclined to have any sympathy for her , one might see may 's actions as the act of a woman just wanting to be sexual and to be a live for `` a few minutes '' in her lifetime . a woman who just wanted someone to listen to her , to know her as a human being , to have a friend and a lover . paula , though neurotic and unhappy , perhaps has become that way because of the distant parents who raised her . certainly , it is not difficult to understand why paula feels completely betrayed by her mother . it is a well-done film , with more complexities than i have mentioned , and certainly one that will leave the viewer with many , perhaps conflicting , reactions . it is a film worth discussing and debating , and above all , worth seeing . one thing the film leaves us with is the horror and fear of a lonely life . no matter who is deemed `` right '' or who is deemed 'wrong '' by each viewer , that theme of old age and loneliness , evoking a sense of dread in most of us , is inescapable .
whoever said that horror was n't an educational film genre , huh ? thanks to this marvelous hammer short movie , i now at least know never to offer a strange visitor any wine and a slice of bread with salt in my own house , because he might just be hypnotist and this combination will give him the power to control my thoughts & mind forever ! thank you hammer ! the tenth episode in the house of horror series is another one i 've been looking forward to seeing , mainly because the guy in the director 's chair was don sharp ; one of britain 's finest filmmakers but still sadly underrated . sharp was responsible for some very cool hammer films , like `` kiss of the vampire '' and `` rasputin : the mad monk '' , as well as some overlooked independent productions like `` dark places '' and `` psychomania '' . his contribution to house of horror is easily one of the best in the series , with a complex yet fascinating plot outline and revolving on delightful occult themes . the plot centers on two antique dealers that stumble upon a strange object resembling a mirror , but it 's actually an ancient scrying device that can be used to summon choronzhon ; the demonic guardian of the abyss . the mirror is heavily desired by a satanic cult since they need it for their ceremonies , but michael is reluctant to sell it before knowing the real value of the device . when he picks up a clearly petrified girl who 's running from the cult to avoid being sacrificed , michael is drawn even deeper into an occult conspiracy . satanic cults and the carnal sacrifice of young women are typical british horror topics , but david fischer 's screenplay is never dull and offers plenty of neat plot twits , among which a highly inventive climax . there 's also plenty of tension to admire , the dialogs are wit and the acting performances are splendid ( especially john carson as the leader of the cult is genuinely eerie ) . recommended !
this movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better . the last one , heaven can wait , was great , i suggest you see that one . this one is not so great . the last third of the movie is not so bad and chris rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today . however , i do n't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie . it plays like some really bad `` b '' movie where people sound like they are in some bad tv sit-com . the situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie . it all seems real fake and the editing is just bad . i do n't know how they could release this movie like that . anyway , the last part is n't to bad , so wait for the video and see it then .
`` atlantis : the lost empire '' was everything the previews indicated it would be . it is not often you find that . most of the time , the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible . not so with this one . i was pleased with the original plot , even though the sub-plots were not . the animation was not break through like `` shrek '' but it was good , none the less . the plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them . this keeps you interested . i found myself enjoying this one . `` atlantis '' gets and keeps your attention . you also have to think a little bit , but not too much . once you think about it a little , you can figure out what needs to happen but you really do n't know for sure how it is going to happen . the casting was also good . michael j . fox , as milo was an excellent choice . his personality fits nicely . the gruff natured commander rourke was also well chosen with james garner . his character reminded me of his performance in `` maverick '' which i also liked . i really liked the casting of claudia christian as helga sinclair . her ability to play a no nonsense personality makes the film more interesting . it 's just too bad she is a villain . over all , definitely worth you while ( 8 out of 10 ) .
i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about 6 or 7 years old . i loved it then , and have recently come to own a vhs version . my 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it . i have enjoyed watching it again too . though i have to admit it is not as good on a little tv . i do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it . the songs are very cute . my daughter keeps singing them over and over . hope this helps .
after some difficulty , johnny yuma arrives at his ailing uncle 's ranch to take over day to day operations , only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the woman 's vicious brother . good production values , a likable performance by mark damon , and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining , if not exceptionally deep , above average addition to the spaghetti western genre . co-star rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen . here she 's absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user ( and abuser ) of weak men . damon and neri appeared together in at least one other picture , the devil 's wedding night , a pretty good horror movie that 's of particular interest for those of you that want to see what 's underneath rosalba 's dresses .
lisa baumer ( ida galli ) is the adulteress wife of a big businessman who inherits $ 1million life insurance when her husband is killed in a plane crash while on a business trip .initially she is suspected of being responsible as her husbands will had recently been changed and so she has an insurance investigator peter lynch ( george hilton ) and an interpol agent on her tail just to be sure . baumer travels to athens , greece to cash in her inheritance , but insists on having it in cash ... a dangerous turn of events . lynch who 's identity is now known to baumer tries to protect her against a lover of her husband lara florakis who nevertheless along with her henchman sharif tries to kill them both for a share of the money that she deems she is entitled to . and this is where our masked killer starts his/her brutal killings . lynch as is customary with our hero is at first suspected by the greek police and is warned not to leave athens by police inspector stavros ( luigi pistilli a familiar face in giallo and spaghettis ) . lynch is then aided by the gorgeous cléo dupont ( anita strindberg ) a local journalist who helps him investigate the killings.to say any more could ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it , so suffice to say there are enough red herrings and most of them plausible to keep mystery/thriller fans happy in this story driven giallo.the no shame dvd has a superb transfer with both english and italian soundtrack . it also has a very catchy score just for good measure by bruno nicolai that will stay in your head for a while .... all in all a first rate giallo .
noni hazlehurst , colin friels , alice garner , chrissie amphlett and michael caton- what more could you ask for ? monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora ( hazlehurst , a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe ( friels ) . a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting ( in particular noni hazlehurst ) and nice use of the small budget . the only flaw is ( if you can pick it up ) is that the story is set in melbourne , although for budget reasons , the film was mainly shot in sydney , so as a result , in a few scenes you see trams ( melbourne scenes ) and then a carlton post office ( sydney scenes ) . other than that , `` monkey grip '' is a must see ( excuse the clique , but it is ) at least for an award winning performance from former `` play school '' and `` better homes & gardens '' presenter noni hazlehurst . 10/10
it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i do n't really like dogs . fox , field , and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance , sassy and shadow , and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing . i have seen this movie 72 times already ( i know that sounds scary , but it 's true ! ) , and every time the ending scenes still get me . i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers . it is indeed my all-time favorite movie !
anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie . the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping , who also did the fights in the matrix . and the fight scenes are somethin . li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain , who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ( ya got me ) . when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade , li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them . there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie ( one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices ) . the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ; the body count is way up there . li has seldom been better , and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars ( yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier ) . anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord ( no suprises there ; he makes a cameo in every hk movie ) . it 's unfortunate they do n't make action movies like this in the us ; i would n't have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much . recommended .
good for an evening 's entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing . garrison 's affair with the first lady was unreal and passionless ; the president was a cardboard cut-out . and who were the real villains anyway ? nothing was developed or explained sufficiently . i still do n't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved . the villains were nameless and undeveloped , so you never felt involved in their plot . michael douglas and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story - the chase and confrontation were good . but kim basinger and eva longoria were both unbelievable in their roles , basinger totally lacked character and no way could longoria have been a secret service agent . this could have been a very good film but somehow it missed the way , with too many unanswered questions . disappointing on the whole despite some very good scenes . and did they use the 'west wing ' set for the white house scenes ? - i kept expecting cj or charlie to appear !
the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films . it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being . if you 're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach , you 'll like this film .
`` pet sematary '' is an adaptation from the stephen king novel of the same title . the story follows the creeds - an all american , middle-class family , who move into a house out in the country . the family consists of louis and rachel , and their two young children , ellie and their toddler son , gage . the house could n't be better , and the family meets a strange but friendly old man , jud , who lives across the road . he leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies - filled with a huge amount of animal graves . and just beyond there , lies a sacred indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power . when the family cat , church , is killed , louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery - and strangely enough , soon after , church returns to life . but there 's something evil about him now , he is n't the same cat he used to be . and when a tragic accident takes the life of young gage , louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son ... unfortunately , he gets more than he bargained for . having read stephen king 's novel , i can say that the book is much better than the film . not to say the movie is bad , because it is n't - the book is just a little bit better . the real strength in this film lies in it 's story , which is both bizarre but extremely original , something that king 's stories are typically known for . the script is very well adapted from the story , and while it minorly differs in some aspects , it 's a pretty good page-to-screen transformation . there are a few plot holes here and there , nothing major though . besides that , this movie is actually pretty scary , and it succeeds in it 's intention to do so . there are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film , and i 'd have to say that the flashback sequence of rachel 's sister zelda is the number one . honestly , that is one of the most disgusting , disturbing things i 've ever seen in a horror film - it 's not gory and bloody , it 's just flat out sickening . one thing 's for sure , that image wo n't leave your head anytime soon . the performances in this film were all very up to par and i really had no problem there . this film is actually on the gory side , there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there , including the shocker of an ending . i really liked the way they ended the film , it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive , but it worked better that way with all things considered . overall , `` pet sematary '' is a good horror movie that i 'd recommend to those who are fans of either stephen king or just fans of the genre in general . the story is the film 's greatest asset and it 's a creepy one too . one of the better stephen king adaptations i 'd say . 7/10 .
the only reason i came across this movie was that it 's on the little miss marker dvd and i do recommend watching it although you wo n't like it as well as the better known movie . we have gary cooper and carole lombard as a con man and his companion . the film starts out quite light , but becomes more dramatic as coop first plans on using his daughter to extort a sizable amount of cash from his brother-in-law but upon meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with his brother-in-law elects to keep her . however , he has trouble staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops . cooper and lombard are good and shirley still manages to steal the scenes she 's in . there 's little music in this , and shirley only has one song . however this is entertaining and worth watching along with little miss marker .
this movie is difficult to watch in our fast-paced culture of the 21st century , but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys , chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society , specifically when that technology is used for warfare . this movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology , but as the circle completes itself , familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self-serving rather than self-destructive ways that humanity may utilize technology . brilliant for it 's time , the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some , but as a landmark in the history , development , and evolution of the sci-fi genre , it is a must . in the end , free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed , the state of society itself , as shaped by world events . those who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so , but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains , as this film posits . as far as qualifying as sci-fi , one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is it 's speculative nature . it asks us the questions , what if these events happened this way , and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it ? how would we react ? as far as influence , this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci-fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions .
i have seen the movie at the viennale a few years ago , where the audiences liked it . i liked it as well , summer phoenix performance still haunts me , that´s why i decided to write a comment . the story unfolds in london around 1900 , where a jewish girl decides to become an actress . she tries desperately to become one , but it isn´t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage , that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being . there were certain reviews , were her performance was smashed , they accused her of being dull , not able to bring life to her character . i think that´s her strong point , that´s exactly what esther kahn should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl . so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise . the cinematography is great , the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad , you can see how unpleasant life was back then . the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie , you loose touch with the characters , after all it´s only about finding the actor in yourself , so there are no dramatic actions in the film . it´s phoenix credit that we don´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour .
brothers with psychokinetic powers ( yes , really ) duel not just for debra winger 's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers . there are surreal touches ( the fire brigade that act like a singing greek chorus ) , but there is also humour , wit and romance . the soundtrack is great also . and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song they could get ~ but with fire and i do n't think i 'll ever forget dennis quaid ( mmmmm dennis quaid ) , setting his own trailer a rockin ' too 'she 's a lady ' ~ priceless ; ) best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'once you 've had a clown , you never go back ! ' i love this movie ( i just ordered the dvd from the us ) and if the comments written by the kind of people who 'd be happier with legally blond 3 do n't put you off ~ give it a try : )
get this film if at all possible . you will find a really good performance by barbara bach , beautiful cinematography of a stately ( and incredibly clean ) but creepy old house , and an unexpected virtuoso performance by `` the unseen '' . i picked up a used copy of this film because i was interested in seeing more of bach , whom i 'd just viewed in `` the spy who loved me . '' i love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little . so : we start with a nice fresh premise . tv reporter bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a california town , solvang , that celebrates its swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival . she brings along a camerawoman , who happens to be her sister , and another associate . ( the late karen lamm plays bach 's sister , and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to , it is just too funny watching bach ( mrs. ringo starr ) and lamm ( mrs. dennis wilson ) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel . ) ) anyway bach 's disgruntled beau follows her to solvang , as he 's not done arguing with her . there 's a lot of feeling still between them but she does n't wan na watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career . the ladies arrive in solvang to do the assignment for their station , only to find their reservations were given away to someone else . ( maybe to bach 's boyfriend , because think of it  where 's he gon na stay ? ) . the gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go . mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum , they catch the interest of proprietor mr. keller ( the late sidney lassick ) , who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home , insisting his wife will be happy to receive them . oh no ! next thing we know keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife , warning her that company 's coming and threatening that she 'd better play along . trouble in paradise ! the ladies are eager to settle in and get back to solvang to shoot footage and interview swedes , but one of the girls does n't feel good . bach and lamm leave her behind , wondering to themselves about mrs. keller ( played heartbreakingly by pretty lelia goldoni ) who looks like she just lost her best pal . speaking of which under-the-weather vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub , not realizing that keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole . she hears him , thinks he 's come to deliver linen , and calls out her thanks . lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who did n't get a long enough look . after he 's left , poor vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast ( in a really decent , frightening round of action ) by something big that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor the unseen ! lamm comes home next ( bach is out finishing an argument with her beau ) and ca n't find anyone in the house . she knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen , and , on hands and knees to collect it , her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille attracting the unseen again ! well , at about the time poor lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen , we do a flashback into mr. keller 's past and get the full story of what his sick , sadistic background really is and why his wife does n't smile much . bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are . meanwhile , lassick has been apprised of the afternoon 's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he ca n't let bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home . he tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us . i can not say enough for stephen furst , whom i 'd never seen before ; it 's obvious that he did his homework for this role , studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged ; bach and goldoni , each in their diverse way , just give the movie luster . not only that , but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution . no stupid cheap tricks , eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners ... a real treat for your collection .
if this movie proves only one thing , it 's that keaton is , was and always will be a comic at heart , even when dodging bullets , heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison . but `` johnny dangerously '' goes on to prove even more . in the '80s , the zaz boys ( zucker , abrahams , zucker ) were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs . but there were several pretenders to the throne . this time , amy ( `` fast times at ridgement high '' ) heckerling tries her hand , with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script ( go and check ) . this slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930 's cops-and- '' gag '' sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that did n't exist way back when . and not only is the ever-dependable keaton on hand as the johnny of the title , but so are such funny guys and dolls as piscopo , henner , stapleton , boyle , dunne , devito , walston and just about every other actor in hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity . you 'd be surprised by how many faces you 'll recognize . i know i was . and the jokes ? well , when they start out , they come at you fast and furious , like a machine gun . there are too many to count in the beginning , topped off with a crazy theme song by weird al yankovic . but you have to watch for when they reload . and they have to reload a little too often . everyone tries , they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time . in the end , though , there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy . but for a slow night when there 's nothing good on tv , pop in `` johnny '' and be ready for some `` dangerously '' serious laughter . eight stars . check out `` johnny dangerously '' ... do n't be a `` bastidge '' .
i totally got drawn into this and could n't wait for each episode . the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be , together with the effects it would have on those closest . the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all 'explained ' at the end . we could n't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what gary 's part in the whole thing was ? why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it ? having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion . i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either . very strange but maybe we missed something crucial ? ? ? ?
with the death of george nader , on 4 february 2002 , i thought of this most interesting program , which even though it had only a short run , was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout . generally unseen for over 40+ years it would be worth viewing again . the opening credits showed many differing images , one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp , riding his famed rocket sled , at the point where he was often referred to as `` the fastest man alive '' .
if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people , this is a tough movie to watch , at least in the second half of it . it 's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded ( mentally- challenged ) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child . it 's not pleasant material . however , it 's a good movie and the acting is good , too . the story will sit with you awhile . `` dominick '' is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by tom hulce . i think this might be hulce 's best role ever . he 's looked after by a med student , `` eugene , '' played by ray liotta , who became a star the following year with kevin costner 's `` field of dreams . '' dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads `` hulk '' comic books and loves wrestling . he 's the type of `` slow '' guy that you ca n't help but love and root for to live a happy life . when he freaks out , it 's for several good reasons and ... well , see the film for the whole story . it 's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see .
there 's the danger with the critic/philosopher slavoj zizek with his film , directed by sophie fiennes , which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent , horror , sci-fi , surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload . but in the pervert 's guide to cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis i 've seen on a collective section of films . while it does n't cover the expansive territory scorsese 's movie documentaries cover , the same attachments are there , and zizek has a definite love for all of these `` perverse '' examples and films , primarily the work of hitchcock , lynch , chaplin and tarkovsky . yet one should n't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is , i got to see it almost by luck- thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse , deranged manner . if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id , super-ego and ego ( harpo 's example is most dead-on for me ) . he 's not just one to take on the classics though , he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former , and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one 's own self as well as ones double in the latter . he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader , and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children 's births happens elsewhere . the ideals of fatherhood , male sexuality , the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality ( at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare 's creation ) , and female subjectivity , are explored perhaps most dead-on with vertigo . this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if it 's the zapruder film , where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'do n't you look at me ' scene in blue velvet . now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere , excited , and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as scorsese does . but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality , and how they overlap , intersect , become one and the same , or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters ( i.e . lost highway ) by putting himself in the locations the films take place in . funniest is first seeing him in the boat `` heading '' towards the same dock tippi hedren 's boat heads to at the beginning of the birds ; equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of frank booth ; only one , when he 's in solaris-like territory , does it seem a little cheesy . but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up , and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizek 's words come through . there were some films i of course would 've expected , chiefly from hitchcock and lynch , but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the pervert 's guide of cinema ( top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplin 's films , albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice ' ) , and the ones that one has n't seen yet ( i.e . the ventriloquist horror film , dr. mabuse , stalker , among a few others ) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow , i have to see that immediately , no questions asked . ' zizek is a powerful writer with his work , and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place , to be entertained , sure , but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there , as he put it , looking into a toilet . it 's probably one of the greatest films about cinema , and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire , the id/super-ego/ego , and of the supernatural in fantasy , that you may never see ... unless distribution finally kicks in , if only on the smallest levels .
beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature . forbidden lie $ ( 2007 ) is simply a better ( cinematic ) version of norma khouri 's book forbidden love , and that was a best-seller . an onion-peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman , lie $ is the very best in editorialised reality tv . cleverly edited and colourful , broinowski 's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke . i disagree ( with variety ) that it 's overlong ; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others ' just-recorded testimonials . on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired ..... so i watched it twice . this oscar-worthy effort is at once genuinely funny , upsetting , and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another . the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri 's friends and fans ( ! ) . clearly these friends are now `` turned '' , the funniest on-camera line belonging to khouri 's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no-nonsense colloquialisms : `` i think it 's a load of sh ! t . personally '' . we need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . any perennial lie-spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . there 's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her ( con ) '' artist '' repeatedly for corroboration . since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication , khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . she absconded supposedly because a ) she 's either terrified of her sly , more-italian-sounding-than-greek husband , or b ) because she needed her passport/visas to clear her name . unlikely . a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas ( one guess : no , not jordan ) . according to a closing card , khouri is `` still under investigation by the fbi '' in 2007 . i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . instead , the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . once they caught on , there was plenty counter-derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just did n't know how to take khouri 's evolving contradictions . the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out -- not even her own self-sacrifice . anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself . the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first -- key to how a lifelong liar operates : in half-truths . khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr-old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked-out biceps . gradually we 're introduced to less-and-less-adulating aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri 's honour-killing accusations hook , line and sinker . later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self-controlled and matter-of-fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . it was jordanian ( anti- ) honour-killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri 's fallacies because its pot-stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . honour-killings do happen in jordan ; it 's just their prevalence that 's at odds with khouri 's book -- plus 72 other `` facts '' . in 2003 these activists faxed ( australian ) random house with 73 painstakingly-checked objections . the publishing houses across 4 continents who 'd jumped at the chance to publish first-time author khouri never tried to check any facts . leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . so a massive hot-topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes . later still we 're shocked to discover that the `` factual errors '' extend to khouri 's bio as well . for one thing , she 's not only not a 35yr-old virgin ( her defence is that she merely did n't disabuse people of their assumptions ) , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! sometimes she 's just too fast-talking in her american accent . she also seems too-comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes . i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who do n't need any western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues do n't jibe in addition to khouri 's `` facts '' , you 've got to start questioning your source . at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account , in person , in jordan . the last third is consumed with a fact-finding trip back to amman , where one `` fact '' after another falls . eventually broinowski forces her ( con ) '' artist '' to admit the decade-discrepancy in her story , and it 's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . secret , because in it khouri 's `` american security guard '' jeremy is heard to have an australian accent : he 's an actor ! ( we never find out how anna uncovered it . ) so this becomes the filmmaker 's triumph , as she never flags in her tone or commitment . her on-camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt , fbi documents -- and khouri 's most shocking initial crime . anna broinowski ( watch-list her now ) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device ( key players cross-commenting on footage ) to kill two birds -- making her audiences want to drink from the same well again . in fact , despite her deceptively demure approach , she made me re-confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their `` norma khouri investigation '' . broinowski made me look . ( 10/10 )
this is one military drama i like a lot ! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett . this marine is no-nonsense , in your face , and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done . there you have billy zane ( `` the phantom '' and others ) who plays richard miller , a former swat form d.c. , works for the government and takes orders only from them . who needs a bureaucrat ? i do n't ! when these two are paired , sparks should be flying . and how . however , beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works . when the other sniper hits , it 's wits vs. wits , cat vs. mouse , gunman vs. gunman . and when the seasoned sniper is caught , it 's up to miller to put politics aside and save him . who needs politics when you a pro like beckett , he took orders from no one but himself , plays by the rules and not the book , and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics . the movie was a direct hit . watch it . rating 4 out of 5 stars .
clint eastwood would star again as the battle-weary detective harry callahan , but would also direct the fourth entry in the 'dirty harry ' series . 'sudden impact ' again like the other additions , brings its own distinguishable style and tone , but if anything it 's probably the most similar to the original in it 's darker and seedy moments ( and bestowing a classic line `` go ahead . make my day '' ) but some of its humor has to been seen to believe . a bulldog named meathead that pisses and farts . oh yeah . however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco . the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes . after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood . he 's ordered to take leave , but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo , where a murder has occurred similar in vein ( bullet to groin and between eyes ) to his case . there he begins to dig up dirt , which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge . to be honest , i was n't all that crash hot on eastwood 's take , but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel 'magnum force ' . this well-assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon ( even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time ) , quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging . it 's like he 's experimenting with noir-thriller touches with character-driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework . his use of images is lasting , due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics . dark tones , brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure ( harry with his new .44 automag handgun ) moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks . it 's a striking sight that builds fear ! mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor . it seemed to come off . a major plus with these films are the dialogues , while i would n't call 'sudden impact ' first-rate , it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines `` you 're a legend in your own mind '' . do n't you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip , before pulling out his piece . the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages . lalo schfrin would return as composer ( after 'the enforcer '' had jerry fielding scoring ) bringing a methodical funky kick , which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get-go . bruce surtees ( an eastwood regular ) gets the job behind the camera ( where he did a piecing job with 'dirty harry ' ) and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes , but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments . eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch , going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan . this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry 's quest for justice by the badge even though he does n't always agree with it . i just found it odd a real change of heart . across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke . her turn of traumatic torment ( being senselessly raped along with her younger sister ) , is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity . when the anger is released , it 's tactically accurate in its outcome . paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j. neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big-mouthed performance . these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps . pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town . in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell ( a regular in the series 1-4 , but under different characters ) . how can you forget him in 'dirty harry' yes he is bank robber that 's at the end of the trademark quote `` do i feel lucky ? well , do ya , punk ? ''
rachel mcadams . cillian murphy . wes craven . the dream team . this is one of the best thrillers of 2005 . a great plot . a great twist . a great eye candy . this is one of wes craven 's greatest movies apart from `` scream '' and `` a nightmare on elm street '' . this could be the best . the plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple . lisa reisert ( mcadams ) a struggling hotel manager , boards a late red eye back to la . little does she know that she has been followed by jackson ripner aka jack the ripper ( murphy ) . they have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane . later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the secreteary of homeland security who is staying in lisa 's hotel . and what does this have to with lisa . well , she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him , if she does n't ripner will murder her father ( brian cox ) . the twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it . overall , definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 . definitely worth the see . 3 1/2 out of 4 stars
this is probably karisma at her best , apart from zubeidaa . nana patekar also gives out his best , without even trying . the story is very good at times but by the end seems to drag , especially when shahrukh comes in the picture . what really made me like it were the performances of the leads , the dialog delivery , as well as the story , for what it was . it could 've been directed better , and edited . the supporting case was even great , including karima 's mother in law , even though she just had one shining moment , it was great to watch her . the sets were also pretty good . i did n't really like their portrayal of a canadian family , but once they step in india , it 's as real as it gets . overall , i would give it a thumbs up !
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores , race relations and desire . granted , it is not a movie for everyone . there are no car chases , no buildings exploding , no murders . the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances , minimal gestures , spatial boundaries , lighting and things left -- sometimes very ostensibly -- unsaid . it 's about identity , memory , community , belonging . the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other , identity , desire , limits and loss . it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer . it will displease those whose palates require explosive , massive , spicy action . it is a beautifully filmed human story . that is all .
the last film in lucas ' saga is a lavish , spectacular-looking production . it is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy , but i think it is a notch above episode iv ( and just a notch below episodes iii and v ) . in fact , i think it is the third best film in the 6-part saga . as far as i 'm concerned , it is still a grandiosely entertaining film . it is not a movie with a beginning , climax and ending ; the film 's mechanism operates with only one goal in its mind : bring closure to lucas ' universe . there is an air of finality attached to the whole thing , which makes the film a little too sentimental , but emotionally rewarding . also , it is a lot of fun . new characters are introduced and old ones face new , unexpected challenges . c3po and r2d2 provide ( as usual ) great comic relief . leia and solo are a wonderful romantic duo , and luke is still a great character to identify with . again , it is luke 's ( and vader 's ) inner conflict what gives the saga its backbone . lucas ' aggressive imagination is still very much apparent , and the film 's themes of loyalty , hope , and redemption resonate strongly . i 'm glad lucas eventually dropped the idea of making episode vii , viii and ix , because this film is a great bookend to a long , fascinating and captivating saga . not a perfect movie , but fun in the best matinée style .
loved the movie . loved the two families crossing paths in history . only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family 's line continue ? he is madame zeroni 's son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children ? hmmmmmmmmm . never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher ? maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit ? even with the mistakes in the movie . just loved it . the acting was great . not sure where the story was with mr. sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier . the other `` counseler '' did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much . poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up .
for a danish movie , i have to say , that this is very good movie . it 's in a class of its own , yet it has an international potential . the movie has a big budget , and is starring famous danish actors , and a few newcomers , who play very well . it can be watched by anyone who like adventures , and a little bit of 'ghost ' movie . do n't be afraid , be thrilled !
in the opinion of several of my friends and family members , including myself , this is the finest of the entire gamut of tarzan movies . johnny weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series . it definitely rates a `` 10 '' in my collection of films .
i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of it.i t is not a mindless movie like ..... '' leathal weapon part 58 '' you know the one where riggs is really crazy ? it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning . you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any way.i have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because ..... duh they do n't get it or understand it or what happened . do n't let your doggy take a shower ! ! !
* i mark where there are spoilers ! overall comments : if you can take a serious movie , go see this . have an open mind and you will enjoy it . do n't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on ! the movie fits together nicely in the second half . i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens . i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago , when will was going around promoting the movie . he was great -- spent a lot of time with the fans . thank you for the picture will ! about will 's performance : a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show , you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance . this is not the case with will smith in this movie . i did n't picture the fresh prince ( lol ) when i was watching this movie . he was completely and utterly convincing in this very , very serious role . he has grown immensely as an actor . i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performance . about his character : ben is very conflicted and tormented . he 's sad ... guilt-ridden ... very determined , but very scared . very true to himself . his character has a lot of depth ... and somehow , will managed to bring that to life . about emily ( rosario ) : rosario did a nice job portraying emily , a woman very much behind on her taxes . maybe she 's not the shining star will is in this movie , but she was very convincing . i think her character just did not have as much to work with as will 's did . about the plot ( no spoilers ) : i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it . i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it , and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so . but when things eventually fit together , wow . surprisingly well written and well thought out . it 's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you . it actually takes a lot out of you to watch . in the theater i was in , most people were crying towards the end -- even grown men . when you realize what ben is doing , and why , it 's a very powerful moment ... * * * * * * * minor spoilers * * * * * which is why it 's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away . i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it . there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed , though . i will mention some of it here ( without trying to give a lot away ) . -the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room . at first , it makes no sense whatsoever . there was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish . -i hated ben at the beginning of the movie . by the end of it , i loved him and hated him . that 's how convincing will was . i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra , a blind man just trying to make his way in the world . why he was treating ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie . wait it out though . everything in this movie : wait it out . -ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wo n't forgive himself for . it 's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt , or if he genuinely wanted to help people . i think it 's a little bit of both ... i think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past . i love his character . you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing . you hate him because of what he is doing to himself ( as a very good person ) , both physically and emotionally . nice job will .
watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release , i am surprised at how well it has held up . one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full hippy glory . seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the heady mix of fervent enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future . the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much flak for the film 's perceived failure . they are ideal and convey perfectly the various contradictions and demonstrate a pure delight in lovemaking . i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes . oh , and i have n't even mentioned the highly explosive ending .
dressed to kill starts off with kate miller ( angie dickinson ) having a sexually explicit nightmare , later on that day she visits her psychiatrist dr. robert elliott ( michael caine ) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage . kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger , they go back to his apartment for casual sex , when done kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman . prostitute liz blake ( nancy allen ) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape . detective marino ( dennis franz ) says he suspects liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so liz teams up with kate 's son peter ( keith gordon ) to track down the real killer , clear liz 's name & see that justice is done ... written & directed by brian de palma i thought dressed to kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery . the script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character 's so you really know them , the entire first twenty minutes is just developing kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off , then the film switches it 's attentions to liz & no one else gets a look in . this way dressed to kill is quite absorbing & engaging , unfortunately the character 's themselves are n't exactly likable . i found some of the dialogue quite funny at times , especially the dirty talk that liz spouts occasionally . the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you 'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill . it 's a good film but it did n't excite me that much & i did n't really find any character to root for or like . the film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that i did n't really see the point of . director de palma directs with style & visual flair , from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it 's impeccably filmed throughout . i 'd imagine that every shot in dressed to kill had a great deal of thought put into it . i felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though , nothing about it really excited me that much . there is a fair bit of nudity , some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence , kate 's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight , if that 's the right word . however , it 's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe . with a supposed budget of about $ 6,500,000 dressed to kill has that glossy high production value feel of a hollywood film . the new york locations are nice , the cinematography is good & as a whole it 's extremely well made . i thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive . the acting is ok but despite his top billing i did n't think caine had that much screen time . allen was married to director de palma at the time dressed to kill was made , interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by de palma in two of them , this & blow out ( 1981 ) , he cast her as a prostitute ... a body double was used for dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start . dressed to kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but i did n't think it quite lived up to it 's lofty reputation . good but not brilliant .
i am the parent of a special needs child and i enjoyed the the movie very much ! it was loving , warm and fun . i learned a long time ago to see the humor in things . i especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died . i attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited . everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions . we talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them . the screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years . she based the character on a real person . our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times . i give the movie two thumbs up ! ! !
when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i 've ever seen , yes it was funny . i mean i liked it all until the end where ........... oh no i ca n't tell u should it for yourself . it is funny except . the vulgar language . that 's why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it , but if not do n't waist ur money on renting it or buying it .
this is definitely one of the greatest disney movies ever made . it 's a real pleaser to anyone . it 'll make you laugh , it 'll make you cry , and it 'll put you into suspense . basically , what homeward bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation . they do n't know what is going on , and desperately wanting to go home , they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness . this is one of the last movies that don ameche starred in . he provided the voice of shadow , the old , wise and friendly golden retriever . also starring in this movie was sally field providing the voice of sassy , the himalayan cat . but seriously , what this movie is all about is chance ! voiced by michael j . fox ( my all-time favorite actor ) , chance is basically all you 'd expect from a dog , lovable , playful , energetic and goofy , and every time i crack up when watching this movie , it 's because of chance ; it 's like the comedy never ends ! this movie is also very sad at times . it sometimes reminds people of the times they 've been alone or when they lose their pets . one scene that always puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound ; i especially feel shocked at the part where chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost does n't make it . the movie had other suspenseful moments , but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one . overall , it 's a wonderful family movie . if you enjoyed this movie , you 'll probably enjoy the sequel too . i give this movie a solid 9 out of 10 !
return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original . it had black humor , good suspense , nice looking girls , and of course , a psycho killer . what are we missing ? i think nothing . except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television . besides being one of the best sequels , it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family . recommended for everyone .
richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman capote 's novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffman 's oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote . they really play well together ( try them on separate nights ) . it is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well . these two truly enhance each other . even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock , the two pieces blend well . only the part of the writer ( played by paul stewart ) in the brooks films is weaker , as they give him a different name then capote . i 'd suggest watching capote first , followed by in cold blood . it makes for a powerful experience !
as a huge baseball fan , my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears . dennis quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher . it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much `` disney '' for my taste .
i truly enjoyed this film . the acting was terrific as was the plot . jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for . the only part of this flick i would change was the ending . the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi channel . there were some interesting religious messages in this film . jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature ( or shark if you prefer ) represented the anti-chirst . there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that 'end of the world feel ' . i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature . i know many people wo n't get the references to christianity , but if you watch close you 'll get it .
this movie is visually stunning . who cares if she can act or not . each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek . the locations , set designs , and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty , youth and wealth . in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek 's story . and ... this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn 's role as father , mentor , lover , and his portrayal of a man , of men , lost to a bygone era when men were men . there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence , containment , and security . yes , they do not make men like that anymore ! but , then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek .
this movie is full of references . like `` mad max ii '' , `` the wild one '' and many others . the ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference ( or tribute ) to peter lorre . this movie is a masterpiece . we´ll talk much more about in the future .
i think this is a lovely family movie . there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie . the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout . danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'the angels ' and is great throughout the film . also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon-levitt and milton davis jr. christopher lloyd is good as al 'the angel ' and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie . a touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy .
i saw heartland when it was first released in 1980 and i have just seen it again . it improves with age . heartland is not just for lovers of `` indie '' films . at a time when most american films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with cgi , pyrotechnics , and/or vulgarity , heartland holds up as a slice of american history . it is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern , urbanized americans are . nothing in this film is overstated or stagey . no one declaims any hollywood movie speeches . the actors really inhabit their roles . this really feels like a `` small '' film but really it is bigger than most multizillion-dollar hollywood productions . the film is based on the lives of real people . in 1910 , elinore randall ( conchata ferrell , who has never done anything better than this ) , a widow with a 7-year-old daughter jerrine ( megan folsom ) , is living in denver but wants more opportunities . she advertises for a position as housekeeper . the ad is answered by clyde stewart ( rip torn , one of our most under-appreciated actors ) , a scots-born rancher , himself a widower , with a homestead outside of burnt fork , wyoming . elinore accepts the position ( seven dollars a week ! ) and moves up to wyoming with her daughter . she and her daughter move into stewart 's tiny house on the property . it is rolling , treeless rangeland , a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals . it 's guaranteed to make a person feel small . the three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul . what is worse , stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent . `` i ca n't talk to the man , '' elinore complains to grandma landauer . `` you 'd better learn before winter , '' replies grandma . grandma ( lilia skala ) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly . she came out to wyoming from germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed . grandma is their nearest neighbor ( and the local midwife ) and still she lives ten miles away ! the other supporting character is jack the hired hand ( barry primus ) . elinore 's routine ( and her employer 's ) is one of endless , backbreaking labor , where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made , fixed or done by hand . this is the real meat of the film : watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land . but despite the constant toil and fatigue , elinore is always looking for other opportunities . she learns that the tract adjacent to stewart 's is unclaimed . impulsively , she files a claim on the property ( twelve dollars , or almost two weeks ' pay ! ) , meaning that if she lives on it ( and she must actually live there ) and works it for ten years , she will get the deed to it . naturally , stewart learns what she has done . with merciless logic , he points out that with no money , no livestock , no credit , and no assets , she has no chance of succeeding . he then offers a solution : he proposes marriage . the stunned elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative , and accepts . we think that stewart 's proposal is purely machiavellian -- -he wants the land and the free labor -- -but we see that , in fact , he is genuinely fond of elinore , and they grow together as a couple . she becomes pregnant ; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard ; clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to grandma 's and the ten miles back , only to announce that grandma was n't there . this is more like real life than is pleasant , folks . elinore has the baby all by herself , with no help whatsoever . their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies . they lose half their livestock to the vicious winter . they struggle on . the last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic : the birth of a calf . clyde calls elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf . instead of being head first , the calf is in a footling breech presentation . he and elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal . there is no cgi , animatronics , trickery , fakery or special effects : what you see is what happened , folks : a calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight . with that , the film does not so much end as simply stop , leaving the viewer unsatisfied , but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole , not just for its ending . this little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness . it will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten .
it holds very true to the original manga of the same name , aka ( tramps like us in the u.s ) but it can still be enjoyed even if you have n't read the manga . it 's a different kind of tail , showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else . however , because of her outward strength , she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let 's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments . the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet ... human ... momo . if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama ( japanese drama ) actors/resses then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read !
dr. mordrid , what can i say ? jeffrey combs has done it again ! anton mordrid has been on earth for 100 years waiting for kabal , an evil sorcerer , to come so he can kill him . mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids , so mordrid knows all kabal 's tricks . the film as a little bit confusing at begin with , but soon you feel a part of the action . i wo n't give away the ending , so go and watch doctor mordrid ! i found the film to be very enjoyable because it does n't have a lot of violence in , nor sexual scenes . the film focused on the plot and that 's what i like ! i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by . this is because you are so engrossed in the film . doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie ! i give it a 20 out of 10 . worth seeing !
i grew up watching , and loving this cartoon every year . i did n't think they would be able to take a half hour ( 20 min ! ) cartoon and make it a movie . they did it . with flying colours ! fabulous , funny , heart warming , effective movie !
kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie , although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version . they 're both good in different ways . kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting , almost , though . and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better , too ... she was more believably sweet and sentimental . there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version , though , like how the humorous side is more apparent .
it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book . in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure . to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left `` deathbed testimony '' which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfying . please understand : while i admire ruth gordon 's performance , her character really , * really * irritates me . she is selfish and demanding . she gets her own way by putting on a simpering 'little girl ' act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age . worse , she has now set herself up as judge , jury and executioner against her dead niece 's husband . when columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies . he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police work . nothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice . abby 's final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well . here is one situation you ca n't squirm out of ms mitchell !
`` cinema is the ultimate pervert art . it does n't give you what you desire ; it tells you how to desire . '' so begins `` the pervert 's guide to cinema , '' in which slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst slavoj zizek applies his freudian/lacanian brain-scalpel to world cinema . this film in three parts is the second feature documentary directed by sophie fiennes ( yes , sister of ralph and joseph ) , and it is a notable accomplishment , clocking in at 2 1/2 hours of talk from one man and yet remaining humorous and engaging throughout . in essence , it is an extended film lecture , and one of the best you may ever get . over the course of the film , zizek guides us through a catalog of obsession and desire in film history . he touches on more than 40 films and , in particular , spends a great deal of time with hitchcock , lynch , chaplin , tarkovsky , the marx brothers , and eisenstein . but he also takes a close look at `` persona , '' `` the conversation , '' `` three colors : blue , '' `` dogville , '' `` fight club , '' and `` the exorcist . '' thematically , zizek 's inquiry into cinema ranges from thoughts on the death drive to the `` coordinates of desire , '' and from gnosticism to `` partial objects . '' `` the pervert 's guide '' will be a slightly better experience if you 've taken a few minutes to bone up on your basic freudian terminology . however , even if you 're not steeped in psychoanalytic theory , zizek 's dynamic and hilarious personality carries the film forward with such gusto that you are n't likely to balk at the specialized lingo . the film frequently cuts from movie clips to images of zizek * inside * the movie he is talking about -- that is , in the original locations and sets . the transitions in these sequences sustain such tension and humor that the trick never gets old . and zizek himself is constantly making us laugh , either from bizarre little jokes or from his enthusiastic insistence on , for example , a bold oedipal interpretation of `` the birds . '' and this go-ahead-and-laugh attitude , on the parts of both fiennes and zizek , is essential to the gonzo character of the film . it is the spoonful of sugar that helps us digest zizek 's weird medicine . after all , do n't we all have a sense that , past a certain point , psychology theorists are just pulling our legs ?
set during wwii , bedknobs and broomsticks is a fun-filled fantasy adventure for kids , starring angela lansbury as an apprentice witch who , with the help of three evacuee children and a 'professor of witchcraft ' , thwarts a nazi invasion . brilliantly inventive , with loads of laughs , this movie will delight kids of all ages with its great characters , exciting story and catchy tunes . lansbury is perfect as eglantine , the not-quite-perfect witch who takes the three children on the adventure of a lifetime , and her three young co-stars ( cindy o'callaghan , roy snart and ian weighill ) are equally impressive as the cockney rascals who aid in battling the nasty hun . the special effects are somewhat dated , but let 's face it , kids do n't care too much about these things , so long as they are entertained . and entertained , they will be . with some impressive scenes which brilliantly mix live action and animation to great effect , and more genuine movie magic than a hundred harry potters , it would be hard not to enjoy this wonderful slice of cinematic escapism . in fact , only a rather drawn-out musical number set in portobello road mars the film 's perfection , but with so much else to enjoy , that can easily be forgiven . and besides , any film featuring uk television legend bruce forsyth as a 'flash ' harry style spiv is guaranteed a good rating from me .
'' ranma ½ '' is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi . the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story , that is not only a comedy , but also an action anime . the main character of the story is ranma saotome , a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts . ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers , who are great friends and trained together during many years . akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo 's : kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what . ranma and akane fight all the time , specially because both have a very bad temper , and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda , many new characters and situations starts to happen . they also discover the reason of the transformation : while fighting , ranma and his father fell in a cursed river . but not only them had this kind of fate ... if you watched `` ranma 1/2 '' and liked , i would recommend you `` inuyasha '' and `` maison ikkoku '' , two other good creations from rumiko 's hands .
chances are , you 'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it . but if , by chance , you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time ( i 'm well into the hundreds by now ) , you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up ! my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends , `` as they say , down with the riots '' .
the sequel to the ever popular cinderella story reminded me somewhat of what they did with one of the beauty & the beast movies . it 's basically three short stories rolled into 1 . ok , the mice are adorable ( i love gus ! he 's sooo cute ! ) , and lucifer 's awesome ( as usual ) . i liked some of the newer characters as well , ( pom pom was adorable and i did like prudence. ) . still , the storyline was somewhat limited , but still very cute . so , i vote 7/10 .
the only other film besides soylent green that has such an air of hopelessness is on the beach . both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms . on the beach with nuclear war and soylent green with the environmental poisoning of the planet . maybe there 's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we have n't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now . new york city still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in soylent green . environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming . for myself it also shows the right to life ethic run amuck . obviously there 's no family planning in this world either . charlton heston is an nypd detective who lives with room mate edward g. robinson who 's old enough to remember the earth before catastrophe struck . there 's been a murder committed , joseph cotten an executive with the soylent corporation , a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product , some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world 's population . it 's latest product is soylent green . the investigation finds charlton heston getting his man , but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the soylent corporation and the future of mankind . as heston shouts in the end that soylent green is made of people , that we 've become a race of cannibals , the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative . we 've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive . this was the farewell performance of edward g. robinson and in his memoirs heston spoke movingly of robinson even though they had differing political views . a few weeks after robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia , he passed away in real life . not many did , but heston knew that robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them . though the timetable was off , it does n't mean that the world envisioned by soylent green may not come to pass . hopefully we 'll have not just the intelligence , but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening .
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly good ! i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had promised . however , after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . with only one 'toilet humour ' gag , over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are hilarious . the staple ingredients of a good film are all there ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film stands tall . sure , you are n't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !
the 63 year reign of queen victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in british history . on the one hand , her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes , and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human . taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the german prince albert was taking forefront , director jean-marc vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes victoria 's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy . it 's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background , and yet that 's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare . taking a very direct and focused approach that centres in on a brief five or so year period between her ascension and marriage to albert , the young victoria does what so little period pieces of this nature offer . instead of attempting a sprawling encapsulation of such a figure 's entire life , vallée instead opts to show one of the lesser known intricacies of victoria 's early years which are easily overlooked in favour of the more publicly known accolades . the result is a feature that may disgruntle historians thanks to its relatively flippant regards to facts and the like , yet never to let document get in the way of extracting a compelling story , writer julian fellowes sticks to his guns and delivers a slightly romanticised yet convincing portrayal . vallée takes this and runs , making sure to fully capitalise on those elements with enough restraint to maintain integrity in regards to both the history involved and the viewer watching . a major part in the joy of watching the young victoria play out however simply lies in the production values granted here that bring early 1800 's regal britain to life with a vigorous realism so rarely achieved quite so strikingly by genre films . everything from the costume designs , sets , hair styles , lighting and photography accentuates the grandiose background inherent to victoria 's story without ever over-encumbering it . indeed , while watching vallée 's interpretation come to life here it is very hard not to be sucked in solely through the aesthetics that permeates the visual element ; and then there 's the film 's score also which works tremendously to further the very elegant yet personal tones that dominate fellowes ' script . entwining the works of schubert and strauss into victoria and albert 's story not only works as a point of reference for the characters to play with , but also melds to the work with an elegance and refrain that echoes composer ilan eshkeri 's original work just as well . yet for all the poignant compositions , lush backdrops and immaculate costumes that punctuate every scene , the single most important factor hereand indeed to most period dramasare the performances of the cast and how they help bring the world they exist in to life . thankfully the young victoria is blessed with an equally immaculate ensemble of thespians both young and old that do a fantastic job of doing just that . between the sweet , budding romance of victoria ( emily blunt ) and albert ( rupert friend ) and the somewhat antagonistic struggles of her advisors and the like ( spearheaded by a terrific mark strong and paul bettany ) , the conflicts and warmth so prevalent to fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved which helps keep the movie from being a plastic `` nice to look at but dim underneath '' affair so common with these outings . in the end , it 's hard to fault a work such as the young victoria . it 's got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance , plus some historical significance that plays as an intriguing source of interest for those in the audience keen on such details . of course , it may not take the cinematic world by storm and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence that stops it from ever becoming more than just a poignantly restrained romantic period drama ; yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable . vallée never seems to be striving for grandeur , nor does he seem content at making a run-of-the-mill escapist piece for aficionados . somewhere within this gray middle-ground lies the young victoria , sure to cater to genre fans and those a little more disillusioned by the usual productions ; beautiful , memorable but most of all , human . - a review by jamie robert ward ( http : //www.invocus.net )
this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end . it has a very humane story and very good selected music . the acting of moritz bleibtreu ( giancarlo amato ) and barnaby metschurat ( gigi amato ) is satisfying . recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie .
absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time . i have seen it at least a hundred times and i ca n't go through it without crying . i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie , or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty . whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal . and for the person who said you ca n't love the movie if you loved the book , wrong ! im a testament to that .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , but it is nothing new . everyone here is grouping it with other war movies , this movie has been miscategorized ! its not a war movie any more than `` one flew over the cuckoos nest '' is a asylum movie or `` cool hand luke '' is a prison movie . this is a movie about individuality , nonconformity , self-confidence and the costs of that personality type . the plot is the same as `` one flew over the cuckoos nest '' and `` cool hand luke '' , its in good company , and it holds its own . its these movies it should be held up against and compared , not `` apocalypse now '' or `` platoon '' . eric
its about time that gunga din is released on dvd . i can not accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but , i never tire of it . the lead actors worked so well together . victor mclaglen ( sgt mcchesney ) , cary grant ( sgt cutter ) and douglas fairbanks jr ( sgt ballentine ) are an unbeatable team . i just can not get over their exploits in india . your first glimpse at the sergeants three , is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map . the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think . they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few `` residents '' in hiding . soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base . later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din . they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters . din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured . soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din , and they are too captured . faced with being killed , they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them . the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush . in doing this , din is shot dead . the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them . at the end , din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army .
i first saw this movie as a pre-teen , about the age when kids start to think through their identity . i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own . the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father ( which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other ) . the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts . the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one , who still prefers her brother . each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions . it 's a great film , even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film .
no doubt intended as a totally campy joke , `` full moon high '' portrays 1950s teenager tony walker ( adam arkin ) accompanying his father ( ed mcmahon ) on a trip to romania . sure enough , tony gets bitten , and grows fur and fangs whenever there 's a full moon . a particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he ca n't age as long as he has the werewolf curse , and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years . but otherwise , the movie 's just plain funny once it gets going . ed mcmahon 's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo ( he thinks that everyone should have listened to joe mccarthy ) , kenneth mars 's coach/principal is a tense dweeb , and then there 's more . one of the most eye-opening cast members is demond wilson - best remembered as lamont on `` sanford and son '' - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise . but probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents ; then gag with gerald ford really summed him up ! anyway , it 's a real treat . considering that alan arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an oscar on sunday night and thanked his sons , i wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie ( aside from adam , his son anthony also has a small role ) . quite funny . also starring elizabeth hartman . ps : director larry cohen is probably best known for the killer baby flick `` it 's alive '' .
i love this movie like no other . another time i will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated , but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue , which , please remember , is all tongue in cheek . aussies and poms will understand , everyone else-well ? ( title song lyric ) '' he can sink a beer , he can pick a queer , in his latest double-breasted bondi gear . '' ( another song lyric ) `` all pommies are bastards , bastards , or worse , and england is the a * * e-hole of the universe . '' ( during a television interview on an `` arty program '' ) : mr mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you 've been in england ? ( barry 's response ) flamin ' bull-artists ! ( while chatting up a naive young pom girl ) : mr mackenzie , i suppose you have hordes of aboriginal servants back in australia ? ( barry 's response ) abos ? i 've never seen an abo in me life . mum does most of the solid yacca ( ie hard work ) round our place . this is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser aussie flick . if you can get a copy of it , watch and enjoy .
it 's one of the best movies i 've seen in the last 2 years ( i 've seen the premier in tel-aviv , israel in the summer of 2006 , exactly when the last war has began ... ) this problem in communication between the people , that causes wars , is interesting me for a long time , and it does n't matter who- boys and girls , straight and gays , jews and arabs ... i 've seen the bubble already 3 times , and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know , and the difference between them , like between tel aviv and jerusalem ... the last time i saw it- was with my friend , who is a christian arab , and it was on the independence day of israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic ) and ... he cried in the end ! ! ! - if he 's been touched and was n't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by the bubble !
what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise , a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films . so ... could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated ? ? ? `` prison '' is the finnish director harlin 's american debut , which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like `` die hard 2 '' , `` cliffhanger '' and `` deep blue sea '' . the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison , re-opened for the cause of over-population in other , more modern state penitentiaries . inside the former execution dungeons , the restless spirit of the electric chair 's last victim still dwells around . the now promoted warden eaton sharpe ( lane smith ) was there already 40 years ago , when this innocent man was put to death , and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial . it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived . viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past . `` prison '' contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it 's the unbearably tense atmosphere that 'll stick to you for certain ! unlike any other horror picture from that decade , `` prison '' features an amazing sense of realism ! by this , i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls , of course , and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed ... even though these are genuinely unsettling as well . the film 's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror . the absolute best terror-moment ( providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age ) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire . haunting ! ! the screenplay only suffers one flaw , but that 's a common one ... almost inevitable , i guess : clichés ! the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding . we 've got the ugly , fat pervert with his 'cute ' boy-toy , the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime ( did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman ? ) do n't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise , as there are so many other elements to admire . the photography is dark and moist , the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class b-actors are excellent ( the fans will recognize tom everett , tom 'tiny ' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder ) . forget about wes craven 's god-awful attempt `` shocker '' or the downright pathetic cheese-flick `` the chair '' . this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down ! especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays ( i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves , hobbits and other fairy creatures ... ) this true 80 's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd-release !
youth , sexuality , and the french countryside -- one of the more unique films you 're ever going to see . if you can see it that is , no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it ( a combination of scarcity and censorship . ) it 's sometimes erotic , sometimes disgusting , and occasionally funny . a trifle boring also in the middle , but all in all you ca n't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you 've seen this one at least once .
it 's a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr . the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome ! the guy is cute too so it 's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls .
this was a very well scripted movie . great fun if you just want a stupid film . not great production value ( ok , the sound really sucked ) but the performance of danny masterson more than makes up for it . watch this movie and laugh out loud !
this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever ! i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish , but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit `` like super cool '' with a `` like totally bitchin '' belt and stick on rhinestones on her face . but anyways , the movie is actually one of the few `` family '' movies that holds your interest . i know that the begining drags , particuarly if you know what is going to happen , but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film . i would n't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie , in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself , but i 'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind .
this was the second of the series of 6 `` classic tarzan '' movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o'sullivan as jane . as usual , this was a wonderful film in this series ; and perhaps stands out as an `` in between '' film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s . as such , it displayed good pace , though not as good as subsequent films . likewise , the cinematography is less accomplished than later tarzan films in this series . the stock i saw was of uneven quality , containing some grainy scenery and some under-exposed and over-exposed scenes . the crisp display of later tarzan films is lacking here . on the other hand , there is one scene , very early on , in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up , showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle , was really almost modern in its style , and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie . regarding plot , one interesting feature here was jane 's near-fickleness and inconstancy , when she was being subject to martin 's flirtations . the kiss  and jane 's stunned , and partly guilty , reaction  foreshadow something of the jane we see in the future as well in these films . compare , for example , in tarzan finds a son ! jane 's duplicitous actions tricking tarzan and delivering boy to his family . later she admits to tarzan that she was wrong . here , nothing quite so explicit , but we have jane `` returning '' to the jane parker of yesteryear , and in an almost repentant series of actions , stripping herself of the evening gown brought by martin and harry to entice her away from tarzan . there were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing . for one thing , the picture we get of the domestic life of tarzan is here , as later , a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death . this to me is very much at the core of the tarzan experience . i was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today 's standards . there were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure : tarzan leading the elephants into the valley of the elephants ' graveyard ; tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo , and then nursed to health by the apes ; cheetah going to find tarzan when jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment ; cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log . the final battle scenes of savages & lions on the ground and savages & apes in the trees . jane , showing us that she is truly of tarzan 's world now , quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away . the final series of scenes is splendid : suddenly tarzan is on the scene , flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions , and summoning the elephants to the rescue ! that final cry of tarzan in triumph , holding a happy jane in his arms , with a dancing and delighted cheetah beside them , is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of tarzan and jane . all in all , this is another wonderful classic tarzan movie . i would recommend this movie strongly to anyone .
this is a very rare film and probably the least known from shirley temple as it is n't on any of her collections.the reason why is probably because it does n't have a happy ending , unlike all her other films.its also not a musical , although she does belt out one song called ' the world owes me a living'.the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white , the version i have is in colour and on vhs , i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic , unlike i would say the colourised films of laurel and hardy which are dreadful.the film is good for its age and the story has n't dated at all , i 'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake.at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out , in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five.although do n't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it , especially when { jerry } gary cooper steals a necklace , and hides it in shirley 's teddy bear.the tension and slow build up to his actions , { while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room } is very well directed.gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good.in all this is a good film from the early 30 's , accept it for its age .
i love cinema so what i 'm about to confess embarrasses me deeply . i had given a thumbs down to `` che , parts 1 and 2 '' without having seen the film . terrible i know . but i felt into a trap perpetrated by ... who ? i do n't really know but there has been a negative word of mouth that spread like wild fire and , no matter how smart i think i am , i fell into it . but , thankfully , i bumped into an argeninean film director , martin donovan , a man i love and admire . when i told him i was n't going to see it because i knew the film was a failure he looked at me as if he was ready to punch me right on the face and donovan is a pacifist ! he took me aside and told me how much he loved the film and why . i went to see both parts straight away and , `` che , part 1 and 2 '' is the best film i 've seen in 2008 . it is , of such purity that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past . the regard for its audience is something that we 're not used to anymore . i do n't know if we ever were . riveting , moving , without concessions and benicio del toro is just extraordinary . we can see his soul , we can actually perceive it . the humanity of the man is overwhelming . so , thank you martin donovan once again for educating me so honestly . bravo del toro , bravo soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark film . do n't commit the mistake i was about to commit . go see it , now , on the big screen
it 's true that danny steinmann 's `` the unseen '' is a simplistic horror thriller with a very predictable plot , no particular attempts for twists or surprises whatsoever and featuring literally every single cliché the genre has brought forward over the decades , but that does n't necessarily make it a bad film . on the contrary , my friends and i were pleasantly surprised by this obscure but nevertheless intense little 80 's shock- feature that mainly benefices from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting . the beautiful and ambitious reporter jennifer fast and two of her equally attractive friends travel to a little californian town to shoot a documentary on the anniversary festival , but their hotel forgot to register their booking . in their search for a place to stay , the trio runs into the exaggeratedly friendly but suspicious museum curator ernest keller who invites the girls to stay at his remote countryside mansion . one by one the girls experience that keller and his extremely introvert and submissive sister victoria hide a dark and murderous secret inside their house . `` the unseen '' can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse amalgamation of the horror classics `` psycho '' and `` the texas chainsaw massacre '' . the plot is a series of familiar themes that became notorious and endlessly imitated due to these two films , like twisted family secrets in the cellar , voyeurism , crazed inbred killers and a very unappetizing treatment of chickens . still , i do n't consider these to be negative remarks , as `` the unseen '' is a completely unpretentious and modestly unsettling thriller that clearly never intended to be the greatest horror classic of the decade . although the denouement of the plot is pretty clear quite fast , director steinmann attempts to maintain the mystery by keeping the evil present in the house `` unseen '' like the title promised . the casting choices and acting performances are truly what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre . sydney lassick , immortalized since his role as the overly anxious psychiatric patient charley cheswick in `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' is truly the ideal choice for the role of ernest keller . his persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed . also stephen furst , who eventually turns from the unseen into the seen , gives away a tremendous performance as `` junior '' . he looks and acts like an authentic handicapped man and his attempts to get close to jennifer in the basement are genuinely unnerving . `` the unseen '' is a slow and predictable but nevertheless potent early 80 's film that will certainly appeal to fans of 70 's exploitation and generally weird stuff .
i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm , happy feeling . i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time ! i thoroughly enjoyed this film . the acting was superb , although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance . bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films . timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance . and billy connolly , as always , totally gorgeous . it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned . such a refreshing experience to see a well-written , superbly acted and good-looking movie .
le grand voyage is a gentle miracle of a film , a work made more profound because of its understated script by writer/director ismaël ferroukhi who allows the natural scenery of this 'road trip ' story and the sophisticated acting of the stars nicolas cazalé and mohamed majd to carry the emotional impact of the film . ferroukhi 's vision is very capably enhanced by the cinematography of katell djian ( a sensitive mixture of travelogue vistas of horizons and tightly photographed duets between characters ) and the musical score by fowzi guerdjou who manages to maintain some beautiful themes throughout the film while paying homage to the many local musical variations from the numerous countries the film surveys . reda ( nicolas cazalé ) lives with his muslim family in southern france , a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to be following the religious direction of his heritage . his elderly father ( mohamed majd ) has decided his time has come to make his hadj to mecca , and being unable to drive , requests the reluctant reda to forsake his personal needs to drive him to his ultimate religious obligation . the two set out in a fragile automobile to travel through france , into italy , and on through bulgaria , croatia , slovenia , and turkey to saudi arabia . along the trip reda pleads with his father to visit some of the interesting sights , but his father remains focused on the purpose of the journey and reda is irritably left to struggle with his father 's demands . on their pilgrimage they encounter an old woman ( ghina ognianova ) who attaches herself to the two men and must eventually be deserted by reda , a turkish man mustapha ( jacky nercessian ) who promises to guide the father/son duo but instead brings about a schism by getting reda drunk in a bar and disappearing , and countless border patrol guards and custom agents who delay their progress for various reasons . tensions between father and son mount : reda can not understand the importance of this pilgrimage so fraught with trials and mishaps , and the father can not comprehend reda 's insensitivity to the father 's religious beliefs and needs . at last they reach mecca where they are surrounded by hoards of pilgrims from all around the world and the sensation of trip 's significance is overwhelming to reda . the manner in which the story comes to a close is touching and rich with meaning . it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age , between son and father , and between defiance and acceptance of religious values . the visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so because it feels as though the camera just 'happens ' to catch the beauty of the many stopping points along the way without the need to enhance them with special effects . nicolas cazalé is a superb actor ( be sure to see his most recent and currently showing film 'the grocer 's son ' ) and it is his carefully nuanced role that brings the magic to this film . another fine film from the film movement , this is a tender story brilliantly told . highly recommended . grady harp
another in the they do n't make em like that category . this story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean , sometimes over-the-top fun . robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings , and they really took the roles and ran with them . malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories , both honors being eminently well-deserved . they counterbalance the somewhat bland leads . neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors , but they 've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here . it 's kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here , but that 's more of a personal bias than anything else . but that does n't take away from the movie 's overall entertainment value , which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable . if you 're up some night and this movie comes on i 'd say watch it . it 's well worth it .
this is n't the best romantic comedy ever made , but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable . it 's directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine . cybill shepherd as corinne is n't bad in her role as the woman who ca n't get over her husband 's death . she has a sexy maturity . but i ca n't say much for ryan o'neal as philip , because he is , at best , nondescript . he may be adequate in the role , but that 's not good enough . however , i get the feeling that some of the characters , particularly alex and miranda , are not written with enough in-depth thought . we do n't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick , and the writers do n't tell us much beyond what happens . but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up , and robert downey jr. is so charming that he melts the screen . even his smile is infectious . and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes . anyway , this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way , why not give it a try .
just after i saw the movie , the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the 'real ' magic in a movie . the combination of the right music , speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body . very special things i saw where the not-knowing effects in the movie , started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an old-story telling fairytale with your grandparents . the magic has returned in me . i rate this movie 8 out of 10 .
i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion , and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect . a love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine . at the beginning of the film , we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children . sean is catholic and sheila is protestant , but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic . there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village . the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school . the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this `` sin '' and soon has sheila 's husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father , the local dairy farmer . in an act of defiance and desperation , sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area . special note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila . she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment . on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community . if fiction , this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama . considering it is true , it changes to a horrific tragedy . in real life , the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there . it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events , and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area , they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers . whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice , crashing planes into buildings , subjugating women , condemning whole races , or just plain on torture and murder , we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society .
before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut `` confessions of a dangerous mind '' , they starred together in this movie . george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer , along with steven soderbergh , which shows that they really believed in this project . in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project , that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as `` ocean 's eleven '' and `` the italian job '' but somehow this movie is only halve successful , or at least it is n't as good as it could had been . the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop . even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters , they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie . the fact that they are being played does n't change much to this , even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying , or anything like that at all . it 's of course due to the writing that the characters are n't used to their full potential . i can only assume that the original italian movie `` i soliti ignoti '' works out much better than this movie does . the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling . nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity . it 's an harmless little caper movie , in which you simply should n't to worry much about the story . in that regard `` welcome to collinwood '' is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well . it 's a movie that you wo n't regret watching once you 've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing . 7/10
a simple comment ... what can i say ... this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over . it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made . with a great cast , jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon , based on his play . it is real to life situation done perfectly . if you have digital cable , one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on . it usually gives this film * * * % stars but in reality it deserves * * * * stars . if you really watch this film , one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now .
wow . what a wonderful film . the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun wei , i hope he has more stories in him . the acting is sublime . renying zhou as doggie was amazing -- very natural talent , and xu zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist . the soundtrack was very effective , guiding without being overwhelming . if only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong kong- a family friendly , well acted , well written , well directed , near perfect gem .
in 1930 , europe received quite a shock when luis bunuel 's ' l'age dor ' was released , causing a riot in paris when screened there , resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years . three years later , in 1933 , when europe had gotten over the shock , it was once again turned on it 's ear with 'ekstase ' , a symphony ( of sorts ) to love . the film starred a young , unknown german actress named hedwig kiesler , who would later change her name to hedy lamarr , when she moved to america to escape the madness of adolf hitler , as eva , a young bride who has just married a cold , distant loveless husband ( played by emil jerman ) , only to discover that she has made a major mistake . one divorce later , eva is footloose & fancy free & is out one day , skinny dipping in a lake , when she discovers adam , a handsome , young engineer ( played by aribert mog ) who takes a real fancy to her ( and she , him ) . after a wild night of passion , eva 's ex-husband turns up once again , hoping to win eva back , only to find he now has a rival . i wo n't spoil what transpires . czech director , gustav machaty ( who directed the original screen version of 'madam x ' , another parable in romantic obsession ) directs from a screenplay by jacques koerpel , frantisek horky & machaty , from the novel by robert horky . the film 's velvety cinematography ( which reminded me of avant garde photographer , man ray 's photos of the era , which goes for some impressionistic use of light & shadow , a lot ) is by hans androschin & jan stallich ) . the film 's brisk editing is by antonin zelenka & the films art direction , which goes for a lush , nearly art deco look , is by bohumil hes ) . if i have any quirk about this film , it is the music score , by giuseppe becce , which goes for an over the top , melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast ( certain themes are repeated over & over again , wearing out it 's welcome , fast -- -kind of like some of david lean 's over use of certain musical themes , especially in 'lawrence of arabia ' , and 'dr.zhivago ' ) . some years back , a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material , cobbled together from various european existing prints available , restoring it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the vatican condemned it as `` decadent '' ( yeah , right ... like the church never did anything wrong ) , and the hayes office cut it to ribbons , when it was finally released in the u.s.a. in 1936 , in a `` hayes office '' approved cut ( likewise ) . minimal dialog in german with english subtitles ( it was meant to be a mainly visual experience ) . not rated , but contains that infamous nude skinny dipping scene by hedy lamarr ( done tastefully , mind you ) & some suggestions of sexual content ( likewise ) that would scarcely earn it a pg-13 rating , nowadays . worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema , or avant garde/experimental cinema
a complex story laid on the background of partition of bharat . an honest muslim who kidnaps an innocent hindu girl , and an educated hindu who burns the harvest of a muslim man - yet in the end you end up liking them both . the story is powerful , yet the screenplay and flow are hesitant . background music score and the songs are outstanding . next comes memorable acting by veteran urmila matondkar . photography captures the time , the violence , and flavor of rural punjab very well . others actors either did not act well , or did not get a chance to act . direction is really the weakest link . the characters were not developed well . not crisp , in contrast to `` the earth '' , where even a 5-line character leaves a mark . the end is very interesting . this story could have several different ending - and all of them could have been equally good .
sequels hardly ever live up to the original . this definitely proves true in this case . however , if you 're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch . although the camera work is lacking , brian krause 's character is annoying , and the plot is clique , it 's much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it . do n't see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film . quite frankly it 's a bit different . rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays , stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project , cabin by the lake . this movie has a much different feel but it 's still great to see stanley back in action . i 'm giving it a 6 out of 10 .
this musical is decidedly mixed , and none of the elements really fit together , but it somehow manages to be mostly enjoyable . the plot contains some of the elements of wodehouse 's novel , but none of its virtues , though he co-wrote the script . the songs , though charming , have nothing to do with this particular film , and are unusually crudely squeezed into the plot , even by pre-oklahoma standards . burns and allen do their usual shtick quite competently , but it misses the tone of the rest of the film by about forty iq points . there are a few high points . reginald gardiner does good work when he remembers that this is a talkie , and stops mugging like a silent actor . and there are a few bits of writing which could only have been written by wodehouse , though most of the film feels like the production of one of the hollywood meetings he later parodied .
robert siodmak does a fabulous job with this b noir starring ella raines , franchot tone , and alan curtis . and he does it , i might add , without a lot of help from his male actors , i.e. , curtis and tone . it 's raines all the way , a pretty , leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her `` noir '' counterparts . siodmak 's use of sex , light , shadows , and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre . the shadows , lighting effects , and camera angles are all effective . but the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by elisha cook , egged on by an excited raines . it 's this scene that brings `` phantom lady '' into new territory . siodmak 's commitment to the material is matched only by raines , who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man . franchot tone phoned this one in . alan curtis did n't seem upset that he might die and did n't seem happy that he lived . and he never , except for a brief moment in prison , seemed to be in love with raines . the amusing thing about many of these films is that , as world war ii progressed , interest in psychiatry deepened . but often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as `` possessed , '' `` spellbound , '' and `` the greatest show on earth . '' tone is called paranoid by thomas gomez - tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder , but he appears to be closer to a psychopath . in actuality , as evidenced by his headaches , he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain . phantom lady does n't have the greatest plot , but it 's well worth watching .
this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events . unfortunately not everything in life , including religion , are all nice and rosy . sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective do not look as great as they once did . `` a love divided '' tells the story of a family , yes it does incorporate religion , but really the story is about a family , and that family 's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them . this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story , scene by scene , is true , but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family . both churches are at fault here , the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight . in this case both let this family down . i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family . it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church , just the opposite , it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion 's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves .
`` footlight parade '' is fascinating on so many levels . there is no way the supposedly staged `` theater prologues '' could have been produced in any theater on earth , of course . think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for `` by a waterfall , '' for instance . ( berkeley directed john garfield in `` they made me a criminal '' six years later and had the dead end kids singing `` by a waterfall '' as they took their showers . ) `` shanghai lil '' is the best production number in the picture . it 's a catalog of '30s warner bros. sensibilities . note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes . you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house . here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others . i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a `` card section '' presentation of roosevelt 's image . there 's also the nra eagle -- the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal . fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he 'd pull the nation out of the depression . you 'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm , of course . warner bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f.d.r . administration . dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker , `` lil . '' she hardly even watches her feet as she dances , which was one of her signature flaws . the pre-code stuff is fun . the `` by a waterfall '' number is wonderful in that regard . the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on . the spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years . in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures .
really , i liked it . the premise was good , the story fit where both respective series left off , and here 's my favorite part . mary and valerie are n't bitter ! they are n't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it , or do possible reunions ( a prime example is susan dey , `` the partridge family '' ) . in fact , valerie was saying that she 'd be thrilled to do another movie , and then mary said the same thing later , so i would be on the look for another ... but if that does n't quite work out , then they can re-run this one .
it was simple and yet so nice . i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society , which can be bitter , was shown very delicately . it had a bitter kind of hummer in it . the fact that most of the actors were not professionals , made the movie more tangible and more realistic . there was a `` documentary '' side to the movie too . the best scenes were those that all the girls , banned from watching , were listening passionately to the soldier , who is supposed to keep an eye on them , broadcasting the game . if you are an iranian , the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won , fills you up with national pride ! ! if you are not iranian , you 'll still love it all the same !
this is a great film - esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of today 's politically-minded filmmakers . a film that can so easily combine sex , gender relations , politics and art is a rarity these days . while the bouyant optimism of the 1960 's ca n't be regained , i think we can at least learn a lesson from the film 's breezy energy and charm . i do n't know what those who label the film `` boring '' were watching - there 's so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time .
i do n't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them worthless . what about just being entertained ? something at which morgan freeman excels . he gets a chance to show off a bit . paz vega , his co-star , gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his movie . i thought it was a good movie . some humor , some pathos , some bittersweetness but nothing over the top . i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company . when he looks at freeman adoringly and says , `` you make me want to be a woman . '' he 's just hilarious . the fight scene between ms. vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful too . in short , it 's a cute , charming film that will make you smile . you could do much , much worse .
`` hollywood hotel '' has relationships to many films like `` ella cinders '' and `` merton of the movies '' about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood , only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non-existent . in fact , as i was watching it tonight , on turner classic movies , i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic `` singing in the rain '' may have taken some of their ideas from `` hollywood hotel '' , most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen . `` hollywood hotel '' is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s . among the supporting players is louella parsons , playing herself ( and , despite some negative comments i 've seen , she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines ) . she is not the only real person in the script . make-up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another . this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr. ronald reagan , playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere . reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people . dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest , and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman 's band . the beginning of this film , by the way , is quite impressive , as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell . they end up singing `` hooray for hollywood '' . the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose . throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make-up king , rin tin tin , and even a hint of tarzan . but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power . obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox , and the name donald duck was substituted . in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman 's orchestra at their best . so did a later five minute section of the film , where the band is rehearsing . powell leaves the band and his girl friend ( frances langford ) and goes to hollywood , only to find he is a contract player ( most likely for musicals involving saxophonists ) . he is met by allen joslyn , the publicist of the studio ( the owner is grant mitchell ) . joslyn is not a bad fellow , but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them . he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel , which is also where the studio 's temperamental star ( lola lane ) lives with her father ( hugh herbert ) , her sister ( mabel todd ) , and her sensible if cynical assistant ( glenda farrell ) . lane is like jean hagen in `` singing in the rain '' , except her speaking voice is good . her version of `` dan lockwood '' is one `` alexander dupre '' ( alan mowbray , scene stealing with ease several times ) . the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was , and lane ( when not wrapped up in her ego ) is fully aware of it . having a fit on being by-passed for an out-of-the ordinary role she wanted , she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film . joslyn finds a double for her ( lola 's real life sister rosemary lane ) , and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow-up party . but she attends with powell ( joslyn wanting someone who does n't know the real lola ) . this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself . but otherwise the evening is a success , and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive . the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face , after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell ( `` and his gang of hoodlums '' ) . powell 's contract is bought out . working with photographer turned agent ted healey ( actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point ) , the two try to find work , ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy ( the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto ) . eventually powell gets a `` break '' by being hired to be dupre 's singing voice in a rip-off of `` gone with the wind '' . this leads to the final section of the film , when rosemary lane , herbert , and healey help give powell his chance to show it 's his voice , not mowbrays . it 's quite a cute and appealing film even now . the worst aspects are due to it 's time . several jokes concerning african-americans are no longer tolerable ( while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood , healey accidentally photographs a porter , and mentions to joslyn to watch out , powell photographs too darkly - get the point ? ) . also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane , who is ( shall we say ) too high strung is not very tolerable either . herbert 's `` hoo-hoo '' ing is a bit much ( too much of the time ) but it was really popular in 1937 . and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere ( this was one of his last films ) reminds people of the tragic , still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937 . but most of the film is quite good , and wo n't disappoint the viewer in 2008 .
most people , when they think of expressionist cinema , look to the b & w german films of the silent and early sound eras -- films that emphasized canted angles , extreme contrasts of light and dark , exaggerated performance , and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional , naturalistic modes of cinematic representation . if we 're willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema ( and that those above-mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film ) , then i would argue that dodes'ka-den ( dkd ) is a prime example of this type of film . like dreams , dkd is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film , dabbling , as it does , in the unreal . however , dkd is also , unlike dreams , a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture . why ? mostly , i think , it 's the colors . this was , i believe , kurosawa 's first color film , and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors , creating a completely unreal contemporary japan . we are used to the neon lights and gleaming tokyo skyscrapers ; we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons . dkd is , as i said , a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard , appearing to live in an alternate universe . that is , i think , the point -- these are the tokyo outsiders , the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii . the film also represents one of kurosawa 's more heartfelt movies ; there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos ( such as when the boy 's father describes their dream home ) . it 's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning , john ford-like vistas and samurais . everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this ( ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways ) . i will also argue , to the last , that this is kurosawa 's greatest achievement . his samurai films , though capable pictures , pale in comparison to works by kobayashi ( hara-kiri is the greatest , most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid ) . rashomon , hidden fortress , seven samurai , yojimbo , sanjuro , kagemusha , and ran are all fine films , but they 're merely good ( and , frankly , i think that word is too generous for hidden fortress and kagemusha ) . dkd is a great movie , as is ikiru . they are the crown jewels that show akira was not a one-trick samurai pony . they reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema .
this is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing . the photography is simply outstanding . the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples , leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car , is incredible . the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film .
tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen , and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket , a film of similar nature . bozz is played exceptionally well by farrell , and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends . the ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave . what a film .
luckily , not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv . and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending ! but i 'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie . there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots , but also very chilling and even daring moments . considering the production year 1969 , the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows . of course now it does n't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done . and it 's not just because of the two george 's actresses . the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly , no wonder , and it certainly did hit me . very effective . also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action . this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side , but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad . well , being a case of war , mostly bad . for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must . his work is always excellent , touching but never over the top . and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall . talk about fräulein ! let 's hope they get this on dvd soon , so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem .
ten years after the first movie , james belushi , one of the most gifted , and over looked light comedic actors of the last twenty years , returns as detective dooley for this movie . if you are expecting more of the same from the first movie , you will be disappointed , but this is still a good movie . realizing that all the dog vs. man battle of wills scenarios had probably been used up in the first movie , this one turns slightly more psychological in its approach as it concentrates on a criminal with a fixation with dooley 's recently deceased wife after she rejected his book , and blames dooley for her death . the script may not be the best , but the movie allows both belushi and christine tucci to show their good acting ability , while still retaining enough of the light humour of the first movie to make it work , and the chemistry between the two stars is there for all to see . an easy , light going movie , which , while maybe not worth a purchase unless you are a true fan of either the first movie or belushi , definately worth a watch when it comes on tv .
on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened , but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear . i enjoyed this movie . dean cain was excellent in the role of bob . lexa doig 's character was confusing to understand , at first , she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart . dean cain 's performance was an usual excellent . he gets better with every film he does . my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob , camilla and the baby . it was left for the viewer to decide
a compelling , honest , daring , and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - `` descent '' is a film that went under-the-radar due to its lack of distribution because , frankly , the film is so brutal in its depictions , that if it had been released theatrically , it may have met itself to some strong biased hate . the film deserves to be discovered for , not only its dark themes , and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but most of all for its performances . chad faust is absolutely stunning , bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one , not relate to , but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes , but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self . it 's a supporting performance that is so complex , brave , and emotional on faust 's part . and hard to forget . however , the standout is rosario dawson , whose performance here is an absolute revelation . a tour-de-force of realistic dramatic tics , and one of the most subtle , yet loud-as-can-be performances in quite some time . while dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great-to-bad films , she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances , believably and thematically . one of the best films of its year ( and 2007 was a strong one ) - had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release , i would be screaming praises for it , as well as dawson and faust . too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal . films like this deserve better !
this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - it was meant to be a parody of teen-horror-devil-worship movies ( and the '80s saw plenty of them ) ! i saw this movie when it first came out , and instantly liked it . being a big fan of kiss , it was great to see gene in the movie . and anything with ozzy as a metal-hating preacher ca n't be all bad ! also , fastway was already a favorite of mine , so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack . the original vhs ( this was pre-dvd ) cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling , playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a `` demon '' looking on . it was a special order , and the price for the vhs copy at the time ( circa 1987 ) was $ 90 ! i really wanted the movie , but not at that ridiculous price . the 'ozzy-gene ' cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release . the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie , so they had better put 'em on the cover ! same thing with the original `` little shop of horrors '' - jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes , but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star . i have a `` trick or treat '' web site , and it 's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person ! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr ' . all-in-all , it was just a good time , rock-n-roll movie . definitely not to be taken too seriously , but just enjoyed !
often tagged as a comedy , the man in the white suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there . sidney stratton is an eccentric inventor who is n't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice , he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were . after bluffing his way into birnley 's textile mill , he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out , but also never needs to be cleaned ! . he is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him , but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary . yes the film is very funny , in fact some scenes are dam hilarious , but it 's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me . the contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here , do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ? , you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in britain to know what i 'm on about . the decade the film was made is a crucial point to note , the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay , science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions . you watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist stanley , from hero to enemy in one foul swoop , a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind ! , it 's so dark the film should of been called the man in the black suit . i honestly ca n't find anything wrong in this film , the script from roger macdougall , john dighton , and director alex mackendrick could be filmed today and it would n't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has . the sound and setting is tremendous , the direction is seamless , with the tonal shift adroitly handled by mackendrick . some of the scenes are just wonderful , one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch 's elephant man some 29 years later , and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley , but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world . a timeless masterpiece , thematically and as a piece of art , 10/10 .
* * * spoilers * * * all too , in real life as well as in the movies , familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun , or rifle , in their hands . the case of young and innocent , in never handling or firing a gun , jimmy davis , franchot tone , has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men , like jimmy davis , are forced to take up arms for their country . jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay , by being belted in the mouth , by his good friend fred p. willis , spencer tracy , ended up on the front lines in france . with jimmy 's unit pinned down by a german machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple . it was when jimmy gunned down the last surviving german , who raised his arms in surrender , that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him . recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army volunteer nurse rose duffy , gladys george . rose was really in love with jimmy 's good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her . it 's when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose , thinking that he was killed , fell in love and later married jimmy . when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy , now fully recovered from his wounds , was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and rose who had already accepted jimmy 's proposal of marriage to her ! with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred , who 's still in love with her , a bitter and resentful young man . it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front . smug and sure of himself , and his ability to shoot a gun , jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city 's underworld ! not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster . jimmy 's life of crime came full circle when rose , after she found out about his secret life , ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a `` valentine day '' like massacre , with his gang members dressed as cops , of his rival mobsters . while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then , after his three year sentence is up , get his life back together . * * * spoiler alert * * * hearing rumors from fellow convicts that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law . it 's at fred 's circus , where he works as both manger and barker , that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he , like at his trial , had a sudden change of heart . but the thought of going back to prison , with at least another ten years added on to his sentence , was just too much for jimmy ! it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job , that he himself did n't have the heart to do , for him !
this show is a great history story . it 's has everything from slavery , the way they were treated , religion , the ways jews were sent into hiding , the inquisition , the belief in the orisha the african gods , the way women were treated , including the daughters . even down to homosexuality . the way the characters are intertwined and that violante , that character saddens me . she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.i am so glad they decided to re-release it to t.v . again . although i would love to see the unedited version . xica has become my heroine . i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it . i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century . i look forward to my xica every night . it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too .
i first saw enchanted april about five years ago . i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas . it 's about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april , leaving their humdrum lives behind them . they are very sad women at the outset of the film , and you ca n't help but root them on as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses . this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen . it ' pure and simple , with no car chases , no animosities and no deaths . it was made with care and in very good taste . you can not help but smile all through it -- except when you 're crying happy tears !
really good horror flick featuring to of the greatest , boris karloff and bela lugosi . dr. janos rukh ( karloff ) is on an expedition in africa trying to find an ancient meteorite . after finding it , rukh is poisoned by the its radiation . all he touches dies and the dark side of rukh makes him become an egotistic murderer . his friend , dr. felix benet ( lugosi ) finds a limited remedy to the problem and at the same time realizes the radiation could be used for the good of mankind by curing diseases . the two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities . pretty good special effects . others in the cast : frances drake , frank lawton , beulah bondi and frank reicher .
what keeps us going - or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed . without spoiling so much , of course there is a red herring and a twist . but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud 's imperfections and his difficulty in coping . when there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick , perverted pedophiliac that we 're predisposed to have in mind . one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof . these problems of course are given their denouement in the film 's shocking finale . this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear . they were heckling obviously because they are n't partial to `` central location '' films . although there is a bit of travelling , when we get to the woods and the beach . and we realize that gallien is n't as clever as we are made to think he is . the inquisitor is 5/5
if ever anyone queries whether cinema is an art form , you can do worse than pointing them at this movie . quite simply it is the perfect combination of story , script , actors and cinematography ever committed to celluloid . the story of a doomed bomber pilot who is missed by his heavenly conductor in the english fog during the second world war , and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities ( or is it in his head ) is played with panache by david niven and kim hunter and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the doomed pilot ( niven ) describes his plight to the ground radio operator ( hunter ) . the sense of otherworldliness is heightened by jack cardiff 's photography and the incredible production designs . the supreme touches extend to the heaven shots appearing in black and white and earthbound scenes presented in technicolour - this is even mentioned by the celestial conductor ( a fantastic marius goring ) . not only a highpoint in british cinema , but a highpoint in cinema , period .
this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw ... i was about 5 at the time . it scared me good ! but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mom got very upset . she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint ! now that 's a movie ! hey for it 's time it was a great movie . that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then . and if your 5 it is very scary ! kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination . your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects ! ( imo )
i have yet to see a film with nolte in it that i did not like . however , this being said , he 's made a lot of films and i 've seen just a few . in my minds eye i am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in `` the thin red line '' . nolte has a a full range of acting talents . when it 's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion . his best moments are the ones i treasure in actors : when he just emotes through facial , hand and body gestures , without saying anything . having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors , by and large , have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking , having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of keaton and chaplin , this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers . of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in . had chaplin lived in our times .... who knows , he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools . i have not read the vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen . however , the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we can not follow the path laid , even with all its surprises . of course on the outset it appears preposterous . however , it is also not impossible . consider these for starters : a spy at the heart of the third reich : he extraordinary life of fritz kolbe , america 's most important spy in world war ii by delattre and prichard ( look at amazon for more details ) . consider : history undercover : piercing the reich : american spies inside nazi germany dvd ( i saw this here : http : //store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml ? id=75054 ) seems to be a history channel production . so , is the story ridiculous ? far fetched yes , impossible , no . back to the plot . nolte 's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts . was it a type of passivity , that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part ? that 's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp . but , it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things . the acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out alan arkin , always fantastic , is very good in a small role . i was really shocked by the ending of the film ( no - i wo n't spoil it ) and it made me feel terrible about the choice . did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages ? hard to say but it really jolts . nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect .... the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things . it 's very entertaining and provoking . what great movies should be . a bit long but worth it . by the way , the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers : arvo part .
successful self-made married businessman harry mitchell ( a superbly steely performance by roy scheider ) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper cini ( the gorgeous kelly preston ) . harry 's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods -- sleazy porno theater manager raimy ( a splendidly slimy john glover ) , antsy strip joint owner leo ( well played by robert trebor ) and crazed pimp bobby shy ( a frightfully intense clarence williams iii ) -- who have videotaped his affair with cini . when harry refuses to pay up , the hoods kill cini and make it look like harry did it . this in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between harry and the hoods . director john frankenheimer , adopting a tough script based on elmore leonard 's gritty crime thriller novel , expertly maintains a steady snappy pace , delivers plenty of gripping tension , and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere . the leads are all uniformly excellent , with stand-out supporting turns by ann-margret as harry 's bitter neglected wife barbara , vanity as brash jaded prostitute doreen , and lonny chapman as harry 's loyal business partner jim o'boyle . the tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout . the wickedly profane dialogue , jost vacano 's glossy cinematography , gary chang 's stirring score , the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well . as an added bonus , both vanity and preston take their clothes off . a very strong and satisfying little number that 's well worth checking out .
before the devil knows you 're dead starts off promisingly , setting up a simple heist that goes awry , told from varying perspectives ( in rashomon style ) . at around the hour mark , sidney lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts ; it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama , exploring the full realm of human emotions/relations , as the story comes to its chilling climax . as is the case with lumet , he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast , without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole . philip seymour hoffman , in one of his best roles , is a complex , mysterious , and interesting character , and oftentimes dwarfs ethan hawke , who plays his brother , hank . that 's not to say that hawke is not bad ; in fact he is quite above adequate , in a troubled role that suits his style . marisa tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance ( the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this ) . albert finney 's character ( andy and hank 's father ) is the most intriguing , and in my opinion , he deserved a bit more screen-time . amy ryan also performs her job adequately . before the devil knows you 're dead is not an exceptional movie , but it proves that lumet is still near the top of his game at the ( apparent ) twilight of an illustrious career . many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here , not least of which involves the use of his characters . infused with a killer script ( no pun intended ) , smart dialogue and pacing , and a decent score , before the devil knows you 're dead is a must-see . a truly underrated gem . 8/10 . 3 stars ( out of 4 ) . should just enter my top 250 at 248 . highly recommended .
i watched the mccoys reunion and was glad to see richard crenna and kathleen nolan and tony martinez ! ! ! to see them now was wonderful , because i always watched the show growing up so when the tv said that there was going to be a reunion i was so excited ! ! ! ! the only thing i could not figure out is why lydia reed ( hassie mccoy ) and michael winkelman ( little luke ) was not on there.i know that walter brennan had died . so i got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to lydia reed ( hassie mccoy ) and michael winkelman ( little luke i would be thankful ! ! ! i have searched everywere and no luck .the only thing i could find out about michael winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 . this show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learned.the shows today dont have that.the whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them so since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do ! ! ! thank you glenda
it 's about an embezzler , peter ustinov , who infiltrates a british company , texa-conn or something like that , posing as a computer whiz and security expert . he secretly learns to hack into the computer , while gathering the admiration of his boss , karl malden , the enmity of his office rival , bob newhart , and the love of his inept secretary , maggie smith . some of the business details were a little murky to these non-business-oriented eyes but they 're believable enough and i got the general idea . ustinov , the peculating peter , establishes phony businesses in paris , rome , and stuttgart , and uses texa-conn 's computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz establishments . the overseas companies , of course , consist of nothing more than himself , ustinov , and the addresses are an abandoned artist 's loft in paris , a barber shop in rome , and a bakery in germany . he simply visits them to collect the checks he 's sent himself . i did n't think i 'd like it for the first few minutes because it seemed rather on the slow side . i was expecting something with a faster tempo and more outrage , along the lines of `` the pink panther '' or `` the lavender hill gang . '' but this film insinuates itself into your good graces as you come to appreciate the understated humor in the plot , the characterizations , and the dialog . probably it would be a bad idea to give away too many of the relatively subtle gags but here are some examples of the more noticeable . ustinov to secretary smith : `` let me have the assets of these companies . '' smith : `` assets ? what are they ? '' ustinov : `` little female donkeys . '' now , nothing is made of this little exchange . there 's a quick cut and no delay for any laughter , which is appropriate because one 's reaction is more likely to be a smile than a laugh . ustinov searches out that crummy loft in paris . it 's covered with cobwebs . bricks are strewn around and a couple of the former occupant 's paintings have been left behind . the landlord does n't speak english and ustinov knows no french . ustinov points to a child-like painting of a nude woman and chuckles , `` ah . a fam fye-tal , eh ? '' landlord chuckles too , replies : `` vous le prenez pour une anee ? '' ustinov : `` oh -- annie , so that 's her name ! '' landlord : `` oui ? '' ustinov : `` entente cordiale ! '' ( mes amis , if i got those genders wrong , je m'excuse . ) bob newhart as willard gnatpole ( ! ) has the hots for maggie smith and is supposed to be driving her home but tells her he 's taking `` the scenic route . '' there is an immediate sequence of suggestive traffic signs . `` caution . '' `` lay-by . '' `` give way . '' `` yield . '' ending with the imperious `` stop/children . '' there 's another montage when ustinov 's scheme is about to be discovered by the board of directors -- blurry rooftops , police cars , a farewell embrace from maggie , ending with a sign : prison , wormwood scrubs . well , maybe one more . i still ca n't get over malden as the boss , declaring decisively , `` i never agonize over decisions , '' then gulping a handful of pills and washing them down with a glass of water . the acting is unarguably fine . it 's bob newhart 's best role , for instance . not that he had that many , and not that his range was n't limited , but he 's perfect in this part . the musical score by laurie johnson obviously had a good deal of effort put into it . she seems to have written a brief concerto for flute . ustinov 's passion is music and his overseas establishments are headed by false names like claude debussy and giacconino rossini . stuttgart 's phony president is somebody named schmidt , and he 's an anomalous clinker . maggi smith is pretty , sexy , bourgeois , and turns out to be not nearly so dumb as she seems . delightful , in its own quiet way , but do n't expect comic fireworks .
a message movie , but a rather good one . outstanding cast , top to bottom . interesting in that bette davis 's plot line is essentially back story ! the extremely negative reviews ( name throwing at the screenplay/playwright , associating this somehow with extremely negative comments about 'angles in america ' , etc . etc . ) object to the movie being too preachy about germany in wwii . gosh , that is just a bit too sophisticated an understanding of morality for me . theatrical and movie-making , and acting styles vary over time and of course 70 years later this particular movie would not be made in this way . yes casablanca is a better movie ( i guess ) , but although made in the same year and both having nazis in them , casablanca is primarily a love story . the love story in this movie takes second seat to the spy plot -- more of a thriller . both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors . the children are a bit tedious and could have been edited
it is very hard to rate this film . as entertainment value for 21st century viewers , it fails miserably . however , for the student of early sound films and history , it is a jewel . `` show of shows '' was a revue filmed to compete with mgm 's successful `` hollywood revue of 1929 '' , which still survives intact complete with its technicolor scenes . the purpose of the all-star revue was to showcase a particular studio 's silent stars in speaking roles , and show that they could make the transition . however , warner bros. seems to have forgotten this and employs many acts and stars that they did n't even have under long-term contract such as ben turpin , lloyd hamilton , beatrice lillie , and even a marching band . meanwhile , their biggest talent - al jolson - is noticeably absent . even at a high salary he could not be compelled to join in . almost every act is overly long and the film plays like a dozen or so vitaphone shorts strung together with no continuity . the finale is also overly long , but it is really enjoyable with all of its dance numbers . the highlights of the film are two numbers from winnie lightner - `` pingo pongo '' and `` singin in the bathtub '' , a couple of numbers with nick lucas , john barrymore performing shakespeare , and the chinese fantasy `` li po li '' with nick lucas and myrna loy . this last number is the only part of the film that survives in technicolor , and it really is quite attractive . reasonably enough , the players in these good acts were long-term warner bros. stars so perhaps the director knew how to play to their strengths since he was familiar with them . this film acts as a snapshot at an odd point in film history - the year 1929 , which was the bridge year between two eras - the silent and sound eras , and the roaring 20 's and the great depression . just two years later this same film would have had an entirely different cast , as warner bros. would abandon its silent era stars and the stars they hired just to produce the early musicals in favor of those stars that gave warner bros. its distinctive urban look and feel - james cagney , joan blondell , edward g. robinson , and others .
robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan , new york . he covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known . i would like to see much more of this show . it is very entertaining . mr. wuhl uses examples and `` show and tell '' to get his points across . he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere ! henry wadsworth longfellow used revere 's name because it sounded better . i 've watched robert wuhl for many years , from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through `` arli $ $ '' on hbo . he 's a good actor and a good stand-up comedian , but he 's an excellent teacher ! i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show . it is well worth your time .
this is the best of shelley duvall 's high-quality `` faerie tale theatre '' series . the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief , and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood . jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella , especially in the garden scene with matthew broderick 's prince charming . jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well , although i 'm not sure i liked the `` southern lady '' characterization with some of the lines . steve martin 's comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin , but a tiny bit misplaced in the show 's flow . as is customary with the series , there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ( ages 15 and up ) . with a couple of small bumps , the show flows well , and they live happily ever after . children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much .
the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv ( ch . 5 ) during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s , mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve . it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through , being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle . the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer . not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time . definitely not a rankin-bass production .
brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren . best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen , and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . the corn on face is a classic , as good as anything in blazing saddles . the take on lawyers is also superb . after being accused of being a turncoat , selling out his boss , and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently `` i 'm a lawyer '' he says . three funny words . jeffrey tambor , a favorite from the later larry sanders show , is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . his character is more malevolent than usual . the hospital scene , and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site , are all-time classics . look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting ( one bleeds ) . this movie gets better each time i see it ( which is quite often ) .
no awards show can please all the people . clearly if your favorite movies did n't win , you will say the show was n't very good . that 's understandable . however , the 74th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history : woody allen 's first appearance ever at the academy awards . allen has often shunned the awards as being self-aggrandizing and pointless , and has never attended -- even though he has won several of the coveted awards . when the 74th academy awards were held , the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york . when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york , they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . then the announcer simply said : `` ladies and gentleman , oscar award winning director woody allen . '' the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene . as the applause died down , woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation . some highlights : `` thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search . '' `` i thought they wanted their oscars back , '' he joked . `` i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything. `` `` but that was n't it . i could n't work it out because my movie was n't nominated for anything this year . then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise . '' allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar-aversion for this one special night . `` for new york city , i 'd do anything . so i got my tux on and came down here , '' said allen . `` it 's a great , great movie town . it 's been a great , moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great , great city . ''
i was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue , but was pleased to find a fast-paced script , an underlying moral , excellent portrayals from all the actors , especially peter finch , amazing special effects , suspense , and beautiful cinematography -- there 's even a shot of the majestic stone buddhas recently destroyed by the taliban . not to mention elizabeth taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic , before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work . all the supporting players round it out , and i do wonder who trained all those elephants . speaking of the stone-buddha sequence , you really can discern that it 's vivien leigh in the long shots . her shape and the way she moves is distinct from taylor 's . the only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots , where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk . if you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring , spend a few hours with elephant walk .
i was not really a big fan of star trek until past 2-3 years . thanks to the advent of netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution , i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes . for those that do n't really watch every single episode and know them by heart , through tng , ds9 , voyager , etc. , general popular consensus will say -- `` i like the next generation '' the best . that 's because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation . but to be quiet honest , i appreciate the creativity of voyager 's episodes more than tng . voyager 's episodes also progresses through time unlike tng . granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager 's doctor -- now that 's creativity ! instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky , give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined . not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive , self growth , as a doctor , self realization now that is science fiction at its best ! endgame portray him as a husband married to an `` organic '' , inventing neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface , and even -- in the episode before endgame , to disobey captain 's order and make `` human '' mistakes . unlike ds9 which are blessed with 2 beautiful women right from 1st episode , voyager has to survive 3 seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality . of course the rest of the voyager 's cast chemistry just flows effortless , harry kim and tom paris -- very natural . i love tuvoc occasional humor , despite being a vulcan . finally , i 'm so glad they got rid of that original female captain -- oh , if you get to watch the rare footage -- thank god for kate ! she has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident , believable , and respectable female captain . what a great job ! thank you star trek for making voyager , i enjoy every episode , the creative exploration of possibilities , of morals , and of our cosmic expanse .
at the start , this one is from england , so , of course , i had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema . i never heard of this film before . from the minute i saw helena bonham-carter , i said to myself : oh ! here 's comes the feminine version of my left foot . i was right , but i was also wrong . wrong because the two movies are very differents . my left foot was a john ford alike movie and this one is a chaplin alike movie ( not because this is funny , but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes . ) i was right because in 1990 handsome daniel day-lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality . here , very beautiful bonham-carter did exactly the same thing , but with very feminine emotions . the story is well written and it 's very intelligent . for me , miss bonham-carter gives one of the greatest woman 's part of the 1990 's , with emily lloyd in breaking the waves . gee ! and look at her eyes ! she had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since jobyna ralston , louise brooks , michele morgan and ava gardner ! she 's also a true talent , as seen on many other movies . see this one , you wo n't regret it ! and a very fine job by branagh too !
i 'm giving it only 9 out of 10 , because i need to view it again , in a more current mind-frame to have a fresh perspective . what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it . i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day ( probably 1990 or so ) . i might have even recorded it , but that recording is long gone , i 'm sure . i wrote to greencine to try and get this title in , they currently do n't carry it . i hope i can find it at a local video store . i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere . it 's interesting at the very least . if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands , beetlejuice , gummo , or anything sort of strange and along those lines , try this one out .
( spoilers ? ? ) i was n't sure what to think of the movie . not too much of a kids film . definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying . but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by it . i was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had . ( even less without the credits ) and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature . but alas , they torture him . right until the end of the movie . those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars . but i do recommend the movie . even for a sequel . 8/10 quality : 9/10 entertainment : 7/10 replayable:7/10
this film is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best . the scenario is based on the novel by vladimir nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant . the photography of the film is excellent as is the acting of both turturro and watson . turturro definitely gives his best performance to date proving he 's worth much more than what we thought . watson also performs brilliantly . the story is about a phenomenal chess player ( turturro ) which is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life . the film is presented in a non linear time , with multiple flashbacks of luzhin 's childhood . through those , the complex character of luzhin is described . i have nothing more to say , but to suggest this film to anyone .
caution : may contain spoilers ... i 've seen this movie 3 times & i 've liked it every time . upon seeing it again , i 'm always reminded of how good it is . an hbo tv movie- very well done like most of their movies are- this would 've gotten oscars for it 's performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for tv . as i 'm sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here , this is the story of serial murderer , andrei chikatilo . he murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former soviet union . ( 3 victims were buried & could n't be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders . ) the story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst , victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea . a man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks , his part is essential to be sure . there is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in america , investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain & frustration . according to this acct , burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it . he followed the case to its conclusion , 3 years later . in this scene , his superior , general fetisov , played by donald sutherland , actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should 've given him a break sooner . rea 's performance is so well done , he does n't overact , chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer . he is a man with passion , but does n't show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies . he only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances . rea does so much with his face , his eyes , he does n't need to overact . he just * is * - his character , so frustrated after so long , at one point , driven to frustration , he actually says he 'd rather find 3 at one time than none in a year . of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die , he just wants some clues to catch this man . rea makes us feel for this man . he makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility . a mutant to be sure , chikatilo 's childhood was one which produces such `` monsters . '' the character of chikatilo is very well done by jeffrey demunn . he somehow ( impossible though it may seem ) elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself . perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong ? either way , his performance is very well done . donald sutherland as colonel fetisov ( later promoted to general ) also does a great job . he starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that does n't seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking burakov . but he eventually becomes more than just an assistant , he actually actively participates in helping burakov . there is also a very nice turn by max von sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for . although this movie deals with a morbid , grotesque and violent story , it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself . all around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay . the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does : give factual events & place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people * behind * the facts . 9 out of 10 stars
i love playing football and i thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it . this was a good hollywood/bollywood film and i am glad it won 17 awards . parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi . jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach . jazz ( parminder nagra ) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married . when jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets juliet ( kiera knightlety ) and joe ( jonathon rhyes meyers ) who is her coach . when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky ( archie punjabi 's ) wedding . at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play .
this is a gem , a real piece of americana for all that this implies . if you are self programed to resist `` life-afirming '' stories , just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe . and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story , no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story . chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors , and the complex , self-conflicted , bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight . the simple minded comments , refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track , expose the limitation of the commentator , not the writers or the acting . this is not for the cynical , or the simple minded .
you 'd think you 're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia , going through most of europe - italy , bulgaria , croatia , slovenia , turkey , before arriving in the middle east . but this is not a tour , and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights . reda 's father is in his twilight years , and wishes to do the haj . however , since walking and taking the mule is out of the question , he chooses to travel to mecca by car . he ca n't drive , and therefore enlists the help of reda , to his son 's protest , to get him there in their broken down vehicle . but reda does n't see the point of having him go along , when his dad could opt for the plane . he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he could n't understand . and hence , we set off in this arduous journey with father and son , being not the best of pals . the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair , the challenges they face , the weird people they meet , having to duke it out in varied weather conditions , and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car . we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other , the father trying to impose on his son , and the son trying to assert himself as an adult , but circumstances we see , reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water . through the many encounters , they actually team up quite well despite their differences . it 's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji , and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj . the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold , and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating . the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon , so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination . it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are . do n't miss this , and yes , book early - i was pleasantly surprised that this evening 's session was still a full house .
i love this movie , but ca n't get what is in this movie tht is not to like . people who do n't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert . but i ca n't believe that is mr. carrey behind all that makeup . and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this . and there is a new face in the movie . taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who . as the opens , the grinch ( jim carrey ) comes out of hiding . and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville . sicne we know that the whos love christmas . while the grinch does not like christmas . and even makes fun of little cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) who is the daughter of the town 's postmaster ( bill irwin ) . the movie was directed by ron howard . and the narrtor 's voice is done by anthony hopkins . and jeffrey tambor ( muppets from space ) is cast as the mayor of whoville . who does n't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time .
this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world . the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them . a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins . the settings are superb and almost movie like . alas , the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it 's safety devices stop working . picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s america and return to the jarada rendezvous . picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada . this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
at first i did n't think that ben affleck could really pull off a funny christmas movie , , boy was i wrong , my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all . james gandolfini was funny , , i really liked christina appelagate , and catherine o ' hara was good too , the storyline is what really sold me , , i mean , , too put up with family , , at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year , , and probably do n't get along with anyway , , you really do need as much alcohol as you 're system can stand to deal with christmas , , so i thought that the premise was good there , buying the family with 250000 dollars , was a little on the far fetched side , , but it turned out to work pretty good for me , , cause it was a riot all the way through , it shows the class struggle of the different families . it has lot 's of funny moments , including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy . all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too .
i 've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time . `` mystery men '' takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on tv like `` batman '' and `` captain nice '' and cartoons like `` underdog '' and `` super chicken . '' the same spirit lives in all of them : the comic tongue-in-cheek tone ; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous ; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries . it 's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary , and it 's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here . `` mystery men '' opens on a party at a nursing home . i wish kinka usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene . as it is , it looks like something george romero might have devised . we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else , or it feels patronizing . by the time the red eyes crash the festivities , you half expect tom waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout : `` just what this party needs -- a little excitement ! '' if writer neil cuthbert had any sense , he would have had waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same . it would have made for a rousing beginning , and a better introduction of the troublesome trio : the shoveler ( william macy ) ; the blue raja ( hank azaria ) ; and mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day . there are many other problems to `` mystery men '' than i care to go into ; among them that the villain casanova frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie , and he does n't . geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part ; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one . and rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre . you hope for the ripe theatrics of a john lithgow in `` the adventures of buckaroo banzai '' or the dry , debonair diffidence of a paul freeman in `` raiders of the lost ark . '' instead what we get is pastiche ; something half-baked and not fully realized . there are too many ideas running through `` mystery men '' for anyone to tie them neatly together , and that may be its deepest problem . but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love . ben stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes . this one is no exception , but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he 'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by jerry stiller and anne meara . his roy is related to all the put-upon , overly sensitive , chronically defensive types that woody allen made popular . and whether it 's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout ( the sleek claire forslani ) , or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero ( wes studi as the sphinx ) , or giving a new member of their `` elite '' group ( jeaneane garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen ) a hard time , he makes it always fun to watch . i could n't exactly say that about him in `` there 's something about mary . '' jeaneane garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of `` one true thing , '' not renee zellweger . i do n't think i have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father ( okay , so he 's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball , so sue me ) in the movies . and the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of emily watson 's spellbinding talks with god in `` breaking the waves . '' and in this version , the girl does n't die , and bells do n't ring in your head . william h. macy does something very difficult ; he makes stolid magnetic . you understand right away what 's attracted jenifer lewis ' lucille to eddie . you can also understand her exasperation . the barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge , but when eddie 's adorable , half-breed son looks up at his father and says `` i believe in you , daddy . '' to which lucille sighs and exclaims , `` roland , do n't encourage your father , '' you feel like standing and hailing neil cuthbert as a first-rate wit . with hank azaria ( whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in `` the birdcage '' ) and louise lasser ( has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in `` bananas '' and `` mary hartman , mary hartman ? '' ) as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware ; greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his publicist ; kel mitchell as `` invisible boy '' ; paul reubens as `` the spleen ; '' and lena olin who , if she did n't have the few lines in this movie that she has , would seem to be visiting the set .
on the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would n't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this is n't about football it is about discrimination and the women 's enthusiasm for the sport they love . the film opens on the day of a crucial world cup qualifying match between iran and bahrain , a girl is trying to get in to tehran 's azadi stadium by dressing like a boy , it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her . once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught , here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who 's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock . we never learn the character 's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary . as well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the `` disguise '' one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer . the girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in germany . the soldiers are n't shown as fundamentalists , they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman ca n't watch men 's sports do n't seem that convinced by their own arguments . it is a shame that this film ca n't be seen in iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary iranians are n't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere . the cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures .
`` the plainsman '' represents the directorial prowess of cecil b. demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual . it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok ( gary cooper ) , buffalo bill cody ( james ellison ) , calamity jane ( jean arthur ) , george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact , even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place . every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth , but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship . the film is an attempt to buttress custer 's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people , who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends . truly , this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment , but a pretty campy relic by today 's standards . transfer : considering the vintage of the film , this is a moderately appealing transfer , with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks . there 's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments . all in all , the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent , but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road . age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract . the audio is mono but nicely balanced . extras : forget it . it 's universal ! bottom line : as pseudo-history painted on celluloid , this western is compelling and fun . just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate !
you do not get more dark or tragic than `` othello '' and this movie captures the play fairly well , with outstanding performances by lawrence fishburne and irene jacob . fishburne 's expresses to the viewer othello 's torment as he falls prey to iago 's lies very convincingly , even providing a realistic epileptic episode . jacob is the loving and loyal wife who becomes either the instrument of iago 's revenge against othello , or the object of his wrath ( it is not clear which since no motive for iago 's behavior is offered ) . although kenneth brannagh ( sp ? ) displays his usual talent for shakespeare in this movie , he is somewhat marginalized . the characters of cassio and emilia also wander in and out of scenes even though they , like iago , seem more crucial to the plot . i have not checked the movie against the play to see how many lines were cut out , but i know that shakespeare tends to develop his characters , even the seemingly unimportant ones , very well . if i had any criticism of the movie it would be that the story unfolds too quickly , and that the relationships between some of the characters are not laid out more . the director had a great cast , and no one offered a bad performance . the relationship between cassio and othello and that between emilia and desdemona need to be further developed earlier in the film . i have a feeling that they were closer to each other than the movie suggests , although you get a sense of this very late into the movie . also , othello and desdemona need more time together . although their anguish is convincing , the amount of interaction they have with each other makes it seem like they just met . on the other hand , maybe the did just meet -- -like romeo and juliet . in brief : good performances , too short .
this is possibly the best short crime drama i 've ever seen . the acting is superb especially amanda burton who 's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some ... she does an amazing job balancing rachels/carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who 's lost a child , its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama . the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british tv/film . the ending , which i 'm not going to give away , is fantastic mainly because you do n't really get one ... ( you 'll get what i mean after you 've seen it ) this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you 're not touched by this you 're one cold hearted person .
indian summer is a warm , multi-character film , that would make a fine afternoon film ( with a bit of editing ) . the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose , which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present , when a group of adults from the `` golden age '' of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp , uncle lou . the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp , and form new memories in their latest stay . the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting , and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments . watching these people reminisce , and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well . it never goes to over the top and melodramatic , always keeping its warmth , charm and realism . i 've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well , and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself . for a warm , nostalgic character movie , i sincerely recommend .
mary poppins is definitely much better , but this is a lovely film nonetheless . angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price , and david tomlinson has great fun as mr. brown . their chemistry was just brilliant as well . the children , however just lacked the same sparkle , though paul is very funny and cute . the songs were actually not as bad as some people say , `` beautiful briny sea '' is the best , in fact all the songs are outstanding . the special effects were wonderful , that had plenty of magic , and the story is original enough . the highlights , though , like mary poppins , were the animated sequences . the underwater sequence was beautiful , but my favourite was the football match , which was absolutely hilarious . the only other criticism was that i did n't quite get the ending when i first saw it . all in all , a lovely film , that is hardly ever on . 8/10 bethany cox
there 's an inexhaustible hunger for `` basic training '' movies , so it 's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released . looks likely to have a well-deserved second life on dvd/vhs . tigerland is n't uniformly great by any means , there are some terribly cliched characters ( especially the portrayal of the nco 's , makes you long for the return of lee 'full metal jacket ' ermey ) but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom . charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get .
as for many on here i ca n't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood , i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters . to class this work of art as a `` cartoon '' could never do talespin justice , in fact it 's an insult to class it as a `` cartoon '' , talespin is an animation and nothing less , it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date , when disney `` pulled '' it from the air little did they realise what they did and i 'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since . i 'll take a moment to explain , from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck , disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since , they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey 's for the story 's , i could n't have my children watching the mind-numbing `` cartoons '' they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 % of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it , i could n't let that happen , which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80 's to the mid 90 's on a harddrive so one day my children could n't be corrupted by the `` cartoon crap '' of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin . talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it 's depth , charm , wit , compassion , emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today , do you see any of that content in say `` ed , edd and eddie or anything else you can think of ? , the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old 's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso . the next time you watch an episode of talespin ; take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation , even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again , the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted , even the vehicles are true to life , ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you 'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail . the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the `` deliberate mistakes '' or `` intended mistakes '' in each episode and some have two , for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say 's `` you 're up to something baloo '' and baloo replies `` who , me ! , i 'm as innocent as a schoolboy '' take a look into rebecca 's eyes , i wo n't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time . everyone elses comment 's are bang on and 100 % correct , i have nothing else to add that others have n't said already on here , disney , wake up and smell the coffee , you have been asleep for over a decade , stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing `` cartoons '' , we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible .
trio 's vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable . it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young . the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch . observation . in film it is n't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile . `` small morality '' storytelling is quaint ( or coy ) only in the eye of the beholder -- thankfully . story content -- well told -- can overcome it 's time , subject or place . ironically , there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era . inserting `` small morality '' content -- occasionally -- might provide a dimension lacking .
i enjoyed this film . it was funny , cute , silly , and entertaining . had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly do n't understand . no , it was n't `` the grapes of wrath '' or `` casablanca '' or even `` moonstruck '' , but it was an enjoyable film . julia was excellent playing the psychotic 'man behind the man ' . the story is a little silly to be sure , but it this is n't high drama , folks . i happened to see a review of the film , probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie . i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it , and i 'm glad i saw it . eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile , and i watch it a couple times a year .
no hidden agenda . pure scifi . all fun . i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad . i was a kid : ) the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten . the original one , starring the great movie star steve mcqueen ( bullet ) , is by far the better and only version anyone should see . the movie production is dated , but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time . i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord . 10/10 -zafoid
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year . i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my japanese . my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird , but i found it delightful ! koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun 's spirit made my day every time i tuned in ! i first saw him on `` hana yori dango '' , but i liked him much better in this ! although the characters are interesting and well-developed , i was disappointed to find that they did n't change very much throughout the show . their relationship grew , but they did n't really . still , a fun time had by all ( even for fukushima ! ) .
go , igor , go , you are the proof that slovenian films may , should and must be different . there 's soul in it , and this is rare . do n't let anybody put you down !
was this based on a comic-book ? a video-game ? a drawing by a 3 year-old ? there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all ; not the characters , not the dialog , not the plot , not the action . nothing . we have high-tech international terrorists/criminals who bicker like pre-school kids , stallone 's man-of-steel-type resilience towards ice-cold weather , dialog so dumb that it 's sometimes almost hilarious , and so on . even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb ( `` tango-tango '' ) . a film that entertains through some suspense , good action-sequences , and a nice snowy mountainous setting . oh , yes : and the unintentional humour . the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a `` swell '' time . then comes a sweat-inducing failed-rescue part , which should make anyone with fear-of-heights problems want to pull their hair out . and then we have some more bad dialog , and after that some more great action . this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell . stallone 's melodramatic exchange with turner , when they meet after a long time , is so soapy , so clichéd , so fake , and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self-respecting viewer . soon after this display of awful dialog-writing , we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane . the entire action is one big absurdity , but it 's mindless fun at its best . although the rest of the action is exciting and fun , the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film . after the landing , our master-criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker . they send stallone to fetch the first case of money , but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it ; they take most of his clothes off ( so he can freeze ) and they wo n't give him the equipment he needs ( so he can fall off ) . do these gangsters want their money fetched or not ? ? ? very silly . apparently they do n't trust stallone , but surely they know that they can always black-mail him by using rooker as a hostage . nevertheless , our gangsters make stallone 's climb difficult , if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are - lest there be any doubts . and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are , they overact , brag , and snicker in a truly evil manner . everyone convinced ? good . you 'd better be . otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children , just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal-clear to everyone . the old guy who flies the chopper ... how the hell did he fall for the trap ? firstly , he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals , and secondly , he must have heard stallone 's and rooker 's voices on the walkie-talkies . a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place , with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines . `` get off my back ! '' lithgow : `` i have n't even started climbing on your back . '' or , lithgow to stallone : `` we had a deal , but now we only have each other ! '' and as for lithgow 's gang of murderers : these guys never seem to want to kill immediately . they are very creative about it ; they philosophize , pretend that they are playing football with your body , and so on . stallone co-wrote this thing . i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it . i 'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i.q .
i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed . it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be . the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue . ( by the way , i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by hughes ) . the film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours - reds , yellows etc - which makes it look quite unique . the cast are also quite good . the prudish bunny packard and the devil-possessed delores salk are a stand out . the film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other 'lampoon ' series .
footlight parade is among the best of the 1930 's musical comedy extravaganzas . a snappy script and an all-star cast including jimmy cagney , the lovely joan blondell , dick powell , and ruby keeler make this film a cut above the rest . directed and choreographed by the creative genius busby berkeley , this film will have you grinning from ear-to-ear from start to finish . busby , of course , is the undisputed master of the hollywood musical with `` gold diggers of 1933 '' and `` 42nd street '' to his credit ( as dance director ) . footlight parade is graced by hundreds of scantily-clad chorus girls , a berkeley trademark . the elaborate dance numbers were shot with only one camera and busby was the first director to film close-ups of the dancers . his obsession with shapely legs and `` rear-view '' shots is amply demonstrated here . the overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing . our boy jimmy cagney plays chester kent , a producer of `` prologues '' or short musical stage productions that were performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talkies were shown . he 's surrounded by crooked partners , a corporate spy , and a gold-digging girlfriend . although cagney had a solid background in vaudeville , this was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents . joan blondell is memorable as cagney 's wise-cracking , lovestruck secretary . and ruby keeler is adorable , as always . the film climaxes with three outstanding production numbers , `` honeymoon hotel '' , `` the waterfall '' , and `` shanghai lil '' , each one a masterpiece and not likely to be duplicated in today 's hollywood where so-called `` special effects '' have replaced creative cinematography . claudia 's bottom line : clever and erotic , with some of the best musical production numbers ever put on celluloid . a thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp .
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year , and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing . these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success . i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie . it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality . capturing the essence of high school , high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters . i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film , it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter .
i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details . i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it . i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was , the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major , much different than the original cartoon . jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike .
oh dear we do n't like it when our super-hero love interest develops a brain do we ? something has happened to people , they have lost the ability to enjoy , a simple feel-good , love story/comedy ? kirsten dunst is a revelation - funny , sexy and real . i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i 'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too . the cast , acting and script is great , i watch a lot of films right across the board and i have n't seen one in this genre that has been as successful . those who disagree please tell me where i can find some ! i 'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits .
paul verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director : he started off making art-house films in his native netherlands before moving to hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd . 1983 's the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the u.s. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him . from the beginning of the fourth man it 's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author gerard . in a seeming homage to carol reed 's similarly titled 1949 film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts . the similarities end there , however , as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly . in spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door 's peephole . that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he `` lie { s } the truth until { he } no longer knows whether something did or did n't happen . '' the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it 's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which have n't occurred yet . between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and verhoeven 's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of do n't look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity . unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny as gerard 's deeply held catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality . he naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the biblical delilah though he fears she 'll remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors . in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis buñuel blush he substitutes a man he 's attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross . the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity : it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his `` lying the truth . '' the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience .
i do n't know the stars , or modern chinese teenage music - but i do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when i see one . kung fu dunk is pure hollywood in its values - it 's played for laughs , for love , and is a great blend of kung fu and basketball . everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this - the production values are excellent - and modern china looks glossier than los angeles here . the plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play ( and love and more etc ; ) is great - this is fresh , fun , and immensely entertaining . with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we 're seen in a long time . please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - a good sports comedy movie .
despite the other comments listed here , this is probably the best dirty harry movie made ; a film that reflects -- for better or worse -- the country 's socio-political feelings during the reagan glory years of the early '80 's . it 's also a kickass action movie . opening with a liberal , female judge overturning a murder case due to lack of tangible evidence and then going straight into the coffee shop encounter with several unfortunate hoodlums ( the scene which prompts the famous , `` go ahead , make my day '' line ) , `` sudden impact '' is one non-stop roller coaster of an action film . the first time you get to catch your breath is when the troublesome inspector callahan is sent away to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood . it gets only better from there with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for callahan to deal with along with a sherriff with a mysterious past . superb direction and photography and a at-times hilarious script help make this film one of the best of the '80 's .
the sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch . it 's smart , it 's quirky , it 's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people ca n't resist watching . the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters , set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families . for most of the time , you really do n't know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back , or buy them lunch . further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men , most of them murderers , but by god if you do n't love them too . i 've laughed at their wisecracks , been torn when they 've made err in judgement , and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal . the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this show 's subtext - people are n't always as they seem , and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds . if you have n't already , you most definitely should .
overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch , with plenty of laugh out loud moments . but , this movie is not for everyone . that is why i created this quick question-ere , if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick ( 1 ) do you enjoy crude sexual humor ? ( 2 ) do you enjoy alcohol related humor ? ( 2 ) do you enjoy amazingly hot girls ? ( 3 ) do you enjoy viewing boobs ? ( 4 ) do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs ? ( 5 ) did i mention all the nice boobies in this film ? if you noticed the spoiler alert , that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie , i myself have no idea what the plot was about . not that it matters .
it was clear right from the beginning that 9/11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined ; however , there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good ( or rather : bad ) as pearl harbor . it is a great luck that the first international release about 9/11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces , but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world . i 'm not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great ( youssef chahine 's , for example , has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamura 's has a really bizarre ending ) or that the segments are in the right order ( imamura 's , being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers , should open the film , not end it , alejandro gonzales inarritu 's should be the last one instead , as it 's the most impressive one ) . but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers . consider samira makhmalbaf 's opening segment , in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a one-minute silence . or idrissa ouedraogo 's part ( which features a bin laden-double so much resembling the real one that you 'll be shocked when you see him , i promise ) , in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden . there 's a surprisingly good ( and extremely angry ) segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls `` our tuesday september 11 '' - that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship - with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia . this could have become a terrible effort in anti-americanism , but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritu 's ( mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen , sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower , ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing ) and amos gitai 's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv ( hard to recognize , but this one is a masterpiece of choreography ) . all these different segments ( i have n't mentioned yet claude lelouch 's about a deaf girl , danis tanovic 's about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica , mira nair 's - strange , but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes - about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9/11 and sean penn 's with ernest borgnine ( yes , ernest borgnine ) as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine ) add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget . i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now . i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies . but , alas , it 's far more probable it will be remembered as a one-film-only effort . and as the one of the few 9/11 movies made by then that do n't reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience .
a truly adorable heroine who , at turns , is surprised and terrified by giblets , wrestles with mattresses , runs full-on into closed doors ... just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of 'the naked truth ' . i loved what i caught of this show : enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - tea leoni as , 'nora wilde ' ; cute , clownish , and wonderfully accident-prone - how refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it 's no wonder hollyood does n't seem to know how to cast her . but where-oh-where are the dvd releases ? the amount of ( bleep ) they release , it 's incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried . ( someone please correct me if i 'm wrong . )
the best martial arts movie ever made . this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did . a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax . jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.it 's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated , it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america . jackie rules ! ! ! !
a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too . the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( a mirror of the magnifiscent seven ) . there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too . you will love it ! ! 8 out of 10
a really cool flick . a must for any music snob . you do n't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie . before the movie , i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols . the only thing is required is an open mind . the movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre . the dandy warhols have a role in the film , as the 'rival band , ' but they are second fiddle to the bjm . the dandy warhols do n't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed , but then again , they did n't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the bjm.you ca n't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man , anton newcombe . by itself , it 's an insightful film and study on the music industry . just watch this film and enjoy .
i have seen this film only once , on tv , and it has not been repeated . this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again . usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement , but this one really scared me . do not read the next bit if you have'nt seen the film yet the scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead ( they 'd been poisoning her ) . he asks who the hell are you people anyway . one by one they give their true identities . the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says `` i am lilith , the witch who loved adam before eve '' .
> contrary to most reviews i 've read , i did n't feel this followed any of the other rock movies ( `` spinal tap '' , etc . ) the story was more unique , although i feel most people wanted to see the `` sex , drugs & rock and roll '' vices that the band kept alluding to . > as an american , i knew a few of the actors - spall , connelly & rea . surprised to find out `` brian '' /bruce robinson was in zifferedi 's ( < sp ? ) classic `` romeo & juliet '' . guess i 'll have to rent that next . > `` the flame still burns '' - my wife , who hails from mexico , did n't follow the english/british language too well , missed some of the jokes ( which i dutifully explained ) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene . she loves the song so much now . > funny that amazon.com has the soundtrack for $ 30+usd when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for $ 5.50usd . price non-withstanding , i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since .
hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away , however what is often overlooked are director 's first film efforts . who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx 1138 ? i remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation . so when i found a copy in a well known store for £9 i could n't resist but buy it . the odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it ( memory is funny that way ) . viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean 'moebius ' giraud some of the artwork is . i can only assume some influence here . when pazu catches a falling girl ( sheeta ) his adventure really begins - the quest for laputa - a reference to jonathan swift 's overlooked portion of gulliver 's travels . with healthy references to jules verne it 's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa . this is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral ' ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree . this is , in my opinion , the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of laputa , as opposed to the mechanised underground . although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals . the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same . it is incredibly stylish , i would not say 'slick ' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings , airships and the design and look of just about everything . myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime . buy this movie and treasure it .
without kirsten miller this project need n't have been completed . however with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is miss miller i would definitely recommend it . it looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance . wagner 's dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing , but his few scenes did n't detract from being entertained . mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line , the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster . the charismatic miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable . she plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be . i wish i had seen this on the big screen but alas i was fortunate to rent it before it was lost .
i saw his movie in dallas , texas when it came out in 1986 . i remember them giving out prizes for showing up to see the movie . after seeing the movie i can see why . the movie was not bad , nor was it great . the problem with this movie was that it tried to tell a side story . they created a new story , new characters and tried to wrap it around the masters saga . my biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of robotech masters attacking the earth . they even used the same scenes from the master saga but with different dialogue . as a kid , i loved the movie . but unfortunately i have n't seen it as an adult and ca n't give a better review . looking back i was disappointed but now i would love to see the movie and re-evaluate my stance on it . that being said , will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge ? i love robotech and ca n't wait for the shadows chronicles .
this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety . those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides . it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you are n't familiar with hong kong films , then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one . i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film . some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east . people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior . it 's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film .
an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly . watch as gene sings , acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations . some purely majestic , others pure corn . one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before `` singin ' in the rain '' . he is definately one of the all time greats . it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films , especially in kelly 's characters , the only main difference being that one is based in paris , the other in l.a . some have said that leslie caron 's acting was less than pure . perhaps cyd charisse , who was originally intended for the role could have done better , however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly . oscar levant 's short role in this film gave it just what it needed , someone who does n't look like gene kelly . filling the role as the everyman is n't an easy task , yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead . the song and dance routines are all perfection . even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without . seeing that there really was n't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable , minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you 'd spent four hours with them . ingenious ! i would have to rate this film up with singin ' since it is very similar in story and song . singin ' would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance . full recommendation . 8/10 stars .
this movie is n't as bad as i heard . it was enjoyable , funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season . it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music . when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection . it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year . i heard that ben 's character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time . take it for what is it , a christmas comedy with a love twist . i enjoyed it . no , it is n't titanic and it wo n't make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two . so go laugh and have a good time : )
i love these `` diaper baby '' movies ! you could n't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history . it is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh , which it does . how they ever got these kids to `` act '' i 'll never know . i think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30 's . you have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young , the stock market had crashed , the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world . the fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension , but then dinner for 25 cents is too . it was a different time with a totally different mind set .
i ca n't say that this film deserves anywhere near the amount of vitriol being heaped on it by some reviewers . yes , it 's bogged down by an overly-padded running time , hamfisted editing , and an overreliance on cheeseball special effects . and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch . on the other hand , it 's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines , a talented and earnest cast , and the classic underdog premise . macy , stiller , and azaria are brilliant as the `` core '' team , and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team . i ca n't say reubens or mitchell added much to the film overall , though each had a few chances to shine . the plot , as i said above , is your classic `` underdog-makes-good '' stuff . no surprises there , since you know they 're going to triumph . what makes it worthwhile is not the absurd , gaudy heroes and villains , but the dialogue and interplay between the characters . underneath it all , these people are children at heart , who just want to do right . the best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding . look at azaria 's relationship with his long-suffering mother ; macy 's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept cap . amazing 's secret identity ; stiller 's rage ( not unlike that one weird , spazzy kid you once knew who 'd always go into quivering , impotent rages on the playground ) ; garofalo 's desire to avenge her father . this childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place , is the true appeal of super-hero comics ; and underneath its parodic exterior , `` mystery men '' shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many . it never really gels into a satisfying whole , due to the huge number of half-baked subplots ( romance , family life , conflicts within the team , etc . ) , but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that . the fact that it 's supposed to be good , nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewers here , so i 'll issue a caveat : if you 're the type of viewer who finds his enjoyment of an itchy and scratchy cartoon ruined by the unexplained and illogical ( `` am i to believe this is some sort of .. * snort * ... _magic_ xylophone ? `` ) , then you are far too literal-minded and humorless for this film . go rent a sandler film instead . ( 7/10 )
i expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930 's romance . boy meets girl , they fall in love , boy loses girl , boy wins her back in the end . it was n't like that at all . clark gable plays con artist eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising . he is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into ruby ( jean harlow ) 's apartment , to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub , no less . instant chemistry.she plays hard to get for a while , but a girl can only resist that grin for so long . the heat between them is evident , and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code ! when a blackmail job goes bad and ruby ends up in a boarding house for `` troubled girls '' , she is miserable and , thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her , begins to believe that eddie will never come for her . harlow plays the hard-nosed , fast talking ruby perfectly . she never lets gable get all the good lines ! there is an especially moving scene with her playing `` their song '' on the piano that is acted perfectly . the last fifteen minutes have me crying every time . a truly sweet romance .
the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival , i thought it intriguing , fascinating , the sensitive bi-sexual artist . so very european , so very dutch ! i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex . get a grip ! this guy is a freeloader , living off of society . i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the `` spiderwoman '' is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year 's of ignoring mother 's advice about getting into cars ( and bed ) with strangers ! not only is he making outrageous sums of ( probably taxfree ) loot for making up stories ( lying guilt trip ) but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut , hence he hustles the beauty salon owner . then he has the nerve to complain about the bill ! but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made . on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont 's camera work and one of paul verhoeven 's earlier films . hmmm , maybe the world has n't changed so very much after all ?
it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it 's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team . there are no parents or teachers to speak of , no school , and boys are represented by one peripheral figure , the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused . pauline aquart is the youngest of the three , only aspiring to join the team she so much admires . she 's kind of odd looking . she 's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long , bony limbs , big feet , and no derriere to speak of . she 's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips . after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling . adele haenel is older -- more , well , more developed physically . what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit , sauntering around , teasing the boys , swishing her long blond hair . but she 's not what she seems . or is she ? i could n't quite figure it out . the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency . no wonder francois is always sniffing after her . there 's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere 's character . she 's on the team too but she 's dumpy and plain , and sensitive about it , and has an intense crush on francois . blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance . the movie deals with the relationships between these three , meaning intrigues , deceptions , hidden feelings , and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another . this is of course a tricky topic . it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele . not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie . the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on , and what little sex there is under the covers , sometimes literally . i do n't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much , partly because it 's suggestive rather than expressed through action , partly because it 's complex , and partly because i 'm not sure i got it all . let me give an example . okay . adele is the girl the others envy . she 's also quite distant and self satisfied . on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all , from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from . she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio . when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team , adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys . a superior and self-indulgent narcissist , you know ? but then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she 's still a virgin . really ? yes , really . pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she 'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her . pauline , now drawn sexually to adele , performs the task with subdued relish . now adele would really like to get it on with a man , preferably older and experienced . so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room . the two girls stand there staring at one another , neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other . but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins , reaches up , and kisses adele on the lips . adele steps back , smiling , and says , `` there now , that was n't so bad , was it ? `` , and then walks back into the club . that 's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele -- but what the hell is going on ? initially , adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child , later like a close friend , finally like a potential lover -- and the minute pauline responds , adele walks off satisfied . is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men ? does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude ? i do n't know . i 've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio , the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity , but i 've only skipped her for considerations of space . should you see it ? by all means . ( just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids . ) for men , some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique , this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot .
insisting that martin luther king 's inspirational spirit resides not just in american civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere , danish helmer niels arden oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 danish middle school . more specifically , it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named frits ( janus dissing rathke ) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster svendsen ( bent mejding ) . adapted from a true story , the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving . a battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a `` dead poets society '' more than a `` matilda '' . it treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off frits as a young boy becoming a young man , manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money .
i would n't go so far as to not recommend this movie , since the only problems i have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems . that does n't make it bad , just not something i 'd go far . it is a little saccharine , so i might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this . however , all of that goes out the window when that squirrel ( the one in all the trailers ) comes on-screen . his time is limited , but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey , could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it 's getting intolerably dull . that does n't save the movie , but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where i could n't stop laughing . ' and of course , visually it wo n't disappoint , but that 's almost a given with pixar flicks . of all of their stuff , i 'd put this at the bottom ... but that is n't in itself bad .
the three main characters are very well portrayed , especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos . he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser/invader . the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business , the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes . how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition . 9-9,5 out of 10 .
first things first , this movie is achingly beautiful . a someone who works on 3d cg films as a lighter/compositor , the visuals blew me away . every second i was stunned by what was on screen as for the story , well , it 's okay . it 's not going to set the world on fire , but if you like your futuristic blade runner-esquire tales ( and who does n't ? ) then you will be fine . i do have to say that i felt the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole . i saw it at the cinema in english , but i am hoping that there is a french version floating around somewhere . definitely worth seeing .
level one , horror . when i saw this film for the first time at 10 , i knew it would give me nightmares . it did . surprisingly , as i recall , it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused them . level two , psychoanalytic theory . later as an adult , i saw the story for what it was : what if the savage , unrestrained instincts we all repress became manifest . level three , pure science fiction . the best way plausibly to realize the plot 's `` what if '' is through the science fiction genre . this is pure science fiction , not the `` cowboys in space '' that passes for the genre today . after 43 years , forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films . if planning a remake , skg or lucas , watch out !
the man in the white suit , like i 'm all right jack , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . alec guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an ... err ... accident in a college laboratory ) . he manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . when the film begins he is in michael gough 's company , and gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law ( cecil parker ) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs . while having lunch with parker and parker 's daughter ( joan greenwood ) , gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab 's unexpectedly large budget problems . he reads the huge expenditures ( due to guinness 's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee . guinness goes on to work at parker 's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with gough - but parker discovers it too . greenwood has discovered what guinness is working on , and convinces parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . the result : guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it 's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever . guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . he sees guinness as selling out to the rich . but when he explains to them what he 's done , they turn against him . if everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! soon parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by gough , ernest theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and howard marion-crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . they seek to suppress the invention . with only greenwood in his corner ( although parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public . in the end , guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . but he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all . it 's a brilliant comedy . but is the argument for suppression valid ? at one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . there is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? what happened to fashion changes and new styles ? and the cloth is only made in the color white ( making guinness look like a white knight ) . we are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . would n't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . as such it is brilliant . but those questions i mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing guinness ' invention
made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet , and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new york 's finest shone on it 's darkest day . i first saw this when i was a young naive 12 year old , and at that age it still touched me . knowing how serious 9/11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9/11 . we were finding out who the heroes were , how there everyday lives were composed , and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves . these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them . watch if you can , this is the best documentary i have personally ever seen .
two sorcerers battle in the fourth dimension , one ( brian thompson as a kabal ) trying to destroy the earth , the other ( jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid ) trying to save it . `` doctor mordrid '' is an enjoyable fantasy fare which offers plenty of cheese.the plot is pretty silly and the gore is completely absent , but the film is very short and entertaining.so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look.my rating:7 out of 10 .
if you 're not in the mood for more than an hour long movie than this film could give you some variation . what i love is the ongoing surprises . it 's not only once that you want one or more of the short film in 'new york i love you ' to be continue . yeah , some of the short films makes you curious , some of them very short , some of them longer , some of them has it definite ends , some of them do n't . most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city . it shows many different nationality background . many of it , make it feels the same way where i have been once went to a capital city in other countries for a year where it has many people came from different countries . this movie explore many type of things you might have known , but for all the characters it 's a new things . maybe some of you have traveled abroad alone to stay for a year or two just to feel something new , meet new people ; feel dreamy , sad , but the kind of sad you looking for because it is just that bored you were in your own home . you might want to reliving it again , by watching this .
one of the first of the best musicals , anchors aweigh features several memorable musical sequences , such as kelly dancing with jerry the mouse , kelly dancing with 7-year-old sharon mcmanus , sinatra singing with jose iturbi playing piano , kathryn grayson singing with iturbi conducting , and much more . the technicolor is perfect , with some innovative camera work such as seeing a piano played from beneath , through transparent keys , and grayson singing , seen through the finder of another camera . the plot is thin , but you get involved from kelly 's & sinatra 's enthusiasm . sailor 's on leave , they have to take home a runaway boy ( dean stockwell ) and sinatra falls for his aunt . to set him up with the aunt ( grayson ) , kelly suggests that sinatra can get her an audition with jose iturbi . but sinatra 's young and naive in this one , and in his own sung words falls in love too fast . while they 're trying to contact iturbi , who 's never available , he starts to fall for another girl ( barbara britton ) ; but kelly 's now falling love with grayson . anchors aweigh is most often remembered for the combination live-action / cartoon sequence with tom and jerry , but there 's a lot more here that 's worth a look . i 'm giving it nine stars because , while it 's not quite as good as the best musicals - singin ' in the rain , the music man , oklahoma - it is one of the first of their class of technicolor big productions ( perhaps meet me in st. louis was the first ) , and better than most others .
debut ? wow -- cross-eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that i 've watched in the past year , making it hard to believe that cross eyed is the writer 's debut film . i mean -- i logged onto imdb to find more films by this writer ... because cross eyed has that unique signature -- you want to see what else this writer might have to say . these days , its rare to see a movie that is well-written , well-directed , well-edited and well-acted . for me -- cross eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about -- combining the best of all film elements to create a clever , artistic and poignant tale . more , please .
atlantis : the lost empire is a better movie than i thought . i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations . true , this movie started slow , but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking . the story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named milo . milo believes in the fabled atlantis . along with friends of his grandfather , he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own . along the way , he must endear friendship , betrayal , trust , and more . the voice cast is great . they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent . the music is nothing special but likable anyway . the animation is not the best , but it is still good enough . overall , this is a good family movie for all ages . i rate this movie 9/10 .
`` holes '' is my all-time favorite movie ! so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on dvd this upcoming september . i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were . the director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form . also , all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters , especially max kasch as zigzag . props to all those involved in making this movie , it was a real success ! 10 out of 10 stars , i definitely recommend it for everyone to see !
on september 11th , 2001 , millions were killed ; but 2,819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner . they were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings , but more importantly , people . this film takes an in-depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives . charlie fineman ( played by adam sandler ) , a former dentist living in new york , loses his wife and three children on september 11th as they were on their way to los angeles . emotionally annihilated by the events , he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life ; including his in-laws and his best friend ( played , respectively , by robert klein , melinda dillon , and mike bender ) . he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life . this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson ( played by don cheadle ) who fineman does n't seem to remember . the two begin to catch up , but fineman believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help . slowly , but surely , fineman regains his trust for johnson . while all this is happening , alan johnson 's life is going down the wrong path . he is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice . one day , a patient of his named donna remar ( played by saffron burrows ) attempts to make a move on him , telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him . this is an unwelcome surprise to dr. johnson since he is a married man with two children . as he is coming home from work on a particular workday , he sees his old friend ( fineman ) and tries to flag him down . he is unsuccessful , but he gets another opportunity and persuades fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up , despite the fact that fineman does n't know who he is . one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif . one of fineman 's physiological crutches is music , particularly springsteen and other classic rock artists . when fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant , he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music . when the film was over , i had me thinking : how would i cope with the loss of my family ? how would i deal with such a tragic events . it 's something we do n't really think about too often . we always think they 'll be there and we often take them for granted , whether we intend to or not . we usually realize how important they are when it 's too late ; and a blow like that can destroy someone physically , emotionally , and physiologically . i really do n't know how i would be able to deal with something like that . would i face the problem head on , cope , and move on with my life or would i just put my headphones on and block the world ?
i really like this movie . bozz is an ultra-cool , not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war . his persona is similar in a way to yossarian in catch-22 , joseph heller 's classic novel about men and war . this film , however , is not set in a war zone , but in a pre-war combat prep training . this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause . colin farrell is brilliant as bozz , a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him . bozz is totally cool and non-plussed , testing and tweaking his military superiors , getting their goat at every opportunity . he is a jesus christ figure with a psychology degree , `` saving '' his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need , the way out of this man 's army . the acting and action is crisp and believable and as a `` sleeper '' , tigerland goes down with apocalypse now and full metal jacket as one of the top three vietnam films in my opinion . five stars , a top pick .
i saw it at cinema mk2 hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris . a very pretty film about three 15 years old teenagers , all of them just at about the same psychologically stages . many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age & our first feelings about sexual relations . it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism , but even in that case she does n't corrupt the likelihood of the story . you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere . i fund the young actresses of talent , special mention with floriane and marie , very convincing . there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is : impressing !
every country which has a working film industry has some sane ( and maybe some insane ) artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when you 're a part of this country . i guess hundstage is such a movie . you see the lowest level of austria 's society , dirty , disturbed , weird , hateful . but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses . and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them 'normal ' because they 're doing it through their whole life . from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austria 's art movies . but if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society . a society that is going more insane from day to day , creating their own rules that nobody else can understand , cave the social system from within . and you see the people . sitting in the park , standing at the opposite street corner , queuing in the same line . maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit . maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house . you start to hate them without exactly knowing why . you 'll try to get away - but you can not . maybe you 'll end up like them . but it seems 'normal ' for you because you 're doing it through your whole life now ... life is n't so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world . it has beautiful people ... but some are also ugly . there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best ... but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so far . a very pessimistic movie .
what starts out as generational conflict in this movie , ends in understanding , solemnity and grace . the movie meanders through europe with the father and the young son cramped in a car over 3000 miles . the cramping forces lifestyles , beliefs and life skills to collide . there 's really no clear winner . it all adds up in the end as experience , experience of multiple layers of life . for those interested in understanding islam , this movie offers a generous and gentle outlook , without being pushy about the agenda . it 's a coming of age story for the young son , his dismissive and rebellious nature turning to openness for receiving more ways of life .
this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best . at the same time , it looks realistic and unrealistic , just knowing that the movie is fake . the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways . a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address , and it includes a manga video , showing the torture . the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die . some scenes are shocking , such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched 100 times , because you see punches in nearly every movie . this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people 17 or older . 9/10
a rousing adventure form director george stevens ( before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948 's i remember mama and 1956 's giant ) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow . loosely based on rudyard kipling 's poem of the same , gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india . the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold . their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades , and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger-inspired space opera star wars ( 1977 ) to the similarly-plotted raiders of the lost arc ( 1981 ) . the biggest reason for the picture 's success , however , is the pitch-perfect performances by the film 's trio of extremely charismatic actors . victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy , cary grant is the ultimate comic foil , and douglas fairbanks , jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn . the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon , and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what 's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe , who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength . a huge hit in its day ( the film was reportedly the second-biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind ) , and it remains arguably the best film of its kind .
seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately . this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic . i happened to see the dubbed version but i 'm on my way right now to grab the dvd remaster with original chinese dialogue . still , the dubbing did n't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour : `` poison clan rocks the world ! ! ! '' the story-telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue , suspense , and inter-personal relationships . you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace . the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed . it 's like watching real animals fight each other , but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms . such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema . the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film 's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution . ... of course , if you just want to see people pummel each other , along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture , be my guest !
before watching this film i had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film , but listening was n't doing it for me so i planned on watching it and wow ! ned beatty , ronny cox , jon voight and burt reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all . the character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person , but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend . the acting , dialogue is very very real , as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting . reynolds character `` lewis '' was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man ( i was impressed with his performance ! ) jon voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most , the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end ( his character transition was excellent ) . ned beatty and ronny cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and do n't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too , and they did ... i really was amazed at director boorman 's vision of dickey 's novel , very impressed . you can not go your whole life without watching this film . i give it eight out of ten stars , extremely impressed .
abhay deol 's second film , written by imtiaz ali , maiden directorial effort by shivam nair . soha probably has her first ( ? ) meaty role as megha , a girl who has run away from home and is waiting at the delhi marriage registrar 's office for her boyfriend dheeraj ( shayan munshi ) to meet her . she waits and waits and finally is spotted as a damsel in distress by ankush ( abhay deol ) . they spend many days together as he extricates her from one distressing situation after another and finally falls in love with her . then the boyfriend returns ! aage pardey par dekhiye ! sound familiar ? this is yet another adaptation of dostoyevsky 's white nights with a tiny bit of borrowing from le notti bianchi ( very tiny though - ankush keeps the lovers apart by telling the boyfriend she is dead ! ) . but this is an earthier and more realistic ( duh ) adaptation than the much hyped and overblown saawariya . i wonder why no one brought this little gem up when we were all discussing saawariya like crazy a few months ago . the delhi settings are wonderful - there is the obligatory run through old delhi , shots of jama masjid from a roof top , connaught circus , streets with rickshaws ( what ? how ? ) . the colorful light fixtures in the hotel are enough to tell you this is a seedy joint with rooms for hire by the hour ! the more i see of abhay the more i like this young man . in this second film he is quite good as the for hire witness who is given a purpose in life by a beautiful woman . soha looks beautiful , and when she smiles she fits the role , but i found her unconvincing in the more serious moments . i am not quite sure that she has it in her to be a great actress , or maybe she will blossom late like the brother . the music by himesh reshammiya is not that great and in fact the movie falters at the songs , they kind of interrupt the narrative and do not sit well with the characters trying to sing them . the supporting cast is excellent and i give this white nights adaptation a thumbs up . btw - the fact that i love abhay deol 's cute dimples has nothing to do with my rating .
in watching this early demille work , it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille . his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable . his pacing is very good , enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so . it is a pity that he was n't as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films . this was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely . she was remarkable , quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions . the ending is wonderful .
`` panic in the streets '' is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as `` a streetcar named desire '' , `` on the waterfront '' and `` east of eden '' . kazan already won an oscar in 1947 , before this movie , so he was not a completely unknown at the time . still `` panic in the streets '' is mostly a movie that passed under the radar . the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script . it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir elements . the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility . the cast is fairly unknown ( especially at the time it was released ) but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles . especially palance impresses as the tough gangster boss , with a very powerful looking face . still the movie drags a little at some points . the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from . yet , `` panic in the streets '' remains a perfectly watchable movie , mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch . for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch . 8/10
to be honest , i did n't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time . but i guess the trouble is that i have n't seen it in a theater . big mistake ! because the # 1 thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is the cinematography . try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system . the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level ( and a commercial potential ) . the more i see it , the more i like it . it 's definitely one of renny harlin 's best movie . this guy knows about action . die hard 2 , the long kiss good bye , etc . and it 's particularly good in this movie . the special effect are great and spectacular . stallone really needed that movie get back with success . still good to see him !
jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing . it 's like watching a no frills music video today . the jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street . i had never heard her sing before , bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday . that 's a compliment folks . their instrumental work is tops as well . with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes , this film is to be watched and treasured . no great production values , just a lot of good music .
another entry in the `` holiday horror '' category that fills the shelves of your local video store . the * spoiler * `` wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the 'cool ' kids who wronged him '' plot will of course be familiar to those who 've watched it before . and those who 've seen it before will probably watch it again ; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it . marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz , denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy -- go with the flow and enjoy it . oh , and i loved the creepy mask .
too bad a couple of comments before me do n't know the facts of this case . it is based on actual events , a highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington , de/philadelphia pa region from '96 through 2000 . i have to admit i was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period . of course i immediately pointed out that the actress ( who i really like in cold case ) who played fahey looked nothing like her ( anne marie was actually prettier ) . i have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano 's and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period . details of the case were right on ... no deviations of dramatic effect ... even down to the carpet , gun , furniture , and cooler . in conclusion , i also wanted to add that i have met tom carper many times at various functions ( a good man , despite being a politician ) and i am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime . guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars .
two dysfunctional brothers ( philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke ) get tired of competing for who is the bigger f * * * -up and who daddy ( albert finney ) loves more , so they hatch a hair-brained scheme to rob mommy and daddy 's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh . sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970 's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong , and boy , do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved . lasciviously concocted by screenwriter kelly masterson and classically executed by director sidney lumet , `` before the devil knows you 're dead '' uses the heist as its mcguffin to delve deep into family drama . contrary to popular belief , sidney lumet is not dead . at age 83 , he has apparently made a deal with the devil to deliver one last great film . lumet was at his zenith in the 1970 's with films like `` dog day afternoon , '' `` serpico , '' and one of my favorite films of all time , `` network '' . he has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements ( graphic sexuality , violence , and playing with time-frames and pov 's ) into a crackling , vibrant , lean , mean , and provocative melodrama . one can only hope that some of the modern greats ( like scorsese or spielberg ) who emerged during the same decade lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age . lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters . as the cast waltzes through finely appointed manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room . also amazing is how lumet utilizes the multiple pov and shifting time-frame approach . the coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds christopher nolan and alejandro gonzalez inarritu seem like amateur hour . of course , what lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives . philip seymour hoffman has never been , and most likely never will be , better than he is here . albert finney 's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold . ethan hawke , normally a nondescript pretty boy , is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks . the coup-de-grace , however , is the series of scenes between hoffman and marisa tomei , eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife . lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since william holden taunted beatrice straight right into a best supporting actress oscar in `` network . '' the devil of any great film is in the details , from albert finney 's tap of his car 's trunk that wo n't close due to a fender bender , to the look amy ryan ( fresh off her amazing turn in `` gone baby gone '' ) gives her ex-husband ethan hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he wo n't keep , to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids , to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it ( my favorite line being the hilariously threatening `` do you mind if i call you chico ? '' ) to the excellent carter burwell score . `` before the devil knows you 're dead '' is the film of the year . if something emerges to best it , then we know a few other deals must 've been brokered with old scratch .
i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years . it really is a fun little film , with a bunch of faces you did n't know were in it . arkin shines as always . check it out ; you wo n't be dissappointed . by the way , it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging , it is widescreen . the transfer is rather poor , but at least the whole movie is visible . ; - )
very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas . ca n't say much about this film without giving away the story . i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture . everybody has his or her own agenda . nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises . well written with good performances by all .
given the title , this first follow-up to quartet ( 1948 ) obviously reduces the number of w. somerset maugham stories which comprise the film . the author still turns up to introduce the episodes , but there ’ s no epilogue this time around ; by the way , while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to r.c . sheriff , here maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation , as well as noel langley ( though it ’ s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison ) . as can be expected , much of the crew of quartet has been retained for the second installment – though this also extends to at least three cast members , namely naunton wayne , wilfrid hyde-white and felix aylmer ( the last two had bit parts in the episode from quartet entitled “ the colonel ’ s lady ” ) . while trio ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor ( slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time ) , it ’ s still done with the utmost care , acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain . “ the verger ” tells of a church sexton ( james hayter ) – for which the story ’ s title is another word – who ’ s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest ( michael hordern ) simply because he ’ s illiterate . rather than rest on his laurels , despite his age , he not only takes a wife ( his landlady , played by kathleen harrison ) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered – and , with business flourishing , this is developed into a whole chain . the last scene , then , sees him pay a visit to bank manager felix aylmer who , not only is surprised to learn of hayter ’ s lack of education , but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were – to which the wealthy ( and respected ) tobacconist replies , with some measure of irony , that he had the calling to be a verger ! the second episode , “ mr . know-all ” , is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging : a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man ( nigel patrick ) , british despite his foreign-sounding name of kelada , who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun . naunton wayne and wilfrid hyde-white are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most – the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of patrick ’ s attentions to his pretty wife ( anne crawford ) . during a fancy-dress party , however , the passengers decide to enact their ‘ revenge ’ on kelada by having one of them impersonate him ( a jest which he naturally doesn ’ t appreciate ) ! ; still , it ’ s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character – told by crawford that the necklace she ’ s wearing is an imitation , wayne challenges patrick to name its price…but the latter realizes immediately that it ’ s the genuine article and that this would compromise crawford ’ s position if he were to tell , so kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer ! as can also be deduced from the title , “ sanatorium ” deals with the myriad patients at such a place – run by andre ' morell ; the protagonist is a new intern , roland culver , who wistfully observes the various goings-on . the narrative , in fact , highlights in particular three separate strands of plot – one humorous ( the ‘ feud ’ between two aged scots long resident at the sanatorium , played by finlay currie and john laurie ) , one melodramatic ( the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient raymond huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife betty ann davies ) and one bittersweet ( the romance between naïve but charming jean simmons and dashing cad michael rennie which , in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that morell has diagnosed simmons as a ‘ lifer ’ while rennie only has a few years left to him , leads the couple to the altar ) .
richard dreyfuss stars in `` moon over parador , '' a 1988 paul mazursky film also starring raul julia , sonia braga , jonathan winters and charo . dreyfuss plays a new york actor , jonathan nolan , in the caribbean country of parador to make a film . when the dictator dies suddenly , the secret police chief ( julia ) who is the one actually controlling the dictator and the country , drafts jonathan to play the dictator , having noticed the resemblance between them . soon jonathan is ensconced in the palace as alphonse simms , and simms ' prostitute girlfriend madonna ( braga ) who realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can . mazursky , who appears in drag as simms ' mother , gives us a look at how the cia operates in third world countries . the winters character , supposedly a salesman , is actually a cia operative . the film , however , flirts with but does n't really tread on very serious ground and is more of a send-up , and a funny one at that . richard dreyfuss does a fabulous job as jonathan the actor and alphonse the dictator , creating two separate characters and nailing both . the gorgeous sonia braga is great as madonna , and raul julia hands in a wickedly funny performance as strausmann , the man behind the dictator . it 's one of those performances where you never quite know what the character is thinking - he can be pleasant or turn psycho at any moment . charo is on hand as a maid and manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time . a very good film , not a big blockbuster , but very entertaining .
an enthralling , wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese . many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works , particularly the earlier ones , the silent era . very enjoyable despite being a bit long , i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet . required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work .
i agree with what `` veinbreaker '' wrote with regards to the `` ahhhh '' feeling you get at the end of this movie . i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film , the songs were well written and interesting , especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings . it 's trippy . nighy was fab in his role , nail `` nailed '' it , beano was the typical drummer , and rea kept it together . bruce robinson was awesome . helena was a lovely girlfriend . but i felt juliet aubrey 's performance was gorgeous . the scenes between aubrey & robinson killed me ! perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on ! too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out ! they ought to ! i 've told all my musician friends . great quote by jimmy nail 's character : `` it 's supposed to be rock & roll , not the phantom of the f * * * * * g opera ! ''
the plot is real horrific , the atmosphere really depressive , unusual for a low-budget production like that , and at least , for a german production . a little bit of indian spirituality , mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together . the development of plot and characters are great , the sets very close to reality , without any studio-atmosphere . it could be perfect , but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing , what do n't inevitably have to be typically for low-budget movies : 1 . ) the cast sometimes is not more than average . almost every actor look like a layman . some of them do a good , or a very good job , but some are acting like the actors of crappy german court-shows ! but i was very , very disappointed of the acting of mathieu carrière ! his acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below-average ! but that could be the reason , why he today takes part in crappy german soaps or tv-series on private channels . 2 . ) the dialogs are sometimes on soap-opera-level . 3 . ) the bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand , what the characters are saying . i saw it on dvd and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again . it caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors ! but all in all , it is an interesting movie , worth to watch it , far beyond the commercially movies , which are often more terrible .
the performance of every actor and actress ( in the film ) are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be ; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again . however , i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors ' and director , attenborough 's credits that puzzles me : are n't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent , long lasting film for the audience ? i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one ( possibly one of the `` knowledgeable '' personnel ( insider ) of the film .
i love bad movies . not only , because they often are as entertaining as 'really ' 'good ' films ( like pirates of the caribbean series and other hollywood pathos ) , but they often are far better than those films . and that 's the reason why i love italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s . and that 's the reason why i especially love this movie , the barbarians & the company . director ruggero deodato has made some actually very good movies , like house on the edge of the park , and also his atlantis interceptors and live like a cop , die like a man are enjoyable action movies . but this is really bad . the barbarians is so idiotic movie . peter and david paul as the barbarian brothers kutchek and gore are very funny , because of their lack of charisma and acting skills . but if they ca n't act , they yell and scream every time they do something important . in one scene people try to hang the barbarian brothers , and they escape very extraordinary way . bad acting , bad special effects , very stupid story , bad direction , actually everything is bad in this movie . i ca n't describe how much i laughed when i watched this first time . the barbarians & the company is camp classic everybody should see once . if you thought plan 9 from outer space is fun camp , this will be a real killer .
i liked antz , but loved `` a bug 's life '' . the animation that was put into this paid off . i will definitely be getting this on dvd . by the way , disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape . ( i heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format ) . most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest ! i only saw one of the two sets , but i ca n't wat to see the other one !
good times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the chicago projects . whether or not , you live in the inner cities , ghettos , suburbs , or rural countryside , this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family . but they do n't dwell on it . they find humor and have strong family values and morals . despite the story behind the scenes , this show was worth keeping on the air except i did n't like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther rolle who fought hard to keep the family together . but despite all the fights behind the scenes , good times was a show about a family . we all loved jj 's dynamite and his antics . we watched janet jackson 's penny grow up a little . this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs , gangs , and alcoholism . without being to preachy , the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto .
ok , so the fx are not high budget . but this story is based on actual events . not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors , even richer ! ! as most movies that are based on books , there are somethings that just do n't fit . only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events , not a knock-off as most people believe it is ! ! this movie is in no way related too twister ! other than both movies are about tornadoes . for those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie , there are a couple of things you need to remember ... the actual `` night of the twisters '' was june 3 , 1980 . so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events . try think how far storm research has advanced in that time . it happened in a larger town ; grand island , nebraska is the third largest city in the state . even though the movie calls the town something else , and says it 's a small town . for the real story check out : http : //www.gitwisters.com/
gypo nolan ( victor mclaglen ) is as poor as anyone on earth . living in 1920s ireland , gypo and his fellow irishmen are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressive brits . one particular rebel , wanted for murder by the english , arrives back into town secretly . he thinks he can trust his friend gypo , but the £20 reward proves too tempting . gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness . meanwhile , the other irish rebels are searching for the informer . right away , gypo , with money burning a hole in his pocket , is their main suspect , but they , who are his friends , do n't want to believe it . the story of the informer is simple in its plot , but complex in its moral and emotional issues . it 's easily one of john ford 's most emotionally involving films . what gypo did was wrong , but we can certainly understand his motives . we also understand his sorry character , and there 's a lot of sympathy that arises for him . the script is very suspenseful , as well . it 's the kind of suspense where we are pretty sure we know how everything will end up , so we have to grit our teeth and bear along with it . the acting is remarkable . victor mclaglen , who acted in many of ford 's films , probably gave his best performance here ( and won an oscar for it ) . every other performer in the film deserves his or her kudos . in addition to an amazing script and acting , the informer is one of john ford 's most expressionistic films . i love the darker side of ford . in its mood , as well as in its themes , the informer reminds me of two of my other favorite ford films , the long voyage home ( 1940 ) and the fugitive ( 1948 ) ; it 's also a bit similar to the grapes of wrath ( 1940 ) in these respects . 10/10 .
yeah , it 's low budget . yeah , it 's one of candy 's earliest films , but it is maybe his funniest ! john candy was not so far removed from his sctv days in `` going berserk '' and it shows . if you do n't crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand-cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them ( huh ? , see the movie ! ) , or the way euguene levy ( the creator of kong fu yu ) is talking to his mom on the phone , or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse ! if you like the john candy of `` only the lonely '' this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see , but if you enjoy the sctv days of john candy , this movie is a must see !
why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like the godfather . titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great acting , directing , effects , music and generally everything . this movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they did n't like it any more so most of the world decided to agree . there is nothing wrong with this movie . all i can say is that this movie , not only being the most heavily oscar awarded movie of all time , the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies i 've ever seen . apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time . the only movies that come close to being like all the star wars and the lord of the rings trilogy or anything by the masters hitchcock or spielberg or tim burton . these are all good movies and directors but none match up to james cameron 's masterpiece titanic .
i think `` anyway ... '' is a kick-ass movie . really . tom barman spent like years making it , and it shows : every scene is polished , has a meaning , ... i guess most agree on that . one thing many people tend to criticize is the `` lack '' of story . i 'm afraid that that 's an effect of us being overwhelmed with `` traditional '' storytelling , all the time . i mean : what you can achieve with a book , you ca n't achieve with a movie , what you can achieve with a movie , you can not achieve it by just telling it to a buddy . the problem is that we 're so used to movies , series , ... to be just a filmed version of a story ; a visual recording of events -just like when you watch the news- that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics : a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events . and i stress the idea of `` unusual events '' : most people see on tv in the news , in movies , series , ... very unusual things , once-in-a-lifetime situations . and here , in `` anyway ... '' , there are unusual events , but not in the same `` hollywood big explosion '' kind of way : guy gets fired , couple back together , car gets stolen ... and of course very usual things . and that 's strong : just being able to appreciate all of that , that universe , that 's art . and i agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies , that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central . but not like in traditional visual movies ( visual blockbusters such as the matrix ) ; it serves the characters and remains deeply human . i mean , in every shot you feel the love that tom barman has for antwerp and urban lifestyle . and he has no point with this movie , like to `` learn '' us something ; and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists . he just shows everyday people with everyday lives , he shows a city , all with their good and bad sides and says : this is us , that 's our city , that 's life , let 's enjoy it . so basically , `` anyway ... '' is not only that super groovy movie , it also has a much stronger `` message '' ( it 's not explicit , maybe even not intended ) than most movies how really intend to pass a message . one drawback : now , we 'll have to wait five years to see the next barman pic , and everyone will expect so much of it ...
pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time . if the murderer wanted to whack the dame , why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit ? involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous , not to mention all the mouths you 'd have to worry about staying shut . why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word ? are there really cops out there who are wise cracking , gum popping , grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner ? this probably played well back before the wheel was invented , but it is so corny and unbelievable today . catch the manic drum break by elisha cook ; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording . his mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync .
this is a classic british comedy-thriller i had always wanted to check out but no opportunity had arisen for that until now . it 's based on a popular stage play which had already been filmed a number of times previously ( most notably in 1931 by the same director but , unfortunately , this version seems not to have survived in its entirety ! ) ; for the remake under review , the plot has been updated to the then-current wartime situation . anyway , i was mainly familiar with early british comedians through the films of will hay : given that this one features a similar plot of legendary hauntings , smuggling and enemy agents , it 's very much in that vein ( it was actually scripted by hay 's regular writing team of marriott edgar , val guest and j.o.c . orton ) ; the stranded travelers element , then , was an equally tried-and-true formula . the star this time around is arthur askey ( abetted by richard murdoch ) - none of whose films i had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating ... but one soon warms up to him , and askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play ( and the 1931 film version ) was split into two here , with murdoch acting as the star 's straight partner . the remote single setting ( the events of the film largely take place during one stormy night ) provides for some wonderful atmosphere ; the last half-hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple ( raymond huntley and linden travers ) and eventually the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is especially gripping and well handled . also worth mentioning from the remaining cast list is kathleen harrison as the stereotypical frightened spinster , with a parrot as her constant companion and who is driven by all the excitement to take her very first drink .
after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat , serling continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight zone ' in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode . 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine ' is one of the more understated episodes , focusing on an aging movie star 's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes . because of this approach , the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story . both the leads , ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent , shine in their performances . the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing . lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly . fortunately , lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past . it 's a situation most can sympathise with , and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character . she is a prima-donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her , such as the disastrously withered co-star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were . it is somewhat surprising , then , that she is rewarded with a happy ending . it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre-empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen . what is not clear at the beginning , however , is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment . as it turns out , trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for , a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be . 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine ' gets better with each viewing . the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past , even though we can never return . except in the twilight zone .
the mother is one of those films that you know is good , maybe even great , but it is like eating vegetables or doing math homework is to a kid - too much work and a whole lot of pain to get invested in . the story is potentially distasteful in many ways : the death of a character within the first half hour , the december-may romance , the idea of a man cheating on his wife and then cheating on his lover with her mother , the collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters , the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives . this movie was made in the 2002 or 2003 , but is a throw back to a collection of british ( usually made-for-tv ) movies from the late 1980 's - it has a moral severity that never lets up , which produces an enveloping throbbing angst . the mother is flawless , but that is in part the problem ; if a film dealing with so many sensitive issues has some flaws - inconsistencies of script , some lesser actors - it takes the edge off , but if such a film is so pitch perfect , the experience of watching it is raw and painful . even the technical qualities - lighting , editing , etc . - make the viewer ache ; the london in this movie is bright and open , filled with harsh , cutting light . if you are tough as nails , or are one of those super-sensitive people who likes to torture themselves with gut-wrenching sad movies or novels , then you will enjoy the mother . anyone in between , give it a miss , or be prepared to squirm . and be warned : as tough as the movie is from beginning to near-end , the worst is to come . toward the end of the movie , the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make up for it ( for having slept with her boyfriend ) , and the daughter calmly says that she has thought about it and would like to hit her . the mother agrees to this , they both stand up , and - instead of a well primed slap - the daughter clenches her fist and delivers a boxer 's blow . argh ! ! !
i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors . i like raptors because they are scary . my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana . i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it 's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it 's got a good ending even though i did n't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that 's the important part . the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you 're watching it the first time . this is best movie .
this movie is perfect for families to watch together . it is a great film and it deserves more credit . the special effects are stunning and spectacular . everyone who has children should share this with theirs .
hal hartley 's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work . it has immense character depth , subtle , complicated dialogue , and an excellent , emotional ending which captivates . i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling . henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish , and needed no sequel . thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim . fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real-world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures . in her own movie , fay matures herself , though her maturity takes a very different road . simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat-introverted genius . fay starts her adult journey as an immature , utterly normal , spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature , utterly normal , experienced adult who holds no advantages . she deals with problems the way any human does , with determination , a little thought , and weary disdain . while simon learned to control his mind , fay learns to control her emotion . the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel , but differs vastly in tone for most of the film . henry fool showed you a harsh , boring , ignorant world which contrasted with simon 's inner passion and creativity . in fay grim , the world is a lively , crazy , emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life , and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother . the movie is in two parts , the first dealing with the beginning of fay 's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility , and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry . at first , fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel , and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy . but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies . the sequel is about fay 's journey , and as i said before , hers is one of finding the life-giving sanity in chaos , not the creative chaos in staid order . parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley 's tongue in cheek humor perfectly . elina löwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role , allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively , stage-like comedy happening around her . with the entrance of henry into the picture , the movie begins to take a sobering turn . hal hartley 's movies are all plays , and every play must come full circle . by the end , you are shown fay 's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry , whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets . fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool , but shows through hal 's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius . honestly , i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile ( and especially the subtlety in parker posey 's acting ) , but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool .
a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way . cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential . a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind . in one of the compartments he meets with a girl . words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations . the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words .
bette davis ' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players . they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers - they just did n't have as much to do . some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better - it was but to give the film it 's due , to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat . the first part of the book did n't even make it to the screen - it told of phillip 's childhood , then moved to germany and paris , where phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist . it also chronicles his first romance - with fanny price , who kills herself when she realises phillip can not return her feelings of love . it is a wonderful book but rambling and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is . after realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter , phillip carey ( leslie howard ) comes back to england hoping to take up medicine . when out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress , mildred ( bette davis ) . even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt , phillip is obsessed . it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew . in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room , when they almost miss each other , she berates him with `` why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available '' . you just want to shake him . the only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man , a coarse sales- man , emile miller ( alan hale ) . with mildred out of the picture , he meets nora ( kay johnson ) a lovely woman , who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym . she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants ( in the novel he had seen mildred reading them . ) nora gives phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love . when mildred returns ( miller did n't marry her and she is having a baby ) , of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby ( in the film it is treated as an object - always called `` baby '' , never given a name or gender ) - she repays him by running off with his best friend . at the hospital he meets sally athelny ( frances dee ) who is visiting her sick father . he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family . then surprise ! surprise ! mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise ! philip takes her in . but he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how . then follows one of the most vicious , verbal fights on film with phrases such as `` you cad , you dirty swine '' , `` i only kissed you because you begged me '' and `` when you went i wiped my mouth , i wiped my mouth '' ! ! ! in the book a lot of mildred 's stock phrases such as `` you 're a gentleman in every sense of the word '' , `` i do n't mind '' , and `` mr. high and mighty '' were associated with prostitutes and when phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that . the end of the film shows phillip ( being truly free of mildred in the only way possible ) now free to love sally . again in the book sally tells phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love . that ending , like mildred 's `` sickness '' could not be in the film - even a pre-code one . kay johnson was always called on to play sensible , believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself . her nora was the woman philip should have stayed with . frances dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues . she was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face ( `` the silver cord '' and `` blood money '' ) but when she married joel mccrea her career started to peter out . her sally did not push her talent to the limits . apparently leslie howard was not very helpful to bette davis on the set - he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part . he used to throw her her lines `` whilst reading a book off camera '' . he did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported `` the kid was running away with the picture '' ! ! ! highly , highly recommended .
greetings again from the darkness . what a relief ... a thriller that actually is thrilling ! new `` it '' girl rachel mcadams ( `` wedding crashers '' and `` the notebook '' ) dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director wes craven ( `` scream '' movies and `` a nightmare on elm street '' ) . craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane . what makes this one work , is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes as we see mcadams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone . she is a natural . when she meets cillian murphy ( the scarecrow in `` batman begins '' ) in what appears to be happenstance , the film really takes flight . watching the two yuppie-types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing , is bewitching film-making ! the plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic . craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue . as with many thrillers , the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero . an interesting plot device leads us to believe little rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through , but we ca n't help but cringe a bit . the most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests , an annoying airline passenger , cillian 's injury and the fx at the hotel . the strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads . sadly the fine screen veteran brian cox is under-utilized , but overall this is an above-average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale .
i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea . i think the `` dark-heart '' character is a little on the rough side and i do n't like the way he shape-shifts into a `` mean '' frog , fox , boy i was wrong , this movie was made for my kid , not for me . she `` gets it '' when it went over ( under ? ) my head . of course i do n't `` get it '' . this is n't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy . this is straight for the young ones , and the crew knew what they were doing . there is n't any political junk ether . there 's no magic key that will save the world from ourselves , nobody has the right to access excess , and everyone is n't happy all the time . and as a side benefit , nobody dies ! russwill .
pretty good film from preminger ; labyrinthine at times , as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live . in this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying , as its hero , a good cop with a bad temper , gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head . dana andrews plays the lead as if it were hamlet , and has never been better . the story may be pure melodrama but andrews gives it weight , and almost raises it to the level of tragedy . as his girl , gene tierney is attractive but unremarkable . gary merrill makes for a very interesting villain , with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to andrews ' coolness ; his smiling , amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open , as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him . there are no major surprises in this film , which seems transitional for all concerned . for director preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his laura stars , andrews and tierney , who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made . the supporting cast , -- merrill , karl malden , neville brand -- are , understandably , more optimistic , as they were all on their way up . preminger , as serene an observer as ever , lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view , as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing , for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain , much less resolve .
this was basically an attempt to do the same thing with `` batman '' that was done with `` gilligan 's island '' in `` surviving gilligan 's island . '' for those of you who missed it ( and shame ! ) `` surviving gilligan 's island '' ( full title : `` surviving gilligan 's island : the incredibly true story of the longest three hour tour in history '' ) was a special from a few years back , where bob denver ( `` gilligan '' ) , dawn wells ( `` mary ann '' ) and russell johnson ( `` the professor '' ) related the story of the show 's creation , cancellation , rediscovery & rebirth . along the way , stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew . it was very well done . it was funny , well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show . `` return to the batcave : the misadventures of adam and burt '' is in a similar style . the re-telling of the history of the show , the re-enactments , the general feel are all the same . what 's missing is the straightforward approach that `` surviving '' took . in `` return '' , adam west and burt ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited . after being allowed to stay , adam and burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show : the legendary batmobile ! adam and burt decide to chase after it themselves , leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show . this eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the batmobile and why . choosing to use this conceit ( actually having a plot ) is the biggest letdown of this show . unlike `` surviving '' , `` return '' forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline ( the theft of the batmobile ) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in ( the history of the show . ) it is the historical sections that work the best . the casting ( as in `` surviving '' ) is excellent . jack brewer ( `` adam west '' ) and jason marsden ( `` burt ward '' ) capture the feel of the actors without looking * too * much like them . brett rickaby ( `` frank gorshin '' ) bears a stronger resemblance to his subject , but captures none of the late gorshin 's charm , only his characterizations . other actors ' portrayals are short and functional , with none standing out as especially good or bad . many of the stories have been told before , but they mostly play out amusingly , with only the occasional clunky presentation . another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of lyle waggoner 's tryout for the part of batman . the only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story . this downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly . the `` main plot '' ( if that is what we must call it ) is , of course , ludicrous . this is not really a fault in and of itself , but it 's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall . strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot ( especially in these kinds of things ) but we really get neither , here . the performances by west and ward seem somewhat flat ( even for them ) ; the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural . again , i think the comparison to `` surviving gilligan 's island '' can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback . in `` surviving '' , that 's all it intends to be . in `` return '' it tries to do double duty and , unfortunately , often fails . gorshin and newmar do well ( although i agree with others that gorshin had not aged well and that newmar had - and what 's waggoner taking to look that good ? ) but are n't given enough to do . again , i think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here . another odd point about `` return '' . this special is about the `` batman '' tv series and its history , yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie . even the waggoner footage is technically movie footage . if you know you 're `` bat-history '' , then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first , only to be delayed in favor of the tv show when cbs needed to fill time fast . so when waggoner and west were testing for the role , it was for the movie , not the tv show . why `` return '' only uses movie footage is unclear . it most probably has to do with rights issues , but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know : seeing julie newmar in the present , but only footage of lee meriwether as catwoman in the past . overall , i liked the show , mainly for the flashbacks . i would have preferred the style used in `` surviving gilligan 's island '' , but i can understand why they 'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter . besides , i like these people . it 's nice to see them out and about , still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history . i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there .
the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv . it 's actually not long enough , in a way . all of the major bases in the decades are covered , and they 're all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides . but it almost does n't cover enough , or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time . for example , the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs ( partly the marijuana , later cocaine ) is really well presented , but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover . overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs , pop-culture , government intervention , the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia , all felt the wave of various drugs over the years , and the interplay between all was very evident . nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot ) - goes to endorse drugs outright , but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun , and then tragic , about taking certain drugs . the appearances of various staunch , ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and america 's connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees . the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not 'just say no ' , because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought . it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them ( as , for example , oxycontin continues on in the marketplace ) . is it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary ? no , but for some summertime tv viewing for the young ( i.e . my age ) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago , as well as for the 'old ' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks , careless times , and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it . there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased , which is not totally untrue , but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social , political , and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving ( for better or obvious worse ) for enough of a fascinating view .
i liked timothy dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for mr r. but i thought zelah clarke too plump and short . this version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed . i have seen 4 versions , orson welles is still my favorite mr r , though george c scott did very well and it 's a toss up between joan fontaine and sussanah york , although they were both a bit too old for the role . i recently saw a brilliant tv version of rebecca with charles dance and emilia fox . i would love to see those two do jane eyre.by the time i got to watching the ciarin hinds version , i think i was jane eyred out , but i will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing joan fontaine 's voice narrate the opening of the first version i ever saw . i always want to go back and read the book again .
the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group . in their endeavors , the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin , whom sister goes after because she believes he is the `` big time '' who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life . though he could be accused of killing her , he really kills only her spirit and will to live , after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose . the story is n't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off , then threatens him , it 's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be `` discovered '' back then .
first off , if you 're planning on watching this , make sure to watch the uncut version ( although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship ) , it makes a huge difference . this film is about a young woman , played by barbara stanwyck , who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father . when her father suddenly passes away , she is able to go out into the world on her own . after reading about nietzsche 's philosophies on life , she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love . throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all . overall , baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film . while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen , it is very obvious what is happening off camera . i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it , especially with the films shock value . i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts , but i think that about most movies the first time is see them . actually , i think that almost all movies i 've seen made from the early 30 's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just did n't quite `` flow '' right . this was probably just the craft of film-making was n't quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years . compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30 's film and i think you 'll see what i mean . once again , i 'm very glad i was able to watch the original cut ; it really does make a big difference . also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role .
undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the tired genre of first person shoot em ups . it tells the story of patrick galloway an expert of the occult and a formidable fighter who is summoned by a friend to his estate in ireland to investigate some weird phainomena . the game is set in ireland after world war one so do n't expect to find weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers.all the weapons in the game can be considered antiques but the real fun in the game are its spells and the system they operate on.our hero is ambidexterous so he can use both his hands at the same time : he casts spells with his right arm and uses his guns with the left.so you can shoot and cast spells at the same time which as you understand very fun and also unique to this game ! the graphics are great and they can run very well on a medium power p.c .. level design is also cool and atmospheric . mostly the game revolves around the covenant estate and the mansion but there are many other locations waiting to be discovered as you progress . thanks to the talent of clyve barker the game has an excelent storyline and plot ( something very rare for a first person shooter ) and i said before a great and very spooky atmosphere the voice acting is also good but not excellent . but the game has two main flaws . first of all it is quite linear so when your mission says for example go to that room all the doors in the house will be locked apart from those that lead to the room of your mission this may save time but it restricts your liberty of exploration.secondly the fact all the weapons are antiques may not appeal to most fps players who are used to high tech weaponry . as far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced . most of it is of medium difficulty but sometimes it gets more difficult but not frustratingly difficult . overall undying is a great game . definitely one of the best fps out there .
this is a gory mess and pretty convincing . corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner . linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her , the little `` tryst '' with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - shame about that pretty smile ! the last half hour of the movie is devoted to bernson 's character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne . an extremely talented performer , she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off . nice legs , too !
orson welles ' `` the lady from shanghai '' does not have the brilliant screenplay of `` citizen kane , '' e.g. , but charles lawton , jr. 's cinematography , the unforgettable set pieces ( such as the scene in the aquarium , the seagoing scene featuring a stunning , blonde-tressed rita hayworth singing `` please do n't love me , '' and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax ) , and the wonderful cast ( everett sloane in his greatest performance , welles in a beautifully under-played role , the afore-mentioned miss hayworth -- welles ' wife at the time -- at her most gorgeous ) make for a very memorable filmgoing experience . the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling , not inscrutable at all . the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns , and welles ' closing line is an unheralded classic . `` the lady from shanghai '' gets four stars from this impartial arbiter .
i would just like all of the fans of this documentary to know that martin torgoff is my uncle and i am so darn proud of him . this mini-series that in shown on vh1 is a great look at the culture of drugs in the past 30 years and my uncle worked very hard on it . the amount of time and effort that i have watched him put into this documentary and the book that started it all ( ca n't find my way home ) makes it that much better to watch him on tv . i know that he loves what he does and he does it well . his eloquence is shown in the interviews , which he did himself , and the amazing additions that he himself adds to the commentary . from the music to the videos and everything in between , this is a great documentary that really shows the experience of the drug culture through the eyes of someone who lived through it . i appreciate any comments on this from those who enjoyed it ( or did n't ) and would love to hear from fans ! three cheers for uncle martin ! ! !
this is far more than the charming story of middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing ( although it is that as well ) . it 's the tale of one person learning to love life again , pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more . the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact . there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud ... a few where you 'll want to get up and tango ... and many others where you 'll just feel good . this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are `` heavy '' and inaccessible .
i remember hitch hiking to spain at 25 , getting a lift from , what turned out to be , two fleeing italian small crooks . they were doing a lot outside the law , but from the other side carrying a little portrait of jesus in the pocket for their protection ... just and unjust , good and bad , criminal and correct where here in a new combination , outside of the categories i used to know . 'les valseuses ' gives me , although a film and not real life , a picture close to my own experiences : the intenseness of each moment as soon as you leave 'all behind ' and go for the momentous , whatever comes your way , it 's another state of mind and also 'dangerous ' form of life , because , as we all know , there are people who are not ready for this and willing to persecute you for 'stealing ' and so on ... this film touches 'values ' , it 's a story about 'what 's right and wrong ' : morals . it 's resurrection of the individual fighting him/ herself free against the 'false morals ' and conformism ... there 's danger all the way , because , how far can you go with your own 'freedom ' and crossing your own moral borders and that of other people ? what to do with people who are willing to hurt you , put you in jail or even shoot at you for the things that you do , like `` stealing '' some petrol from a multinational oil company for you fifth hand car ? les valseuses re-awakens these questions in me , because morality , in contradiction to the usual 'media message ' , is quite complex ...
this film is excellently paced , you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there 's much more going on than the initial premise of the film . throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies . do n't let anyone tell you that they 're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities ; - sure , there 's plenty of that but it 's all contextual , not gratuitous . i loved this film and it only cost me £2.99 on dvd , so in terms of entertainment value for money , it has been the best film i 've seen this year .
has al pacino ever been in a bad movie ? his name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema . this is as good a performance as he 's ever given . pacino is an american olivier . and this is a political thriller as good as they get . there are no good guys and no bad guys . but the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they 're running it . not only is pacino 's performance compelling -- - the eulogy at the dead child 's funeral is awesomely powerful -- - the film has a fast paced , gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks . this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence , overheated sex or gutter language . there is murder . there are bad people . but they come across effectively without crossing the line . a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood . i do n't award many tens . this one richly deserves it !
the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist ' plot made this a real knock out for me . the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping . there was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by lensky 's heart-wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin . for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium , which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film . krisana is in the same mould .
in the film `` brokedown palace , '' directed by jonathan kaplan , two best friends , alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii , but hear that bangkok , thailand , is much more fun . they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans . while they were in thailand , alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks ( daniel lapaine ) . he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong . they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs . they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison . i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever . also , a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face . those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever . things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made . sometimes life is not fair , that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made . this movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand . this film also has great music ; a few of my favorite songs are 'silence ' by delerium , 'damaged ' by plumb , 'deliver me ' by sarah bightman and 'party 's just begun ' by nelly furtado . i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film . these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly , a mistake that anyone could make , therefore this film is good for any audience . it makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes . even though , i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of -- who really smuggled the drugs ? -- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up .
i have been looking for this movie for so many years . i saw this move when i was nine and loved this movie . i called disney all the movie stores and the net . no luck . what a waste it was a very good movie . it will be missed : (
this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice . the directing and editing was great . i may look up the book that this was adapted from , it must have been great . ( i liked it . ) sigourney weaver , jon voight , and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch ! henry winkler and nathan davis were not seen enough , but were fun when they were onscreen . the kids at the camp could n't have been better . ( as i said , i liked it ! )
shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage . but when this stage is israel the work that we interpret multiplies for ten and all the actions we do are full of a hard style . dan katzir manages to do a spectacular portrait of a part of life in tel aviv , but besides , katzir manages to penetrate into the heart of the israeli people and , this people , far from being simple prominent figures , they speak to us from the heart . katzir 's film allows israel escape from dark informative crux in which they live , and this wonderful country arises to the light as a splendid bird which is born of his ashes . it is very great for me because the reality of state of israel , which the europeans only know for the informative diaries or the newspapers , appears as a close and absolutly human reality , the reality of million people who looking for his place , exploring the whole state , the whole culture with the only aim to feel part of it . katzir constructs an absolutely wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man films with passion the deepest feelings are projected with force , and these feelings cross our hearts . thank you dan for open our eyes and give us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries of the world .
savaged when it came out , this film now looks handsome and sounds great . a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting , from gielgud , kenneth haigh , harry andrews and especially anton walbrook , and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean seberg . preminger does n't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect , and graham greene 's script condenses shaw without sacrificing complexity.the piece has the look of a made for tv movie , and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that . too many contemporary movies on 'historical ' themes can not resist dumbing down . what would mel gibson have made of the maid ? many drooling shots of her on the rack probably , then crisping up on the bbq as the flames take hold . preminger does none of this . the burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction . there are a few weak performances , but not enough to cause any serious damage . i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through , but i was gripped . in our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice , joan 's story has unexpected resonance .
scoop * * * out of * * * * woody allen is definitely not my favorite director , but i enjoyed `` match point . '' it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen . it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in it . `` scoop '' is woody allen 's latest film and though he appears in this one , it 's ok . it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect together . johansson plays sondra pransky , a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe strombel ( ian mcshane . ) joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the reaper has taken . one of those souls is the secretary of peter lyman ( hugh jackman . ) she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of england . joe , with the scoop of a life time , travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra , during a magic act . sondra is at some magic show with magician sid waterman ( woody allen . ) she becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box , she gets the visit from joe . not knowing what to do , she enlists the help of sid waterman to help her crack the case . this film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to `` match point '' and yet it all works . johansson and allen work great together . allen 's humor fits perfect for this story and role . hugh jackman is terrific as peter layman , the `` suspected '' serial killer . this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch . the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself . i say give it a chance because you just might like it .
a hilarious neil simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end . the late walter matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner ( the late oscar-winner george burns ) for a final reunion show on stage . benjamin martin is matthau 's agent and nephew , and the two have just as much chemistry as matthau and burns . i love matthau 's grumpy character -- he 's just the same as he always is , and yet also very different . burns , as the absent-minded old man , is just as funny as matthau . matthau : want some crackers ? i 've got coconut , pineapple and graham . burns : how about a plain cracker ? matthau : i do n't got plain . i got coconut , pineapple and graham . burns : okay matthau : they 're in the cupboard in the kitchen . burns : maybe later . or how about this : matthau : when i did black , the whites knew what i was saying ! you 've got to see it in the movie to understand it ! all in all , a refreshingly hilarious , sweet , heartfelt , warm , belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time . they just do n't make them like this anymore ! in a time when all the newest comedies are crude , juvenile and stupid , this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is -- funny characters , smart and funny dialogue , and grand entertainment . one of the best buddy comedies of all time , right up there with `` planes , trains and automobiles , '' `` lethal weapon , '' and `` the hard way . '' you may have a hard time finding this for rent or on tv , but trust me , it will be worth your time ! 4.5/5 stars . - john ulmer
this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series . it has a `` down to earth '' -kind of feel with darker and less `` plaggy '' scenography . the characters need some more time to develop but they have potential . one thing that is fairly disappointing ( with all star trek series really ) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else . ( earth has stopped war , famine etc ) the female characters here are two , subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human . hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a `` vulcan babe '' . some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american ( as opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew ) but creates interesting dynamics . a very good pilot though for a very good series .
this is a film .. , not porn . this is a wonderful film ! ! ! full of tender moments and memories ! ! a beautiful piece of work ! ! ! excellent ! ! ! for intelligent , viewers only ! ! ! if you are a film lover . a romantic . a person who has loved deeply , this is your film ! ! ! ! it has a beautiful surreal quality . fine acting and directing . watching this film made me remember my first love . thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life , love and the meaning of loss . highly recommended for all film lovers .
back when musicals were n't showcases for choreographers , we had wonderful movies such as this one . being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie . not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood , but close enough . some of the american vaudeville humour , the slapstick not the witty banter , clash with wodehouse 's british sense of humour . but on the whole , the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricatures . some inventive staging for the dance numbers , including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors , more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number . they seem a lot more realistic , if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realistic . the lack of ginger rogers and eric blore do n't hurt the movie , instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge . it 's also nice not to have a wise cracking , headstrong love interest . instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest , far more in keeping with wodehouses ' young aristocratic females .
i saw this many years after the television series and , initially , i did n't care for it . then , as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time , i watched again , and found it absolutely hilarious . based on the stage play by neil simon , it has not been 'opened out ' much for the big screen , and that 's one of its strengths . walter matthau and jack lemmon are brilliant as oscar and felix , and the supporting cast are wonderful , particularly john fielder as 'vinnie ' . even now , certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - felix interrupting oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request , oscar cracking up and chasing felix around the apartment , the giggling 'pigeon sisters ' brought low by felix 's sob stories , and of course , the legendary cafeteria scene ( later ripped off by nora ephron 's 'when harry met sally ' ) . razor-sharp dialogue too . when the boys think felix has taken an overdose , oscar says : `` they could be vitamins ! he could be the healthiest one in the room ! '' . fantastic !
okay , so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way , but from the beginning , hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances , and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made . they advice people to see newer episodes first , so they can see just how good the show is , and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes . the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on-screen . the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show , as the story lines go from strength to strength . the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines - depression , drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way , but that is what star trek is and was all about . it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way , dealing with them subtly and smoothly . yes , they have used some characters from trek history , but they have done them justice - characters like shelby , lefler and necheyev , vastly underused in the show , had a rebirth in the new frontier books , but they lost their sizzle after a while , when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci-fi , and hf shows those characters in a completely different light , which serves them better . the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved . they release bloopers for every episode , so the fans can see what a laugh they have , because they are people doing it in their spare time , with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide-eyed in shock ! what this series , now drawing to a close after 7 years , has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing - bringing people together , inspiring others to do the same . hf will live for a long time after it ends , as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place .
for anyone with a moderate sensibility , a moderate feeling of the human and humane condition , for anyone capable of getting above the hollywood ilk , for anyone who is satisfied seeing cinema which does not have a series of seagals/willis/van dammes blasting the brains out of anybody or seeing who gets into bed with whom , for anyone whose intellectual level reaches a capacity to grasp , sympathise with , comprehend , laugh with , cry with natural tender heart-warming hilarious compassionate human beings , ` le huitième jour ' is waiting for you . jaco van dormael has not achieved simply a masterpiece , that would have been too simplistic ; he has achieved one of those rare monumental works of art in the cinematographic world which defies any kind of encapsuling . is it a drama ? is it a comedy ? no : it is the story of georges , a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality , a sufferer of the downes syndrome . it is a story which has you laughing through your tears , but this is not one of those classic tear-jerkers ; this film moves through a world that has you at once mixing your feelings of compassion or pity or even shame with those of admiration , warmth and even love . a successful banking salesman , harry , bumps into georges : they were both going in opposite directions with absolutely opposing ideas , problems and priorities ; skillfully van dormael melts these two unlikely men into a warm friendship , but which is so much more than the good buddy friendship of those having a beer down the road . this is a relationship which develops into a profound needing by both for the other . the cuasi-surrealist scenes fit in perfectly : georges recalls ( or invents ) past scenes of his life while either day-dreaming or sleeping ; even the almost phantasmagorical final scene is totally correct . the only scene which might be considered a little out of place is when they steal a bus and drive it out of the show-rooms . however , this does not detract from the whole . this film is a monument . even if your french is not up to much , please bear seeing it with sub-titles . ` le huitième jour ' is worth the trouble . as for anything else , well , just read the following commentaries  i go along with all of them . this film is a joy , it is majestic , it is unique . if you have seen ` rain man ' which i consider an excellent film , you must see this one : it is far superior because it has not the superficial veneer of famous hollywood-produced world-renowned actors ; it has pascal duquenne and daniel auteuil  ten oscars for these two , and three more for jaco van dormael . who cares ? yes : 11 out of 10 if the imdb rating does n't break down under the strain . magnifique ! chapeau !
the story is being told fluidly . there are no interruptions . the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly . casting was superb . young ya'ara looked very much like ya'ara would have looked at that age . her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly . director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story . the cinematography is very good . you feel like you are with ya'ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff . the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely . it is interesting to note that even though `` out of sight '' is not a direct translation of `` lemarit ayin '' both names are very appropriate to the story .
i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of michelle 's movies , i thought she had a bleak future in this business.i was extremely wrong after watching her performance in `` girlfight '' i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter , but also a warrior.in this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother , the way she conveys anger when getting hit.her characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love , or that just because she has power she wont win.i believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience , the director saw talent , i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her .
branagh and fishburne deliver excellent performances in this version of the shakespeare classic . branagh plays iago better than i 've seen the character played in film or on stage . some might say this film is overly iago-centric , but i disagree . fishburne , the first black othello in film history ironically , delivers a powerful performance . fishburne has always been a good actor , but this performance as the moor of venice may be one of his best . the one problem i have with this film , is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes . desdemona 's character is given far less depth than she has in the play . in this film , she might as well not be added at all . one of the worst cuts made by branagh in this film , was the subtraction of a conversation between iago and desdemona at the beginning of the second act . this part of the play shows that desdemona may not be the innocent child she is portrayed as in this film . there were a number of subtractions that hurt the integrity of this film . however , if you have not read the play , or seen a film version of othello before , i recommend this movie . the story , cut or not , is still incredibly enthralling . the acting , as stated previously , is very good . if some important scenes had been added , and desdemona 's character been prioritized a bit further , this would be a great movie . as it stands , it 's still an admirable version of the original . i give it a marginal recommendation .
girlfight is like your grandmother 's cooking : same old recipe you 've tried a million times before , yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new . try and explain the story to people who have n't seen it before : a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter , obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival . watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés , and they 're right : it * is * clichéd . yet i was hypnotized by how well this film works , due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue , and sensitive direction that makes it 'new ' . i avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but do n't make the same mistake i did . definiately worth a look .
yeah , the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie . the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it . that 's just brilliant . joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life . the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating . a very nice family movie with - i concede - a rather corny happy end . but hey , it does n't really matter , the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes .
after some of the negative reviews i heard on this movie , i was doubtful of giving it a go , but i had £3.99 in my wallet & thought id gamble on buying a budget like movie & saw this and gave it ago & i 'm glad i did , i enjoyed it . directed by the star of films such as chain reaction , the ring , bourne identity , ( brian cox ) i had to gamble with this even if it was rubbish but it were n't at all , i found some of the humour quite funny especially alfred molina the star of spider-man 2 the character doc ock . he was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film . of course like many other people which bought this movie i saw matthew 's name , and that made me get it ! and no his part is n't big at all , it 's very short at the very end of the film , it 's not a big part which makes me believe thats why people hate the film . i suggest you give it a go . some parts are a pit poor that needed polishing , the acting , and a bit more action . but it 's watchable .
tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid . i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got . my favorite one was `` the red sea sharks '' - so much action and humor . this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin . the film-maker 's personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving . a great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist . a great example of someone who has become internationally renown , and has brought joy of millions of children ( and the young at heart ) all over the world .
musings : pure delight from beginning to end . not a laugh riot , but a more subtle , sophisticated humor . what a goldmine of great scenes and character actors , including reginald denny , nestor paiva , ian wolfe , harry shannon and jason robards sr .. cary grant is at the building sight of his new home , which is at that point , being framed . a young carpenter , played by future tarzan lex barker , asks him if he wants his `` lallies to be rabbeted '' , or some such thing that only a carpenter would know . grant , not wanting to appear ignorant , replies in the affirmative . at that , barker yells up to his mates , `` ok boys , he wants 'em rabbeted , so .... yank 'em out ! '' a second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards . all grant can do is moan . yes , the movie is dated . you 'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home , and a place like that , in connecticut of all places , would probably run a few million bucks . a classic movie that is really a treasure .
this movie is not porn , it was not meant to be porn , and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn . now that that issue was sorted out , i can say i thoroughly recommend this film , as it 's issues are still widely available . it 's funny , the acting is great and it raises serious ( curious ) questions . i ca n't fully understand why this film was so mistreated , probably this is why i plan to never visit the us . lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement , confusion , curiosity and wit are her main attributes , she is occasionally angry , but are n't we all ?
wow ! all i can say is that if elizabeth montgomery is the enemy ( she speaks russian ) , then i 'm surrendering right now . in her short skirt , high-top boots , and pronounced bust line , she 's a real babe , even if her zombie-like eye-shadow sort of comes and goes . this 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series . note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with bronson until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin , ruining all the fun . okay , probably i should leave off my hormonal response . this is a very well produced half-hour by that underrated force behind the series 's success , buck houghton . naturally , the producers want to lead off the third season with an above average entry . it 's post nuclear-holocaust america ( we know because she 's part of the invading force ) and only american bronson and soviet montgomery are left , along with about twenty tons of realistic wreckage . they wander among the destruction in alternating moods , while we wonder how long it will take for biology to trump politics , which of course it eventually does , ( lucky bronson ) . and that 's about it . no real talk , except for what bronson has to say which is pretty overblown . nonetheless , the screenplay is still entertaining , and rather daring for its time , even suggesting that not all russian women looked like truck drivers ( a popular cold war stereotype of the time ) . in passing -- it 's rather curious that the very slavic-looking bronson ( buchinsky ) would be cast as the american and the glossy-looking montgomery as the slav . appearance-wise , it should be the reverse . my guess is that the producers did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female , regardless of appearances . however that may be , there is little of the usual tz fright or atmosphere , still the episode remains a very , very watchable 30 minutes .
hard to categorize the film - perhaps it 's an avant garde spy thriller ? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel , and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film . the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book . the `` indie '' approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it . these days , i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses . and normally that is too bad , but not in this case . mother night has tight direction and a solid cast . nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older , still has that `` everyman '' persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters . sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always . i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry . i guess making your debut as a dead girl ( twin peaks ) with little air time is n't the choicest of roles , even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon . anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you do n't have to read the book to understand the movie . in fact , given today 's geopolitical realities , the novel 's premise may appear dated , and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding ( i am talking to you , fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography , history , and lord knows what other subjects ! ) .
`` the mother '' tells of a recently widowed mid-60 's mother of two adult children ( reid ) who , on the heels of her husband 's death , finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her daughter 's married lover . the film dwells on the quietly passive mom , her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter , the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover , and the convolutions arising therefrom . a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents , `` the mother '' does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism . will play best with more mature audiences , possibly women , who may better empathize with the central character , her needs and issues .

h.g . wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in 1935.very well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for decades.great cast includes ; raymond massey ( arsenic and old lace ) sir cedric hardwick ( ghost of frankenstein ) ralph richardson ( time bandits ) and margaretta scott.early glimpses of helicopters , holograms , a rocket ship , and futuristic cities.this film was ahead of its time.directed by william cameron menzies ( invaders from mars ) its very enjoyable much like the earlier movie metropolis ( 1927 ) but avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to come , that was made in 1979. this movie has nothing to do with the original.h.g . wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his stories.a classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10
i am surprised at imdb 's low rating of this movie . with all due respect , its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor . they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills , a bigger budget , and more gore . the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . it is not , nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one . it is a psychological thriller . it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . reel.com 's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie . all the other negative reviews does n't make much sense . it 's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- is something bad and not worth it . i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and did n't make sense . martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning . the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing , we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film 's direction and writing . i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 's range on originality alone . i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale- aka smart people- since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy 's nightmare . kudos to the acting as well . for such a low budget film , you are amazed that this movie did n't hit your local cinema with the great direction , writing , and acting . please do n't be fooled by the rating by imdb . this movie is worth it . i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .
this is the first michael vartan movie i 've seen-i have n't seen alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.he sure can and is likable in this movie.natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles , so i found her very good and lovable in this different '' sweet '' role of a schoolteacher . some of the negative comments i read are true , the movie is full of clichés and the story does n't ring true at all.also , even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together , i do n't think there is screen chemistry there . however , i enjoyed this movie.the locales are nice , the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good . if you are expecting to see a great romance , this is not it.but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good .
i have just managed to get hold of the celestial region 3 dvd of the five venoms and what a super job they have made of it . a fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any kung fu fan . the story is pretty straight forward , and has been mentioned already so i wo n't go into it again . needless to say it 's the fight scenes that many buy the movie for , and they do not disappoint . only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed . bruce lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time ! all kicks and punches come with the all important `` type writer '' clicks and air `` whooshes '' , which is a cool effect though quite amusing ! i give this movie a b+ . good but not great . in a way i feel it could have been that bit better . golden swallow , by the same director a decade earlier , had as good a story and better action .
my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie ( passing them down in the family if you will ) , and i loved it . clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it 's up to superman to stop this mayhem . it 's just so wonderful and fun to view . the old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology . george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid , and i 'm 16 now , it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are .
leave it to braik to put on a good show . finally he and zorak are living their own lives outside of spac ghost coast to coast . i have to say that i love both of these shows a whole lot . they are completely what started adult swim . brak made it big with an album that came out in the year 2000 . it may not have been platinum , but his show was really popular to tons of people out there that love adult swims shows . i have to say that out of all the adult swim shows with no plot , this has to be the one with the most none plot ever made . that is why i like it so much , it is just such a classic in the adult swim history . i believe this is just such a great show , if you do n't like it . hey there were tons who hated it and tons who loved it .
earth ( 2009 ) * * * 1/2 big screen adaptation of the bbc/discovery channel series `` planet earth '' offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of `` how the hell did they get this footage ? ! '' while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel ( witness a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal ! ) and adorable ( the various babies and their 'rents ) . the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its 'god 's eye views ' and profundity . culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage , the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could 've even gone longer ! oh , well , there 's always the next time ( since disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come ) . dirs : alastair fothergill & mark linfield .
the traditional western is synonymous with wide open spaces , clearcut morality , inevitable storylines , the optimistic faith in a hero 's ability to shape his own destiny , to escape his past . these qualities reflect directly the american sense of self , the self-shaping dream , the pushing of boundaries and frontiers , which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians . with some noble exceptions ( eg wellman , hawks ) , the western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety . anthony mann changed all that forever , and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent , vivid , complex , not to say exciting westerns ever made . the traditional western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged wholesomeness , whatever misfortunes he may have had in the past , a supporter of order and right , who dominates the film , removes its obstacles , restores harmony in effect ; and an obvious villain , who often , ironically , drives the plot , forces the hero into certain actions . the difference between the two is often delineated as mythically simple as the wearing of white or black hats . mann 's background was in film noir , a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism . noir was neurotically charged , focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist , where morality is blurred , the hero is as often the villain , trapped in an interior-labyrinth of his own making , a passive victim to destiny . noir is about regress not progress , the interrogating and denying of modes and signs of representation , not the creation and confirmation of them . winchester 73 is fraught with noir anxiety . noir is often considered a psychological genre , visualising the traumas of its protagonist 's head . 73 does this too , and is all the more disturbing in that that protagonist is lovely , homespun jimmy stewart , initiating here his great run of difficult films with mann and hitchcock . in many ways , good-natured and sweet , representing right and trying to restore disruptions to the natural order , he is also a near-lunatic who will stop at nothing to achieve murderous revenge , whose relentless quest mirrors ethan edwards in the searchers in its inhuman persistance , whose human instincts are frayed by this quest , and whose bursts of violence are genuinely terrifying to witness . as in noir , his anxiety has a psychological base - unlike most 'healthy ' heroes who have outgrown ( symbolically killed ) their fathers , mcadam 's father was killed before he could complete the process ; his chasing his brother is less moral revenge than an anguished protest against stunted growth . the climactic shoot-out is not cathartic : mcadam staggers back into 'normal ' society , like he 's just witnessed some of the world 's most ghastly horrors . what is most unsettling about the film is that it 's not really about a hero or a villain at all , but an inanimate piece of weoponry that drives the action . 73 opens with the gun of the title privileged , on display behind a glass window , while its admirers are trapped , squashed , undifferentiated , framed , admiring it outside . throughout the film , human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of signifiers - names change ; lin and dutch mime shooting each other because they 've no guns ; quests lose their moral vitality and their practitioners veer close to madness ; armies have to ask for help from confederate strangers to fight battles ; a man becomes worthy of respect only when he mentions his name ; another man is revealed as a coward when he abandons his fiancee to the indians ; the gun retains its prestige , power , wholeness . it 's not the revenge plot which drives the film , but the story of the gun ; this wrenches the film out of conventional expectations , and creates an eerie , alienating , modern feel . we become so caught up in the revenge plot that when we follow , with the gun , another plot entirely , we feel slightly bewildered . this emphasis on the gun , symbol of potent masculinity , actually allows for a critique of that masculinity , revealing pointless elaborate rituals at the expense of society and order ; brute capitalist greed ; murderous indian-traders who defraud both seller and enemy ; cowards ; psychotic killers ; before returning to its 'true ' owner , a broken hero thoroughly compromised , who has become as murderous as the murderer he seeks . the gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner , not only because there is no fixed owner , but because there is no fixed masculinity , an insight anathema to the traditional western . 73 brilliantly invokes western myths - wyatt earp , dodge city , the cavalry , the civil war , the wide open west - only to undermine them . earp has an inflated reputation that is all name but never proven - dodge city is no safer against outlaws than anywhere else ; the cavalry is inept ( custer has just lost little big horn ) and the bitter feud of the war is shown to be irrelevant . the myth of the open west is a site for a very closed , inescapable , circular plot which traps its characters , refuses to allow them shape their destiny , but allowing it to shape them . the old john ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is reprised , but signals here not progress but repetition and circularity . but for all its deconstruction , the film is also tangibly vivid in a way few westerns ever achieve . mann 's incisive technique intrudes his camera in crucial positions , alternating revealing distance with intense examination , making the saloon doors and stagecoaches seem thrillingly alive and lived in .
first it was jack the ripper , now it is alan feinstone . the crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways . quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical . especially from corbin bernson . in some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe .
this is a unique and bold film . it 's energetic , with highly developed characters . very good performances . i love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think ... bret carr dares to look inward , ask questions , and dig underneath the surface . by the nature of the film , it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well . it can take some courage to do this . i can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing . however , i found it thought-provoking , much more than just entertainment . bret carr is truly an original filmmaker , with vision . i am curious to see what he will do next . watch him .
unlike other commentaries , i found this film fascinating , even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors . being a technologist , i found that the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic . although the reading of people minds via computer sounds fantastic , experiments are being conducted now to do just this . i will note that this experiments are in a very early stage , with results so far not favorable . the characters in the movie are well cast . the girl , although overacting a bit , looks suitable dumb . the truck driver is a a ringer for real truck drivers . the minister conveys doubt at first , ( the principal investigator tells the minister that him ( the minister ) , is not sure whether he believes that god created man or that man created god . but the minute when the chips are down , he falls back on his faith . only the phd plays the zombie . the secrets that they harbor are suitably appropriate for their characters . in the face of death they react as real human beings would . the movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance by government . as strictly a thriller , the movie does not have enough thrills . as a scientific exercise with philosophical underpinnings it is fascinating .
manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences . the worst one is the lack of closet space ! some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full ! melvin frank and norman panama , a great comedy writing team from that era , saw the potential in eric hodgins novel , whose hero , jim blandings , ca n't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel , and two daughters , must share . jim blandings , a madison ave. executive , has had it ! when he sees an ad for connecticut living , he decides to take a look . obviously , a first time owner , jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent . this is only the beginning of his problems . whatever could be wrong , goes wrong . the architect is asked to come out with a plan that does n't work for the new house , after the original one is razed . as one problem leads to another , more money is necessary , and whatever was going to be the original cost , ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford . the film is fun because of the three principals in it . cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings . myrna loy , was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr. grant . the third character , bill cole , an old boyfriend of myrna , turned lawyer for the blandings , is suave and debonair , the way melvin douglas portrayed him . one of the blandings girls , joan , is played by sharyn moffett , who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint . the great louise beavers plays gussie , but does n't have much to do . the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe , who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better . the direction of h.c. potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies .
tillman jr. 's drama about the first african american navy master diver ( gooding jr. ) , who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer . the screenplay is not bad , a bit extreme at times , but the direction and acting is first-rate , and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do . i liked deniro in the lead , although its not on par with his masterful works ( taxi driver , godfather and all the others ) it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart . deniro is always convincing and believable here , very good performance , gooding jr. is not bad , definitely one of his better performances . -- - imdb rating : 6.6 , my rating : 9/10
my 3 year old loved it . i loved it , my wife loved it . so 10 out of 10 from our family . as for violence level ? not really that violent , mostly of the slap stick variety . nobody truly dies , no gore , no blood , no torture , so it certainly is appropriate for children , much more so than many saturday morning cartoons . this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go . first of all beautiful graphics , textures wonderfully done , with true depth , not trying to be realistic , but forming an artistic whole . the moss on the stones , the rust on metal , the reliefs on the wood and the stone , everything adds to the whole . character modeling , unlike many contemporary cg movies , is quirky , not cute , again within an artistic whole . the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies , but the characters are more puppet-like than human-like . i think that is a good thing , it lends veracity , how strangely it may sound , it is easier to suspend your disbelief . hair , fur , clothing , on par , at least with the likes of pixar . just note in the opening scenes when lian-chu is fighting the giant slug ; gwizdo is in front of some farmers , and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it . the setting . far beyond the likes of cars , and even walle . space has been done many times , but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings , but again it is an artistic whole , and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly . magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc. where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility , or walle where we see the immense trash towers he made , abound in this movie , everything is grand , yet never dwelt upon ; it is just the background the whole way ! the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls . the chinese wall , the islands floating in the sky . the broccoli in the sky ? that is truly where i believe cg should go , make something which takes your breath away , and do it again and again . the sound is good , the music is varied and not only epic , and thankfully without any vocals , and purely original for the movie . animation is quite good . lending its inspiration to cartoons , especially some good use of stretch and squeeze . sometimes not that realistic , but the 3d models are not realistic either . characterization is well done too . lian-chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zoé . gwizdo the wily manager of lian-chu redeems himself in the end , while zoé is n't really changed at all , but who wants that cute child to change anyway ? i at least loved lian-chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc . the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures , just as it should in a proper fantasy story . the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story , especially how the world brakes apart . the monsters are pretty standard fare , except the flocking one . it lacks the emotional impact of walle , which is the really strong point of that movie , but it is a much more fun ride , and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one , and has action from the first scene . this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time . the whole movie has , as i 've mentioned a whole vision , which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout . it seems , that the setting is ready for more adventures , and i for one would hope so . one side note , the french actor doing lian-chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first , but i 'm happy it was n't him , though he is one of my favorites . nice to hear a new , to me , voice . i give it a max rating , a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some ; i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote . approach this movie as an adventure , and as a european movie , not opposed to hollywood , but different .
despite having 6 different directors , this fantasy hangs together remarkably well . it was filmed in england ( nowhere near morocco ) in studios and on a few beaches . at the outbreak of war , everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand canyon . notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - `` i want to be a bandit , ca n't you understand it '' . it remains a favourite of many people .
i saw this little belgian gem two days after seeing 'american teen ' . make no mistake about it , adolescence is a roller coaster ride , be it american or european . 'naissance des pieuvres ' ( or as it is being called in the u.s. 'water lillies ' ) is a tale of a young 15 year old girl ( played by pauline acquart , who at times resembles a young scarlett johansson ) acts the cool , withdrawn girl who wants to be on the school swim team , just to be close to another attractive girl ( adele haenel ) . it 's more than obvious that marie is more than attracted to floriane . figuring among all of this is marie 's rather plump , unattractive friend , anne , who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl her age . along the way , we are shown the usual array of teen pastimes ( broken hearts , shop lifting , alcohol and/or drug use , casual sex , etc. ) . this is a quiet little film that takes time to work it 's way into your system ( michael bay fans , take note : the pacing here is s-l-o-w , so steer clear ) , but if you have no problem with this , water lillies is a charmer . no rating here , but would pull down a hard `` r '' , due to language , nudity , adult situations .
xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie , not only in the year it was shot but also now . it 's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century . the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth ! the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie : francois truffaut 's `` femme d ' a cote '' which is of the similar topic .
carol 's journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons . the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young , and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions . director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity , thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring . the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best , which , it seems , if the major purpose for films after all . the plot is unpredictable , yet the events as they unravel are completely logical . perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people . it was a major event of the 20th century , yet hardly any americans know of it . in fact , in 40 years of university teaching , i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it , much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it -- and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars , all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education . so , in one way , this film is a good way to begin a study of that event , keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled . the appreciation of this film is , therefore , in direct relation to the amount of one 's knowledge . to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely . the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film -- acting , production sets , character development , plot , dialogue , film continuity , and artistry -- on a scale for 10 for very good , 5 for average , and 1 for needs help . carol 's journey is above average on all counts , excepting dialogue which is rated as average . the lei average for this film is 9.3 , raised to a 10 when equated to the imdb scale . i highly recommend this film for all ages .
a most recommendable masterpiece , not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of angelopoulos , not to mention the acting of giants , mastroianni and moreau , and the remarkable character play by ilias logothethis . gregory karr 's performance may seem overshadowed by his `` tough '' partners ' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character , which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl ( khrysikou ) and the man ( mastroianni ) , albeit hinted beforehand . ( hence the spoiler . ) get your expectations straight ! it 's an `` art movie '' in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention . not for spending free time , but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert . due to the overall photographic style , large screen viewing is recommended . dialogues are used sparingly . but the film includes -in addition to the standard greek and english speaking- fragments spoken in albanian , kurdish and turkish , which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .
it tries to be the epic adventure of the century . and with a cast like shô kasugi , christopher lee and john-rhys davies it really is the perfect b-adventure of all time . it 's actually is a pretty fun , swashbuckling adventure that , even with it 's flaws , captures your interest . it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it . even if it 's made in the 90s , it does n't have a modern feel . it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had . big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i 'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had . this on the other hand , just has the real feeling . you just ca n't hate it . i think it 's an okay adventure movie . and i really love the soundtrack . damn , i want the theme song .
i have to admit to enjoying bad movies . i love them i watch all of them . horror especially . my friends and i all gather after a hard week at school and work , rent some crazy tapes , order a pizza and have a blast . one of the ones we got at hollywood video , was this one , zombie bloodbath . this one had a great box , so i was expecting less than usual . the story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed , and the other underground layers are simply covered up . the inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave . this wakes up some zombies . from this point on , it 's chunk-city . the gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll . ok , it 's not great art , but this one , with it 's in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening . actually , it was one of the best `` party tapes '' i have ever had the pleasure of watching . and you could tell it was done on no money , with a bunch of crazy people . there are hundreds of zombies , and the director looks like brendan frazer ( he has a cameo ) and it is just a wild trip .
i personally thought the movie was pretty good , very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame . i really ca n't say much about the story , but there were parts that confused me a little too much , and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy . other than that however , the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot , great effects , and a lot of sword play . another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion . well i really ca n't say anymore about the movie , but if you 're only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers , i would suggest you trying to rent it , but if you 're a die-hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film .
how powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be . this film tells it 's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within . it 's true as others have stated , how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost hollywood is in it 's special effects , overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism . so much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue . one aspect that i really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers , one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion . the older brother needed to say little , as he usually did , it was all there in that deadpan face of his ! beautiful cinematography , wonderful acting , great direction ! not to be missed !
this is , in my opinion , much better than either of the 2 1990 's versions , but is still not all that good . it feels dated , probably because it is , but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980 's period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbey . the length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90 's versions , and st john rivers is at least covered , although not very well . timothy dalton is very good as rochester , but the actress playing jane is much too old . there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it .
the movie is great and i like the story . i prefer this movie than other movie such the cell ( sick movie ) and highlander ( silly movie ) . i just tell the truth , i like a reality hehe and also a true story : )
though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience . there were some who , in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings , took this to be anti-american . i do n't think thats the case , even though some parts might be taken that way if you do n't look behind the obvious . ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened . these are stories of people who 's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a tuesday in september . as i said this film will move you , probably to tears . its not always easy to watch , for example the film from mexico is little more than a black screen with sound , but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low . if you can be strong you really should see this film . it will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you ...
i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago , and fell in love with it . it features téa leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing , one episode after the next . i guess it did n't make it so big , and was cancelled after a few seasons , but i believe it was a good run , and would suggest watching it ... if the opportunity arises .
a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam . urmila and manoj bajpai have given their best . there is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through . it looked like bollywood finally gave away it 's glamor and had some quality artists performing on screen . content wise , the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in one 's life goes beyond religion . the best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and melodrama . i simply loved it .
when it came out , this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment . to this day it 's more entertaining than most , in great part because it has james cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty `` girl friday '' played by joan blondell . also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by busby berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes . but this is a pretty strange movie . i mean in one of those numbers , you 've got billy barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler , doing all kinds of weird stuff . ruby keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times , but at least she 's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films . you 'd never guess that dick powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie ; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star cagney . as for cagney , his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time . after a while it gets a bit too much . you expect him to walk out and say , `` hey ! i 've got a great idea for a prologue ! the women are cigarettes , and they come out of a pack of smokes ! oh no , we did that one last month ! '' it 's funny but it gets a bit repetitive . in the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl , ruth donnelly , some of the established cagney gangster character comes out . in fact frequent b gangster director william keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching , and it seems at times that cagney and blondell are invoking something very `` street '' even though the characters are n't criminal . the musical numbers ... what can you say ? they stand alone as entertainment , the way that berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling . but none of them really mean anything . it means `` honeymoon hotel '' , nothing really more or less . and the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately , since the characters in the show are doing things that could n't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays . for example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper , things like that . the whole thing could only exist on film , so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous . i can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so , because this is a very polished production . it 's great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills , and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like keeler . cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well . the music i would say is only mediocre , but mostly pleasing if repetitive . bacon 's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting . the film 's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way . it 's a cut above most `` let 's put on a show '' films of the 30s .
possibly the most brilliant thing about che : part two , as we begin to integrate it with part one in our minds , is that there is no clarification of why che chose to confidentially abscond from cuba after the revolution , no allusion to his experience in the congo , no clarification of why he chose bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat , no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across south america , which walter salles has given prominent familiarity . extraordinary focus is given to che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions . yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals , to establish involved relationships . he is reasonably unreasonable . che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind . but there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men . it is the concept . in part 1 , in cuba , the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages , given food and cover , supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution . here , in bolivia , not much understanding is apparent . villagers expose him . they protect government troops , not his own . when he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system , his audience appears uninterested . you can not lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply . soderbergh shows u.s. military advisers working with the bolivians , but does n't fault the united states for che 's collapse . che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it . in showcasing both wars , soderbergh does n't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results . che 's men attack and are attacked . they exchange fire with faraway assailants . there is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat , its death toll not paused for . this is not a war movie . it is about one man 's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure . there is no elaborate cinematography . soderbergh looks firmly at che 's inflexible dedication . there are remarkable sporadic visceral shots , but being few they are all the more powerful , such as che 's pov shot during his final beats . there is an abundance of the terrain , where these men live for weeks at a time , and the all-consuming effect is of languor , guevara himself having malaria part of the time . benicio del toro , one of the film 's producers , gives a champion 's performance , not least because it 's modest . he is n't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes . in cuba , he arises in conquest , in bolivia , he falls to the reverse , and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair . del toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude . you may think the film is too long . i think there 's a genuine cause for its breadth . guevara 's affairs in cuba and particularly bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches , but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane . in the end , che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie , one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means .
cinematically , this film stinks . so does a lot of the acting . but i do n't care . if there is a strong representation of what the 80 's were like ( for a lot of us in the innercity anyways ) and what hip-hop , zulu nation , and break dancing were really like.great music , great dancing ! it almost seems like a documentary of a time now past when hip-hop was a way of life . it 's also interesting to see new york looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack . some viewers may be too young to remember that it was a poor , run down city during the 70 's and 80 's . this is the best of all the hip-hop/break dancing movies that came out around that period . of course the 80 's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and movies , but those of us who lived through it will always remember it fondly for a time when music , dancing , and graffiti were fresh , yo !
in my opinion , this is the best stand-up show i have ever seen . i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill , but i must say i think this is his best work . i would say , though , if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live . it is worth it ! most of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times , the jokes start to get old . but i have to say , i 've seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing memorized ( which yes , i realize is kinda sad ) but every joke still makes me laugh . this is truly a feel good show . dress to kill will never get old for me . i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh .
purple rain is a great film if you are a 40-something music lover who partied to prince music in the 1980s . the story is a much-used formula : rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self-respect . prince is a bad actor , but his performance , especially of purple rain/i would die 4 u make it worth sitting through the film . he is himself and as a showman , as powerful on stage as mick jagger or michael jackson , circa thriller . apollonia kotero , a former prince protégé , is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with prince , but her script does n't let her far . morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements .
the story of this film is truly remarkable . a virus cut loose and only 1 % of the human race survived . the only thing we know now is that animals rule the land above and there are posters everywhere that say , `` the twelve monkeys did it . '' thats right , the human race had to hide underground from the sickness that had killed over 500 billion people . apparently animals do not contract this disease . day by day the present scientist try to discover what type of sickness had caused this ; how it was created ; if nature did it or a mere human being had created it . all they know is that there is are a bunch of animals running around a city above them , the deaths began during 1996-1997 , and twelve monkeys have something to do with it . ( or at least thats what the poster says . ) so a current convict named james cole ( bruce willis ) is sent as a `` volunteer '' to get some samples from above . after he does his `` volunteer '' work , he is asked to be sent back in time to the year 1996 to figure out what happened to the world . cole accepts and the story of the twelve monkeys begin . throughout the story the time machine gets the dates wrong quite a few times , from 1990 , to some time during the 1950 's . ( in a middle of a war . ) throughout the time traveling back and forth , it starts to mess james up in the head and that twist the story up . the whole story is very well done and i would of gave it a higher grade if it was n't for the ending . i personally did n't like the ending of the movie and i was very disappointed . i just was expecting a more explaining ending then what had happen , but it is n't everyone who thinks this way . so i gave it a 8 , but if everyone had the same opinion as me i would give it a 6 or 7 . for the whole acting of the film , i give it a a+ . bruce willis is great for this role and he acts good , but brad pitt is completely 100 % excellent . his acting is so great , he gets into the character so well . i never really cared for brad pitt in till i saw him in this and fight club . there characters or similar in this film , he is just a little more ... insane in this film . so overall i think this film is completely worth checking out . for most people it 's a great science fiction film , i just do n't think it is a masterpiece .
summer phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she 's not able to feel and you just can not understand what she has on her mind . besides , she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century .
in an era of such awful cartoons , i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies . this movie does contradict the first . i wo n't deny that . however , when i was in the target age group for this movie , i did n't even notice , nor would it have mattered if i did . the people who made it may have used `` new generation '' to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began . perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began . this was my favorite movie at age 3-6 , and it did not scare me or confuse me at all .

after 21 movies and three years of working in hollywood bette davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with . as mildred rogers , davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of leslie howard 's affections , and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this , she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo . it also has been widely noted that her performance here , one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable , has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into howard have made cinema history . at circa 85 minutes , the story moves at a nice pace , telling the story of philip carey ( howard ) as his life crosses that of the destructive mildred rogers over and over again . howard and davis ' chemistry is all but non-existent -- davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally did n't care much for howard 's iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse ( in character ) towards him as mildred . all the same , the two seem awkward with one another ; their scenes together remain stiff , only salvaged by the ferocious acidity davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence . then again , cromwell 's direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times -- he tries to fill in some space ( whenever davis is not there ) with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time ( a calendar superimposed over a changing frances dee ) . all much in the style back then . this was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being , and in essence , the visual story is a simplified , bare essentials translation of the somerset maugham 's novel -- which is saying a lot , since at 600 pages , `` of human bondage '' would have been indeed hard to film even then . storywise , it feels that philip carey may be something of a glutton for punishment , since there is no discernible , sexual attraction between he and mildred and to compound that , mildred never hides her displeasure from the get-go . howard 's performance never seems to go through much external emotion -- his eyes are constantly sad , his expression never veers too far away from lost ( he could almost be a distant cousin to william hurt in `` the accidental tourist '' -- dejected , hurt , and absolutely passive ) , but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women ( played by kay johnson and frances dee ) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections . interestingly , johnson 's norah , once she realizes carey will never fall for her , is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people -- she is bound to carey as carey is bound to mildred , and mildred herself is bound to miller ( or men who fit the role of provider ) . in her short but memorable scene , she 's the one who holds the essence of the story 's moral .
deaf secretary carla ( emmanuelle devos ) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues . when they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult , but , when the first applicant is ex-con paul ( vincent cassel ) she seizes the chance to change her life . carla covers his mistakes and he , anxious to go straight , reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues . when paul asks carla to return the favor , she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld , ruled by ruthless lone shark marchand ( olivier gourmet ) . recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no one will have bargained for , the two set out to see justice done . french filmmaker jacques audiard 's third feature `` read my lips '' is a genre-defying piece , switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller .
i think that people are under estimating this incredible film . people are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep . which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton . this is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film . the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting , a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this . but i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining .
a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film , nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption , that may have just left it all too late . visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget . full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team , i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great . lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future . subject all interesting sex , drugs and violence . bring it on . i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you 're in the mood for a semi moody noir .
only after some contemplation did i decide i liked this movie . and after reading comments from all the other posters here , and thinking about it some more , i decided that i liked it tremendously . i love american films - probably because they are so narrative . they usually have a well-defined beginning , middle , and end . `` presque rien , '' on the other hand , makes no such attempt . i disagree with other posters that say it 's 'too artsy . ' in every way , this film is meant to evoke your sense memories . so often throughout the film you feel like you 're there ... you feel the summer sun , the breezes , the heat , the winter chill , the companionship , the loneliness , etc. , etc . in every way , the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them . after i finished watching it , i felt the same . but upon some reflection , i recognized that this is how the movie had to be : the 'story ' is n't the narrative , it 's the emotions you ( the viewer ) feel . the lighting , scenery , and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they 're rich , exquisite , and alive with detail and nuance . although i normally can not countenance films without a fully developed plot ( after all , is n't a movie 'supposed ' to tell a story ) , this film is definitely one of my new favorites .
for a while i was caught in the trap where i found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that i liked them . fatty drives the bus is the exception . it is the truth . it is the best `` bad '' movie ever . the `` badness '' of this movie seems to come naturally . halfway through satan 's opening monologue , the word `` hell '' appears at the bottom of the screen . the glamorous bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress . it takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other forever to walk down the stairs . jesus walks to a funk soundtrack . anyways , fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior 's film project . but it 's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful . you get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad , but never forced it . never to be duplicated in wonder , fatty delivers . highly highly recommended .
i am not a parent , neither am i a male . but i was able to identify with every character 's heartaches and pains . this is a movie teenagers should watch . maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again . i 'm sorry for those that do n't understand the value of love , family and friendship . it was very interesting to watch patrick duffy in a different role than that of bobby ewing . and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance . he showed at an early age , that he is capable of heartfelt drama . he should be offered more serious roles . note hollywoodland ... his first serious role in years and he went out and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006 . this movie can be appreciated by people of all ages . maybe should n't be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families , but i recommend it to the entire family . i bought this movie on dvd and have watched it with friends many times . because it portrays the values that are important in life .
this was the second of three films that irving berlin wrote for the astaire-rogers franchise and it has by far the largest score and is somewhat unusual in that two of the numbers are performed by harriet hilliard leaving the rest to be divvied and/or shared between the principals . as usual the storyline need n't detain us though for the record it was based on a play , shore leave , that also served as the basis for a broadway musical , hit the deck . anyone who actually saw shore leave in the theatre may have been momentarily bemused inasmuch as the roles played by fred and ginger were created for the movie but what matters , as always , is the music , lyrics and hoofing and this is all out of the right bottle . it 's a departure from the other titles in the franchise in that 1 ) we get to see astaire play the piano - in real life he was an accomplished pianist and composed several songs , one of which , i 'm building up to an awful let-down , had a lyric by johnny mercer and spent a couple of weeks in the charts - and it is the only one of the series in which he played a serviceman , albeit an ex-hoofer who enlisted in the navy after being dumped by dancing partner ginger before the story starts . he gets to perform a little-known but excellent berlin number , i 'd rather lead a band as well as duetting on i 'm putting all my eggs in one basket but the ultimate number is the prophetic - in 1936 rumbles of world war ii were already being felt - let 's face the music and dance , one of the most potent ballads ever performed by the team . so what if randolph scott is a little wooden and fish-out-of-water without either a horse or a six-gun within easy reach and harriet hilliard does n't exactly set the screen on fire ; we came to see fred and ginger and the only question is , do they deliver . answer : in spades .
this very good movie crackles with tension . the stakes are , of course , high -- will the police and widmark , the public health doctor , apprehend the criminals who do n't know that they are carrying plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out ? but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene -- between widmark and the police captain , between the bad guys played by palance and mostel , between palance and a dying plague-stricken man whom palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity , between widmark and his wife , and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic . the movie is beautifully shot by kazan , in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes shot on location in new orleans , and ends in a stunning climax , where palance flees like a rat from his pursuers , through the docks and warehouses of the city . the commentary is superb , probably the best that i 've heard , covering the cinematography , the framing and lighting of shots , the production design , the casting of non-professional actors in small roles , and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot , like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally . watch it once to enjoy the film on its own , and , if you are interested in film-making , a second time with the commentary on to learn .
gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders . gere , who plays babbage , refers to them as his flock . gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out . he is training , new comer allison , to take over his job . gere sees his flock as very sick , disturbed puppies . he asks them questions that are not on the list , and tries to act like the police and solve crimes . he keeps getting warned for this behavior , hence the reason he is being replaced . during his final few days on the job , a young girl goes missing , and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray . him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol . so , he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police . that part is a little far fetched . there is some sick , twisted stuff shown in this film . like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other . also , there are the people who kidnapped the girl . at the end of the film , we see what sick freaks they are . however , i would n't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film . final verdict : if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers , then you will like this .
a must see ! i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious . we 're talking nonstop laughs . it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama . amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty , brains , and serious acting ability . peter cohen , the director , has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men 's egos in the urban dating world . for all of it 's comedy , whipped succeeds with it 's intelligence . which is so rare for a first time director , especially with a romantic comedy . he is a major talent . judah domke , brian van holt , jonathan abrahams , and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick lady 's men . you 've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in peet 's web . check out the trailer on whipped.com , it 's worth the 3 minute download .
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much ! it was well acted , particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey.it was a very interesting movie , filled with drama and suspense , from the beginning to the very end.i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie , it is excellent and has great acting ! !
if you 're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as 'book of the dead ' , 'book of eibon ' or 'necronomicon ' , then you should feel right at home with malefique , a film which also features an occult tome , one with the power to change the destinies of all involved . discovered by four french prisoners sharing a cell , the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by danvers , a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s ; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished . finders of the book are carrère ( gérald laroche ) a company embezzler shopped by his wife , lassalle ( philippe laudenbach ) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan , the halfwit pâquerette ( dimitri rataud ) who once ate his baby sister , and the 'librarian ' marcus ( clovis cornillac ) , supposedly driven mad by reading , who murdered his wife . reminding the viewer of meat loaf 's equally bizarre , bosomy male in fight club ( 1999 ) , lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet , one who is especially protective of the infantile pâquerette . with the coming of the book however , and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents , marcus assumes greater and greater significance . at first assured of an early bail , meanwhile carrère takes little more than academic interest in events . suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and , as the prisoners experiment , danvers ' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers ... staged for the most part within a prison cell , and between four or five characters , malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter ( as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers ) . only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell , a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed , closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere . more than anything , this is a film about being trapped , either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding . `` i 'm going to escape , '' says carrère at the start of the film , wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son . whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price , and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an 'escape ' may not be one a man might imagine . with all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director eric vallette 's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does . as critics have noticed , it is a film with strong freudian overtones - lassalle 's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance ; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye ; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus ; danvers ' original placenta fetish ; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which 'delivery ' is awaited , etc . with so many interesting aspects to the script vallette hardly puts a foot wrong , and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what , when one comes down to it , is just a matter of four guys , four bunks , one folding table and a book . there 's a genuine , growing , lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages , while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina , or what ultimately happens to pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable . the pacing of many of the dark events in malefique is deliberate , rejecting the rapid cutting of many hollywood productions : a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore . perhaps this is a particularly european manner , as one recalls a similar , measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as verhoeven 's the fourth man ( 1983 ) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye . lensed well in 1.85:1 , malefique benefits from excellent performances and , if for this viewer at least , the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been , the journey to the final shot was worth taking . coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received haute tension ( aka : switchblade romance , 2003 ) , this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the french industry , this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from asia
in christian duguay 's movie , hitler : the rise of evil , hitler 's early years in life and politics is shown in a successful way with some minor historical errors and some exaggeration . it is quite natural for a hollywood movie to contain such things as the main purpose of production is the income that they will get from the movie . even though such errors may disappoint some members of the audience who believes that everything should be done by the book , i believe that most of them fits well with the rest of the movie , making it more interesting . we should not forget that this movie is not a documentary . who cares how did his dog died anyway . throughout the movie , hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets angry very easily and is very passionate about his ideals . but he was not portrayed as a super-villain but more like an ambitious politician . i believe that this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and this made the movie somewhat objective . yes he was a little mad , and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in `` inglorious bastards '' . i believe it made the movie more realistic even with some inaccuracies in the historical facts . the flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators . even though the movie 's focus was around hitler we also had chance to see what is happening in the country as a result of these actions via newspapers , discussions of people and the songs in a jewish cabaret . also society 's reaction was also reflected to movie but it was very limited . struggles of journalist fritz gerlich and ironic plays that are played in the cabaret was amusing and interesting but that was all . mostly we only saw his followers rampaging the streets and cheering him . another thing that was missing in the movie is information about the origins of his hatred for jews . in the beginning of the movie , some ideas about this is given but they were quite superficial . all of a sudden he was a politician who is giving speeches about necessity of extermination of jews . in conclusion , hitler : the rise of evil can not be considered as an excellent movie that everyone will like but it is not unsatisfactory at all . if you can stand directors that change history for cash , it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler 's personality in a successful way .
nina foch insists that `` my name is julia ross '' in this 1945 film noir also starring dame may witty and george macready . it 's short , and because it is , the film suffers . it could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer . when i was growing up , foch was a fixture on television , playing a neurotic woman , the wife with the cheating husband , the nervous wreck . she became one of the great acting teachers in los angeles . here , she 's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role . julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by mrs. hughes and her son ralph . little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front , set up to get just the right woman for this assignment , a woman with no family and no boyfriend . it 's a live-in situation ; once julia gets to the house , she 's drugged , and when she wakes up , she 's told she 's mrs. hughes and not allowed to leave . the acting is very good . low budget but still entertaining - some things , particularly at the end , happen way too quickly , which is why i said the movie is too short . nevertheless , i recommend it .
any screen adaptation of a john grisham story deserves a mainstream hollywood approach , and robert altman is about the last director i would go to for a mainstream take on anything . but this southern-fried pot-boiler is pretty good . while it 's not among altman 's best , it certainly is n't among the films he 's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking . altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before , in his 1973 film `` the long goodbye . '' `` the gingerbread man '' is nowhere near as good as that film , but it holds up fairly well on its own . kenneth branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client ( embeth davidtz ) who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father ( robert duvall ) . the film is set in savannah , georgia during the approach of a tropical storm , which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that i very much liked . the twists and turns toward the film 's end become clunkier and clunkier , and altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts , but overall the film is not a bad addition to altman 's canon . also starring robert downey , jr. , daryl hannah , tom berenger and famke janssen . grade : b
ok , ok , do n't get bent out of round . i was kidding . `` bustin ' out '' is actually a better and truer title anyhoo . racism and crime dramas get the satiric treat meant from our x-rated animator friend ralphie boy . and he does one of his better jobs here . on the crime front it shows the truth . they build it , defend it , then boredom and stronger rivals cause them to ( maybe ) lose it . see for yourself to see what goes down . racist ? i do n't know . with scatman ( rip ) and the love walrus ( also rip ) being black and the main point of view , i saw it as an attack on racism mostly . the fact that richard pryor liked it says as much as well . and the younger ( pre `` miami vice '' ) phil mike thomas in there was a nice surprise . it 's an animated `` blacksploitation '' film . that 's a good thing . done well and well done . it will make some squirm ( like the lynching scene ) but unfortunately that 's based on fact . but ralphie really should have re-thought that title .
bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan , an average man who feels god is messing up his life . god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways . of course , giving someone god 's powers could take a turn for the worse . bruce almighty is a good comedy , jim carrey is good , as always morgan freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well . the jokes are almost always on target , although sometimes they resort a bit too much on carrey 's facial expressions . i liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god , not only that but also as a black man . i thought this quite well , especially with the brilliant freeman . there are some hilarious scenes , the opening cookie scene for instance , others miss the target slightly but still a good film . 6/7 out of 10
* * spoilers * * since the disappearance at sea of her favorite niece phyllis murder mystery writer abigail mitchell , ruth gordon , has strong suspicions that it was phyllis ' husband edmund galvin , charles frank , who was responsible for her death . in fact abigail is convinced that he murdered her and made it look like a tragic accident . knowing that there 's no evidence to have edmund arrested for phyillis ' death and deciding to take the law into her own hands abigail cooks up this elaborate plan to do him in and make it look , like phyllis ' death , a tragic accident . getting edmund to secretly come over to her mansion to give him the combination to her walk-in safe , as she 's about to leave on vacation for new york city , abigail tricks him into going inside locking the startled and surprised edmund in . with the safe being soundproof nobody at the mansion the butler maid and abigail 's personal secretary veronica , mariette hartley , hear him screaming for help and the next day edmund is found suffocated to death . veronica discovered edmund 's body as she was about to put away , for safe keeping , abigail 's latest murder mystery manuscript . lt. columbo , peter falk , is called on the case involving the strange death of edmund garvin to determine if it 's a murder or a tragic accident . going through edmund 's apartment columbo is puzzled to find out that he does n't have a single photo of his late wife , who 's been missing for just a month ! this ties into what abigail always felt about him in edmund not being in love with phyllis and also a suspect in her , in abigail 's mind , murder . columbo a big fan , together with his wife , of abigail 's murder mystery novels has a hard time realizing that she in fact was responsible for edmund 's death . all the evidence points to abigil including a pair of missing car keys that was edmunds . this all proved that abgail was in fact in the house , not on her way to the airport , when edmund was locked inside the walk-in safe . going through all the evidence columbo comes up with this strange conclusion that edmund must have left some evidence inside the safe in writing to who his killer is . that conclusion is quickly checkmated when it 's found out that edmund did n't even have a pen or pencil as well as light , with the safe light-bulb burned out , on him to write it . there 's also something very odd that 's inside the safe that has been on lt. columbo 's mind ever since he came on the case . this has to do with the black paint residue that was found under the dead edmund 's fingernails and on his belt buckle ! it 's that evidence , when put together with a number of other items in the safe , that in the end hangs edmund 's murder on the tricky and very cunning mystery writer abigail mitchell . edmund let abigail unknowingly convict herself in his final attempt as the air in the safe was being used up , by his breathing , in using burnt out matchsticks to write on abigail last manuscript who murdered him : abigail mitchell !
national lampoon 's class reunion is a classic comedy film from the early 80 's which combines unique characters , lots of laughs , and some great music from chuck berry . when walter bailor is absolutely humiliated by his classmates at their high school graduation he seizes the opportunity to get his revenge at his class reunion . one by one he stalks his classmates who include an innocent blind girl , a horny fat guy , the high school beauty , the king of all preps and even the ugly old lunch lady who served up slops to all the kids during highschool . this film has a sort of scary element in it and it has a few brief scenes of sexuality so i would n't recommend it for young children but it 's a great movie for teens . if you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score , complex characters or killer special effects you might not love class reunion . if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and a lot of fun ( and who does n't ) then this movie should be on your movies to see list . ++

if mulder was looking for his real father here he is darren mcgavin , the first x files , pity it was only one season long the producers of this show did n't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the follow up to the night stalker , the x files . both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the x files years later darren mcgavin , as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero , s solving cases . paying homage to the man i think so , well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it was n't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker .
as a fan of author john le carre i 've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them . i found this 1987 adaptation of le carre 's masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking i would know what to expect . i was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries , a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama . peter egan gives a great performance as magnus pym , the perfect spy of the title . carrying on in the long tradition of le carre 's strong main characters , pym is also quite possibly the best . egan plays pym ( who in fact contains many shades of author le carre ) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming `` a perfect spy '' . egan plays pym to perfection as a man always on the run , if not from others then from himself . egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone . surronding egan is a fantastic supporting cast . ray mcanally gives one of his finest performances as pym 's con man father rick who ( as le carre has said ) is based strongly on the author 's own father . mcanally plays a man who comes in and out of pym 's life and is one of the those responsible for pym becoming `` a perfect spy '' . in fact if it was n't for mcanally 's performance a year after this in a very british coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career . the rest of the supporting is excellent as well . from caroline john as pym 's mother to alan howard as his spy mentor to rüdiger weigang as the young pym 's friend turned controller to jane booker as pym 's wife the supporting cast is fantastic . special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger pym ( jonathan haley , nicholas haley and benedict taylor ) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well by peter egan . the production values of the miniseries are strong as well . as the miniseries adaptations of tinker , tailor , soldier , spy and smiley 's people proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format . the locations are excellent from the english locations to the those scattered across eastern europe and the usa as are the sets by chris edwards . the cinematography of elmer cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries . yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script . screenwrtier arthur hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently . the novel was largely ( at least in its early parts ) autobiographical in that pym 's early life echoed much of john le carre 's life . the script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of magnus pym from young boy to `` a perfect spy '' . never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage . if one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight , fist fight , or james bond style car chase this would be the proof . while the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it . though it might be overlong for some for those who do n't have very short attention spans here is a must see . from the performances of peter egan and ray mcanally to fine production values and a fine literary script a perfect spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see . it is a fascinating trip down the history of the cold war yet it is more then that . it is also a trip down what john le carre has called `` the secret path '' : the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive . as much a human drama as a spy thriller a perfect spy is n't to be missed .
hmmm , yeah this episode is extremely underrated . even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts . i think the good over wins the bad . i love the origami parts and the big 'twist ' at the end . i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony . it 's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 . for some reason , people have always hated the reincarnation episodes , yet i have always liked them . they 're not the best , in terms of writing . but the theme really does interest me , i 'm gon na give it a three star , but if the writing were a little more consistent i 'd give it four .
found this one in the video store and rented it . it 's one of those quirky , quasi-comedies that 's more interesting and weird than funny . it 's a good one at that . it reminds me a lot of being john malkovich . if you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one .
a mock documentary about a pair of canadian producers , bobby myers ( matthew modine ) and paul linder ( saul rubinek ) , trying to make their first film in the late 1970s . hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together , despite a number of conflicting threads . hollywood north works as a film in a way very similar to why this is spinal tap ( 1984 ) works so well . namely , although exaggerated in some ways , it is very close to the truth , and the truth consists of `` behind the scenes '' facts that are very different than the public face of the industry . it is n't easy to make a film , and it must have been especially difficult in canada in the late 1970s . films involve tens , if not hundreds , of people . many have incompatible desires , motivations and personalities . especially crucial are the financiers and the on-screen talent , as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production , it could jeopardize the whole affair , either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether . so it 's not surprising that hollywood north focuses on those kinds of relationships . the result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time . the script is flawless and the performances are top notch . this is a must-see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film-making . it should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor . a 10 out of 10 from me .
this is the first 10 out of 10 that i 've given any movie . what made this movie so good for me ? constant action - there is n't any slow parts , great acting , smart writing . i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene . finally , i get to see an action movie that does n't try to please all sectors of the public ( i.e . there 's no forced romance ) . i liked the first two bourne movies , but i loved this one . warning - after watching this movie , you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car !
monarch cove was one of the best friday night 's drama shown in a long time.i am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime , soon.each person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true . however , the movie needs to continue for a long time . i would love to see bianca and jake 's child grow-up and get a major role in the movie , along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future . also , bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her life.it was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems , but the family business needed to be restored to working status , and let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years .
the only reason that i did not give this 10 stars was the dvd format-no menus , extras , etc . however , if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life , this film is for you . if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you . this is one of the most life-affirming films that i have ever seen . and magical . the acting is superb , the plot serves the purpose , and the opening sequence is fantastic . this is one of those films that `` cult '' status used to be about . i have recommended this film to all of my friends . some love it , some ca n't finish it . whenever i think , or feel , that something is impossible i think about alan arkin 's role in this film . sure wish he 'd make more films .
house of games is spell binding . it 's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens . there are few movies i 've seen that can grip you so quickly . from the opening scene this movie just gets you . i 'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a few spoilers so do n't read anymore if you do n't want to know . i would say house of games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists i have ever seen-bar none . from the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed . lindsay crouse as margaret ford is simply perfection , from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately . joe mantegna was also wonderful . the dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices . i also loved the way the movie was filmed , in that grainy , surreal type of way , it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was . there were a few movies i 've seen and loved that this reminded me of including the grifters and the usual suspects but really , house of games is completely different in it 's way . margaret and mike are two of the most absorbing characters i 've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet , but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying . you know something 's going to happen but you have no idea what . and just when you think you 've guessed what the `` something '' is , you realize you have n't even scratched the surface .... house of games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature . the character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well . as the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters , we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it . it is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it 's conclusion . in closing , i 'd rank this 10 of 10 , call it ( although not my absolute favorite film , pretty high on the list ) , most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best `` twists '' i 've ever seen as well . although i love all types and genres of movies , when it comes to movies of the human psyche , it really does n't get much better then this . see this movie .
david burton ( richard chamberlain , quite good ) is a lawyer , more adept at handling corporate taxation ( .. and suffers from unusual dreams which bother him seeing this aboriginal man shrouded in darkness ) , who is called on to take a case concerning a group of aboriginals charged with the murder of one of their own named billy .. we see that he tries to steal stones with ritual painting on them and is killed when a leader of an aboriginal tribe named charlie ( nandjiwarra amagula ) uses a `` death bone '' to stop his heart . meanwhile , revolving around david , bizarre weather patterns effect sydney such as rain beating down polluted dirt and rock-sized hail during bright blue skies ( with no sights of clouds , such as the one that hits a school in central australia ) , not to mention , a `` deformed '' rainbow which is split ( ! ) into groups . as david pursues the case he finds that he is far closer to the weird events taking place than he could ever realize . one aboriginal named chris ( david gulpilil ) appears to him in a dream holding a stone with blood and he finds that this man is one of those he is to represent at trial ! he finds that it 's quite possible , after some strange meetings with charlie and conversations with chris , that he very well might be linked to a spirit named mulkurul and that his dreams are actual premonitions of possible horrors yet to come . absorbing apocalyptic drama builds it 's story methodically and is completely original and unpredictable . with peter weir in charge , the film is visually arresting as we see these very overwhelming images of possible doom towards civilization , but the film 's most compelling angle is certainly david 's journey to find that monumental truth that plagues him as he questions charlie and chris countlessly , at first to help his men get off from a crime they did n't commit , and ultimately to find out what he has to do with anything catastrophic that is occurring or might occur later .
robot jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age . you have to remember that this film is over 10 years old now and was made very cheaply in the 1st place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts . so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it .
i watched this film sort of by accident , having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd . the omega man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning , which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later , the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies . but soylent green is in a whole other league . i bet this is one of tarantino 's favourites . there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i 've never seen anything like before . heston casually getting into bed with the `` furniture '' while discussing something else completely unrelated ! a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers ! a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor . ok maybe that 's been done since - but there are n't many films that are so consistently original like this . and what the heck is going on between heston and edward g. robinson ? is this the most unlikely gay couple ever , or what ? luckily , i saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare . then i watched it again , and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile . a very nice script - and some great sets too . just when you thought you 'd seen everything . . .
the movie was sub-par , but this television pilot delivers a great springboard into what has become a sci-fi fans ideal program . the actors deliver and the special effects ( for a television series ) are spectacular . having an intelligent interesting script does n't hurt either . stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite programs .
bill and ted 's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched . though the acting and scenery etc is poor , who cares . the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent , the ideas are great as well . i recommend anyone to see this classic . the best part is obviously when they 'melvin ' death , i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film . this is so much better then the first one , which was great as well . possibly the funniest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! i think the best parts of the film however , are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo , it was hilarious . rock on bill , ted and eddie van halen , bring out a 3rd film ! !
the fox and the child is the latest film from march of the penguins filmmaker frenchman luc jacquet . the movie , which boasts just one human being in its cast , young actress bertille noël-bruneau , tells the story of the rather rare , though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox . part-nature documentary , and part-fairy tale , the film focuses on l'infant , the child , who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting , possibly france , though the exact location is never mentioned . over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox , who she begins to call lily , once again . and so it goes on . days turn to weeks , and then the summer disappears , turning to fall and then winter , promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping , white winter landscape . eventually , spring comes around again , and the young child finds her fox , and indeed does strike up a friendship with the animal . and so on . i had little to no expectation for the fox and the child . i had seen march of the penguins and was simply in awe at the film-making contained in that movie . luc jacquet is a hugely talented , and indeed rare film-maker , and i was expecting some superb , breathtaking cinematography , sweeping vistas and brilliant footage of the wildlife . this was delivered in spades . but here jacquet has a screen writing credit , and not knowing anything about the movie prior to the screening , i expected something a little different than what had previously been seen in 'march ' . a fictional story . the child and the fox and the story is simple . a young , seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school , seemingly on her own , every day , seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world . without the hint of an adult in sight . brilliant . so she strikes up a friendship with a fox . with a film like this , you have to dismiss your own opinion of the movie and put yourselves in the shoes of the target audience . this is a film which is aimed directly at children from the age of , i 'd say , six and up . or to families who fancy a trip to the cinema with their breed one wet sunday afternoon . not a 31-year-old male who gets his kicks from films like the recent , brilliant wanted and the like . but , me being the newbie london critic , i put myself in the shoes of an excited eight-year old girl for the 95 or so minutes of the fox and the child . now , i have a few problems with this film . as a 31-year-old lad , and loyal lover of all things cinematic , i loved the wildlife and landscape photography . it 's visually stunning . the direction of the animal characters is brilliantly executed -- as good as you will find on any of attenborough 's efforts . as an impressionable , short attention spanning eight year old , i loved about the first half hour -- then i lost interest . it 's a little repetitive and in places quite harrowing and bloody scary for a younger child , particularly the rather dark ending . as a 31-year-old male -- i was a little frightened in places . wuss . so , it 's not a child 's film . it 's not really an adult film and i felt a little let down . is it a good family film . depends . it 's educational maybe , and the film carries a message . it 's definitely not a film i would pay the hard earned green to go see and i 'm racking my brains to try and recommend it to a certain type of film goer . it 's hard , but i know some will go see and fall in love this film . it 's very european in feel and certainly if you are a fan of wildlife themed flicks , give it a try . unsure ? well i 'd wait for the dvd for a wet sunday afternoon in then . -- paul heath , http : //www.thehollywoodnews.com , july 2008 .
origins of the care bears & their cousins . if you saw the original film you 'll notice a discrepancy . the cousins are raised with the care bears , rather than meeting them later . however i have no problems with that , preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations . the babies are adorable and it 's fun watching them play and grow . my favourite is swift heart rabbit . the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter . i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either . cree summer is excellent as christy . the songs are sweet and memorable . if you have an open heart , love the toys or enjoyed the original , this is not to be missed . 9/10
i 've seen this film at least 4 times since '84 and it 's still great every time i see it . it 's a very compelling version of the opera carmen , with amazing flamenco dancing , bare bones sets , and , of course , wonderful music . this telling of carmen is a story within a story , with each paralleling the other , until the doubly tragic ending . obviously a low budget spanish production , the film contains dancing by some of spain 's premier flamenco dancers . the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage , makes the telling of the story even more powerful . it 's independent movie making at it 's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film .
i felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film 's page because some of it was slightly misinformative . originally i posted quotes from the original poster , but i was n't sure if it was proper given that this is the `` comments '' index and not a message board ( though we used to use 'em that way back before imdb added the film message boards ) so i will edit this to make it unnecessary . well , first of all you may not be aware of this , but gene kelly first became famous for playing `` pal joey '' on broadway in the original production . when vincente minnelli decided to make a gershwin `` panorama '' film , he wanted kelly 's character to be more sophisticated than the `` goody two shoes '' roles he had been playing in most his films ( with the exception of `` for me and my gal '' ) . alan jay lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in paris based on the story of `` pal joey '' . this gave kelly a chance to play his famous role from broadway even though warners had outbid mgm for the rights to `` pal joey . '' in my opinion , the wb film `` pal joey '' is a wreck , though sinatra was suitable for the role , but other problems sunk the film ( script changes and poor direction . =================================================== you complain that kelly 's pictures are not well done , even citing your art education to prove the point . but you miss the fact that kelly 's bad art was clearly designed to be bad , and it is necessary for the story/characters . the pictures are so bad , the audience knows that kelly is n't ready for an exhibition . even he knows it , though milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her . but it 's important that the audience not be sitting there saying `` but , he 's a great artist , if he only had the chance ! '' . you want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies . then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show ; again you are not understanding the structure of the story . he refuses because he does n't want to feel like a gigolo , and because he knows he 's not really ready for the exhibition . his enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as `` joey 's '' enthusiasm to `` start a nightclub '' . but it serves the same function in the plot . remember , it 's essential in `` pal joey '' ( the play ) that joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he does n't deserve it . same with the art show . if kelly 's paintings were actually good , it would undermine this whole point . =================================================== then you complain that caron and kelly have no `` chemistry '' . i guess it 's in the eye of the beholder . i agree , the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be , but for me it was fine . compare it to even worse `` forced '' romances like the one between cary grant and sophia loren in `` the pride and the passion '' . ==================================================== when you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film , it just shows that you have n't dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism . many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters , and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism . it 's about finding love , enjoying love , then losing love ( he looks around and his love is gone ) . the movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of parisian art and also a separate phase of their relationships . if you did n't ' see that , it 's not the movie 's fault . it 's certainly not a `` load of crap '' . ==================================================
have just finished watching this film , which upset me greatly . have also been to south africa twice , around the time this film is set . it is certainly hard-hitting , and the opening scenes tend to 'set the scene ' . the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break , and there are certainly few light moments . will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again . he came across as a very twisted individual , and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared . totally agree with steve-thomp 's articulate and well thought-out comments .
`` dangerous offender '' is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl , and how she got that way . it 's based on a true story , and though i was irritated by the one-note depiction i.e . ever scowling , of the title character , and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer , i 'm forced to accept that life does imitate art , and that there are people out there like that . the movie succeeds , for me , because , although there 's little softening of the title character 's demeanour until almost the end , one is gradually moved to sympathy for her , as the movie shows how she got to her present state - which proves to be self-destructive , rather than anti-social . truly a moving movie , which will bring a lump to your throat , when you think on it - which will be often . despite its many flaws , ( including that it 's hard to watch , sometimes , because of bodily functions , and suicide attempts ) this is another production that i 'm proud to call canadian .
like the characters in this show , i too was a teen during the 70s . the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist , of being a suburban teenager in the 70s . the 70s fashions , cars , home furnishings , foods , and fads , are all very authentic in this show . the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast , who all mesh together very well on camera . i really like the unique , psychedelic-style film sequences . no other show does camera tricks like this . these cutting-edge film sequences , really help to convey the campy hipness , that characterized the 70s era . overall this is a very funny sitcom . the one thing that bothers me about this show , is it 's over-reliance on cruel humor , to generate laughs . in this way , i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children . while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right , it 's tacky that the creators of that 70s show , keep trying to imitate it . i do recommend that 70s show , mainly due to it 's nostalgia factor . it could be an even better show though , if the writers relied more on witty dialog , rather than bawdy , tasteless jokes and pranks .
i really enjoyed this thriller ! i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over . the cast was excellent , the plot was suspenseful and entertaining , and it was just an overall enjoyable movie ! i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i 've ever seen ! the girls in it were really cute also , especially denise richards . she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph !
short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men . one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses . later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays . hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival ( during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids , so it is really serious ) . with exposed , well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women . one gets caught , the other remains free and is not given away by his companion . a last encounter , a last light for a cigarette , adieu l'ami , farewell , friend . i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters , played by classical he-man superstars alain delon and charles bronson . they are obviously attracted to each other , their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout . the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow , a little like deliverance . it is also very stylish . the safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower . it is the seat of a publicity firm , so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around . the wardrobe is also very good . the ultra stylish citroen ds ( maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times ) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement . i can recommend this movie for the actor 's performances alone . delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing , in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting . both do a considerable amount of acrobatics . i have never seen bronson better than here , he really acts - and speaks french throughout , with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed . and it is certainly the man himself we hear . ( so the french language version is highly recommended ) . the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors , bernard fresson who was gene hackman 's partner in french connection ii . he is the best brainy police inspector i know . also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingénue who , as it turns out , is not so innocent as it first seems . anyone who expects the old in-an-out '' of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film . for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience , full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks , although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake .
the film torrent was a first and a last for greta garbo . it was her first american made film at mgm , the only studio in the usa that she would ever work at . it was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits , that being her leading man her ricardo cortez . torrent is based on the popular spanish writer 's vicente blasco ibanez 's work entre naranjos . it concerns a pair of mismatched lovers , garbo and cortez , who ca n't quite get together , mostly due to the machinations of cortez 's mother marta mattox . mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying . remember this is spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper . mattox has gertrude olmstead in mind as a daughter-in-law , she 's the offspring of mack swain a man grown rich in hog raising . swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered . blasco ibanez had previous novels the four horseman of the apocalypse and blood and sand previously filmed with rudolph valentino in the lead . it might have been interesting if valentino had done this one with garbo , but he might have been beyond film making when this was done . in any event , one of the valentino wannabes ricardo cortez fills in with the male lead . one reason valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is garbo 's unlike the other two works previously mentioned . when she gets done dirt by cortez who is doing what mattox and her 'adviser ' banker tully marshall tell her , she leaves spain and goes to france where she becomes a great opera star . and leads quite the scandalous life there . when she returns to spain and tries to rekindle things , mattox is even more outraged . she has a political career in mind for her son . cortez is now running for the spanish parliament which curiously enough is called the cortes . the title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside . cortez in fact braves the torrent in a row boat trying to rescue garbo from harm 's way . when they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion , the brutality coming from garbo . the special effects here , primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time . they look very similar to the shots used in 20th century fox 's the rains came that came out in 1939 and that won an oscar for special effects . unfortunately for torrent it came out one year before oscar made his debut . i 'm not going to give any endings away so you 'll have to see the film to find out if cortez and garbo get together in the end . garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting , she was remarkably subtle in her role . so she would be the rest of her career , she had a remarkable face for closeups . although greta garbo would go on to do far better work than torrent , this film is still a fitting debut for her on the american big screen and holds up very well for today 's audience .
i 'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature-length film ( a true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series ) it was really great . gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr. knightly with his poise and nobility . i was n't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but did n't feel it spoiled the movie at all . like i said , as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that were n't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well . i 've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one !
in 1976 i had just moved to the us from ceylon . i was 23 , and had been married for a little over three years , and was beginning to come out as a lesbian . i saw this movie on an old black and white tv , with terrible reception , alone , and uninterrupted , in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story . i was living in a small house in tucson arizona , and it was summertime ... like everyone else here , i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth , and its residue of fragile magic , and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday . i 'll keep checking in . i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley verel 's 'the other side of venus ' . it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy ...
the bourne ultimatum - jason bourne ( matt damon in his best role ever ) , the newest spy kid on the block , brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the cia 's latest program `` blackbriar '' to make super assassins like himself . i was so psyched for this one that i watched it 's predecessors yesterday and today . identity was as brilliant as i recall and supremacy remains the weak ( but still enjoyable ) link in the chain for the weakest plot and , aside from a car chase which this film 's chase easily tops , slight lacking in action and suspense . hoo boy , does ultimatum have suspense ! even when you know bourne will escape the authorities ( and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept ) , it 's still brilliant watching him do it . it 's mind-boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $ 150 million giant robots did in transformers . chalk it up to paul greengrass , who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary , even though he 's filming characters that are far from ordinary , in places like cia headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder . he seemed to listen to my various complaints with supremacy , as the action in ultimatum is nothing less than awe-inspiring , with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick , a hardcover book ( i 'll never look at those the same way again ) and an electric fan ( do n't ask ) . the music also helped generate much suspense , and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail-bite over . the acting is good , and the evolution of julia stiles ' character `` nicky '' put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light . damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency ( which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like matt damon could evade the cia and interpol is something ) , but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity . this longing of his for a real life could get boring , and almost did in supremacy , but just works better in ultimatum ( better script ) . i am reminded of a scene in `` goldeneye '' ( the only good pierce brosnan bond film ) in which sean bean 's character asks james if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he 's killed . bourne regrets all the people he killed , and he considers ( or at least made me consider ) the meaning of action without purpose , life without meaning , and how the government has transformed men into resources . albeit , resources that know krav maga and can make weapons out of anything . sidenote : it 's always bothered me that , despite being a superspy and hunted by the cia , interpol , and the police nearly anywhere he goes , that bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports . sunglasses maybe ? if you have a pulse and love action movies , than bourne ultimatum is for you . hell , it 's probably the best action film to come out this year . of course , you 'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first . it kind of drags a touch near the end , but i almost feel tempted to overlook that . this is the first `` 3 '' movie this summer to at least match , if not exceed , the original and that is saying something . a-
the story and the characters were some of the best i 've ever seen . the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing . i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it . i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel . or at least a remake . if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating ( stupid buster wand ) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy .
much to your presumable happiness fair readers , cage and hopper did meet and fortunately not in a lynch moviebecause red rock west is way better than any lynch movie . nicolas cage is a thirdrate actor , the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal , only daddy hopper is as mean as ever . red rock west is , despite the trite cast , one of my favorite american thrillers ; in a word , a thriller with some twists . one notices mainly the gusto , the awesome pace , the thrills , the nice suspense , lara flynn boyle 's cute tight small ass , cage 's enviable physical shape ( though undeniably ugly , with sharp , bird features , thick eyebrows and thin , rare hair , cage displayed a fine overall shape ) , hopper 's consummate routine , some moderately but truly funny moments , cage 's play with his intended persona , hopper 's rigid , psychopathic allure , lara 's meanness , cage seems a roamer , the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema , hungry , tough if needed , naive , dirty , tired . lara flynn boyle performs as the cold mean seductress , walsh as her heartless husband , and hopper as the lynchian hit-man he 's already done before . cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover . but this might be his regular look .
the picture is developed in 1873 and talks as lin mcadam ( james stewart ) and high spade ( millard michell ) arrive to dodge city looking for an enemy called dutch henry ( stephen mcnally ) .the sheriff wyatt hearp ( will ger ) obligates to leave their guns.both participate in an shot contest and stewart earns a winchester 73 , the rifle greatest of the west but is robbed and starting the possession hand to hand ( john mcintire , charles drake , dan duryea ) .meanwhile the starring is going on the vengeance . first western interpreted by james stewart directed by anthony mann that achieved revive the genre during 50 decade . the film has an extraordinary casting including brief apparition of rock hudson and tony curtis , both newcomers . the picture is well narrated and directed by the magnificent director anthony mann who has made abundant classics western : bend the river , far country , man of laramie , naked spur , tin star . of course , all the essential elements western are in this film , thus , red indians attack , raid by outlaws , final showdown.the breathtaking cinematography by greta garbo 's favourite photographer willian daniels . james stewart inaugurated a new type of wage , the percentage on the box office that will imitate posteriorly others great hollywood stars . although the argument is an adaptation of ¨big gun¨ novel of stuart l.lake and screenwriter is borden chase , is also based about real events because 4 july 1876 in dodge city had a shot competition and the winner was rewarded with a winchester 73 model 1873 with ability shoot 17 cartridges caliber 44/40 in few seconds .
this movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month , i 've watched it a dozen or more times , and it never ceases to delight me . if it was on tomorrow i 'd watch it again . such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith , two great magicians of the acting profession can create , helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden , bob newhart and robert morley . not forgetting others in minor roles . it is a simple tale , simply told , of an ex-con , a lovable embezzler , battling and succeeding with the then `` new age technology '' i.e computers , and finding affection in the process . even if it is a tad ( tongue in cheek ) implausible , even unbelievable , the characters are not . there is no violence , no sex , no bad language , and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today . a real lesson to modern movie-makers on how to make a great show from , and with , virtually nothing ... except outstanding talent .
i loved the the film . it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society , how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they do n't want disturbed . for instance , the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son , and does n't want to be reminded of his more radical youth . for a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv , but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market , even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film . a great pity . the one sex scene , which everyone seems to go on about , does the film no harm .
after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental dvds , i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes ? for a number of reasons , `` american beauty '' does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch `` big '' without wanting a cat to kick ) , i 'm glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it . normally squeaky-clean hanks plays michael sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early 1930 's . he is also a professional hit-man to mob boss john rooney ( paul newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . but after his eldest ( tyler hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up . soon , father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit-man ( a menacing jude law ) is waiting for them . on the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as i 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . it 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivan 's son . in all honesty , there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . as is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often i praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . this could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . true time-travel , even if a little cgi is needed . the story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you do n't have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster . the film is decidedly noir-ish , driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy-gun shootouts and extortion rackets . it can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his oscar-winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . `` road to perdition '' may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon .
i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night , with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing . i suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death . i have had many such losses , and this movie spoke to me . one of the major themes is how we do n't deal with questions/issues/stories with our loved ones until it 's too late -- they 're too incapacitated or dead before that happens . talk to your loved ones , listen to and record their stories , tell people you love them , resolve differences . i loved the message that there are no mistakes . i love the director 's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters -- as one of six siblings , it 's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are . his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear -- what a beautiful movie ! the casting is outstanding -- a film not to be missed !
this movie is very good . the screenplay is enchanting . but meryl streep is most impressive . her performance is excellent . she brings me to go into the heart of her role .
of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s , this has to rank as one of the strangest , and most fun to watch . i say that because of the four main actors : orson welles , rita hayworth , everett sloane and glenn anders . the first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me , especially anders . his character , `` george grisby , '' is one of the strangest people i 've ever seen on film . his voice , and some of the things he said , have to be heard to be believed . slaone is n't far behind in the `` strange '' category . hayworth is not as glamorous with short , blonde hair but still is hayworth , which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy . welles ' is as fascinating as always . one tip : if you have the dvd , turn on the english subtitles . his character in this movie is an irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says . welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups . you also have a unique ending , visually , with a shootout in a house of mirrors . great stuff ! as bizarre as this film is , i still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene . other than that , no complaints . this is great entertainment , which is the name of the game .
i loved it and was so shattered that there not making another season ! ! ! i wish they would ! it was the best show ever ! ! ! ! ! ! there 's probably not any chance of them deciding to not cancel the show is there ! ha ha i wish there was though ! i would be so so excited ! ! i really would ! i miss it ! and was especially shattered not to know what happens to jason ! ! i think they should make another one .... it i also think its silly that u have to writr ten lines to post a comment .. it makes your comment drag on .. and no one will read it ! ! i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole ... maybe they could make a spin off ! !
we all have friends . some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with , people that you can say are like your brother or sister . alice ( danes ) and darlene ( beckinsale ) are like that . you can see that from the beginning . they graduated together , they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii . they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster . the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope . it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone . brokedown palace is a very good film , it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about . but first i want to say what is good about the film . and for starters the acting is top notch , and you can look no further than the two leads . danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have . alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges , but she seems more fun than darlene . but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble . darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes , it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice 's . bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand . the film is photographed very well also . the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice , but it does show the necessary ( but underdone ) hopelessness of the situation that they are in . johnathin kaplan 's direction is quite good as well . we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day . brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive . the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film . it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection . the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison . you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life . and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do . we have it easy compared to some country 's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject . some of the music is done by a group called delirium ( i think ) but it is sara mclaughlin ( wrong spelling , but how do you spell her last name ? ) that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film . what i did n't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit . i wo n't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you 'll know what i am talking about . also i did n't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad . it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country , the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic . but i did n't get that here . overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question , `` how far would you go for a friend ? `` that is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation . let 's just hope that it never comes down to that .
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney . his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him . the car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era . this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book . spring byington performance is excellent as usual . please mr rooney or owners of the film rights , take a chance and get this produced on dvd . i think it would be a winner .
most complaints i 've heard of this film really come down to one thing : it is n't versus . yes , the cast and crew is basically the same . yes , kitamura rehashes a few shots in the fight scenes that come in the film 's second half , but that 's about where the similarities end . versus takes place essentially all outside , showcasing kitamura 's ability to craft an interesting b-movie in natural locations . for alive , almost everything takes place inside . in small , cramped spaces . here the art design is thrust into your face , and what art design it is ! we are treated to several very intricate and interesting spaces , and our characters are for the most part confined to those spaces . also a key difference is that we do n't get much action here until the end of the film . versus was all about action and cool , here a lot more emphasis is put on characters and situation and messing with your mind . because of this , alive is a far more interesting film than versus . you may not pop it in and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed , but you will sit glued to the screen for nearly two hours watching he interaction of a few genuinely interesting characters . i 'm now ecstatic that i ordered the dvd despite some naysay . you should too ! but be sure to realize this is a different animal from versus - it 's often slow , and requires a bit of thought to get the most out of it . i hope media blasters picks it up for subtitled r1 dvd release !
what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both . there really are n't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character , but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other . this film features jon voight 's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman 's as well . the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns , though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors , including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film . also , for those interested , andy warhol 's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene . if you have n't seen this movie , it is essential . check it out .
i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed . tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films . if she could do what she did with the budget of this film , i 'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture . kudos to the cast for their terrific performances ( that little girl was gold ) , and to whoever composed the music . the warped `` row your boat '' blew me away . very creative film all around .... i really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i 'd buy it in a second . if you get the chance , you should definitely see this film .
i caught this movie late at night on cable , and i was pleasantly surprised . i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known , is because the subject matter is very disturbing . but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic , it is a well acted , suspenseful and very interesting movie . both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it . and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart , the movie does n't go out of its way to be brutal either ( like 8mm for instance ) . i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies .
a well cast summary of a real event ! well , actually , i was n't there , but i think this is how it may have been like . i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film : 'communistophobia ' and parallels to adolf hitler . these should be evident to most independent observers . anyway , boothe does a great performance , and so do lots of other well-known actors . the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and i mean it ! anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal . ( that 's why it 's so terrible - it all happened , and it probably looked just like that ) . but , actually , did that last scene on the air station really take place ?
this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos , though some of the details are still there , the setup is completely different . that makes this columbo unique , and interesting to watch , even though at times you might wish for the old columbo . i liked it a lot , but then , i like almost any columbo .
as in amelie , recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant , centered on a female finding her one true love . in this case , desperation leads to a convict , which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype . clever and surprising story in many ways , except that the female is there to support the male . for those of us that do n't speak french , the subtitles are a little quick , but not unreasonable . the soundtrack , as seems to be increasingly the case with european films , is great and in perfect sync with the film 's variations . nothing seems forced . visually , it reminds me of various urban horror movies . there 's a wes craven in chicago feel to it .
this is easily the most underrated film inn the brooks cannon . sure , its flawed . it does not give a realistic view of homelessness ( unlike , say , how citizen kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers , or titanic gave a realistic view of italians you idiots ) . many of the jokes fall flat . but still , this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not , and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive . its not the fisher king , but its not crap , either . my only complaint is that brooks should have cast someone else in the lead ( i love mel as a director and writer , not so much as a lead ) .
saxophonist ronnie bowers ( dick powell ) wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood . he stays at hollywwod hotel ( of course ) . at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall ( lola lane ) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture . in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia ( rosemary lane ) to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it 's not marshall . naturally they fall in love . you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself . the plot is old ( to put it nicely ) but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices . the score is good ( highlighted by `` hooray for hollywood '' ) and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence ( with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn ) . also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie . still the movie is n't that good . the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny . lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy . also there is racism -- a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there 's some truly appalling racist `` humor '' at one point . that 's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time . i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today . all in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs . i give it a 7 .
quite a heartwarming little film and not just for the kids . john thaw is brilliant as always ( without any hint of inspector morse about him ) . the boy playing william did a good job as well though i did n't find him convincing in every scene . i loved the whole feel of the small village and the slower pace of life in those times . i also felt the scenes in london where historically accurate , as far as i could tell . it strongly reminded me of a scandinavian film i saw a couple of years ago called mother of mine . that film featured a boy being evacuated from finland to sweden during ww ii . the wife of the family taking him in asked for a girl because ( as it turns out ) she lost her daughter . getting a boy instead she completely ignores him . the fact that the boy speaks finnish complicates matters even further . i highly recommend that film to anyone who enjoyed goodnight mr. tom , it has the same feel to it .
i 'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity , as despite some rather silly goings on ; the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money . michael winner has admitted many times that he 's not the best director of all time , and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film ; but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it 's uninspired direction , and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it . the plot is rich with mystery , and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat . she finds that she ca n't afford most properties she looks at , but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price . her problems start soon after moving in , as she does n't like her neighbours very much ... and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour ; an elderly blind priest on the top floor ... the cast list is truly superb , with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast . chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines , but small parts for the likes of john carradine , eli wallach , ava gardner , jeff goldblum and christopher walken , to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon 's lifeless portrayal . michael winner does a good job with his central location , as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story . the film is a little slow to start , but it 's never boring ; and michael winner 's screenplay provides a surprise that 's almost impossible to guess from the offset , which certainly deserves some praise . like many similar slow-burning horrors , this one does n't go for the money shot early on - but unlike many , the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer , and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true ; i 've got to say that he does a very good job at it ! overall , while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it ; the sentinel is one of the better films of its type , and it 's definitely a major highlight for its director .
it 's difficult to not have a liking for israeli director eytan fox and for his movies , which describe the life in the middle east and the inherent problems gay people can have in these regions . besides he also gave voice to the young generations , and to the remarkable part of them , who really need peace and who want to take no further notice of a war that for too much time marked the existences of people , both in israel both in palestine . these reasons , in my opinion , are sufficient to consider fox a noteworthy director , even when his feeling for the melodrama is a tad out of control . however the fans of his movies ( that he realized on team with gal uchovsky , his producer , co-screenwriter and also life companion ) seem to not being vexed by this , since his new feature , the bubble ( ha-buah ) , is having the same success of the previous yossi & jagger and walk on the water . announced as a contemporary gay version of `` romeo & juliet '' , set in the present day tel aviv instead of verona and with two men ( one israeli and the other palestinian ) at the place of the two shakespearean young lovers , the film actually is quite different from that or , better , it 's also something else . in fact the bubble of the title is the world apart in which the leading man , noam , played by the fox regular ohad knoller ( yossi in yossi & jagger , but i must confess i miss jagger , the astonishing yehuda levi ! ) and his two co-tenants , a guy and a girl , chose to live . around thirty-years-old , restless , witty and firm ( despite the protagonist just spent a period as national service in a checkpoint on the frontier with the palestine ) to live a life that wo n't be only made of war . the two guys are gay and along with the girl they have established a trio in which they brotherly love and support each other . their lives are destined to change when noam falls in love with ashraf ( the tv star yousef 'joe ' sweid ) a young palestinian who came to live in tel aviv . the laws so far in force among the group are neglected , but not the will to aid one friend . still it wo n't be easy for noam and his friends , 'cause ashraf is clandestine in israel and in the meantime his family , who lives in palestine and does n't know he 's gay , is looking forward to settle his wedding with a very beautiful girl , who is a relative of ashraf 's beloved sister bridegroom-to-be , who he is also a terrorist and he will have a strong liability in the development of the plot , with consequences not just for the two men . because the prejudices against the homosexuality and the peace ( interesting dualism , if not automatic ) are stubborn and so the tragedy is unavoidable . even if the film focus on the obstacles the relationship between noam and ashraf meets with , it does n't the overlook the other characters , which turn out well written ( for example golan , the boyfriend of yelli , noam 's fellow tenant , introduced as a lively boor , and then disclosed as a sweeter and more open minded person ) and aptly performed ( besides the two leads , we must n't disregard the funny zohar liba and the lovely daniela virtzer , the girl of the gang ; moreover late marriage 's star lior ashkenazi appears as himself in a cameo ) . it also melds the gloomy tones with the more brilliant ones , even if the director ca n't do without a melodramatic conclusion . i watched this movie more than a month ago and in the meantime i often thought about it , proof that fox and his pal have a knack to strike home .
sure star wars ( a movie i have seen at least fifty times ) beats all the others in special effects , but this film has every thing else ! it has horror ( non-graphical ) , romance , robots , witty repartee , intelligence , ( surprisingly good ) special effects , and drama . i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print , and i was amazed at how well it held up today . i thought the old 40 's style electronics would look hokey , but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne . ann francis in here ( mostly ) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me . the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me . of course we all know that the `` great bird of the galaxy '' probably modeled much of `` star trek '' from this movie . no one has yet to beat robby , the robot , in terms of personality ( sorry , r2d2 and c3po ) . this movie , overall , is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to ! honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles .
simple , meaningful and delivers an emotional punch . i regularly trail through dull short films and it 's always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message , without pretensions or self indulgent directing . a boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays truant and is given the most important lesson of his life , only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around he has to share with the school bully . unlike most short films featuring children or actors these kids hold their own and it 's believable . the soundtrack nicely complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well .
ok , i would not normally watch a farrelly brothers movie . i ca n't recall ever watching one . i also do n't recall watching a jimmy fallon movie . alright , i did watch taxi , but i said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . but , this movie had drew barrymore and i just think she is the cutest thing . i do n't know what it is about her , but i just smile the whole time i am watch her . she just captivates me that way . i mean i even watched adam sandler just to see her in 50 first dates . how sad is that ? this was n't the greatest baseball movie - it was n't supposed to be . it was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . it had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .
time paradoxes are the devil 's snare for underemployed minds . they 're fun to consider in a 'what if ? ' sort of way . film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek : first contact ' , the 'back to the future ' trilogy , 'bill and ted 's excellent adventure ' , 'groundhog day ' and the stargate sg1 homage , 'window of opportunity ' . heinlein 's 'all you zombies ' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time . in the case of terry gilliam 's excellent film , '12 monkeys ' , it 's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film . repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind . some , seeing the film for the first time , will regard cole , played by bruce willis , as a schizophrenic . most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience ' visited upon him by time travel . unlike other time travel stories , '12 monkeys ' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past . cole tells his psychiatrist , railly ( madeleine stowe ) , that time can not be changed , but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 , in his own personal time-line . even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe , in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered ... cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized . if that 's the case , time is like a fluid , it always finds its own level or path , irrespective of the external forces working on it . it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much . if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time , as we see on board the plane at the end of the film , then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it ? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians
i can understand why some people like this movie , and why some people do n't . for me , though , i really like it , even if i noticed some good bits , and not so impressive bits . the animation was actually excellent , like charlie 's dream . the characters were a mixed bag , the best being anne-marie , voiced by the late judith barsi . ( i was physically ill when i read what happened to her ) also , carface is a very convincing villain , especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback ( i particularly loved `` morons i 'm surrounded by morons '' ) and along with rasputin and warren t.rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains . charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle , but i loved king gator and his song . some of the film is very haunting , like annabelle 's `` you can never come come back '' , which kind of scares me still . unfortunately , there were some bits i did n't like so much . the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused , but disney 's black cauldron suffered from the same problem . also there were some dark scenes , that young children would find upsetting , but the ending is very poignant . however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung . none of them in particular stick out , with exception of `` let 's make music together '' and `` love survives '' , and burt reynolds ca n't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing . all in all , a watchable movie , that could have been more , but is definitely memorable , and i would definitely watch it again . 7/10 . bethany cox
la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film . everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning . it is totally different to the usual movie that one has access . this film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film 's tale . i must advice that this is not a sample film . please enjoy ! ! !
many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted . that may be so , but the addition of the narrator and dr.suess like scenery makes this show a must watch . with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set , the show is both reminiscent and invigorating . the investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in . the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more . this is a success that abc should never let go of . bravo abc . lost was getting old , way to revitalize prime time . 9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more .
this is the definitive movie version of hamlet . branagh cuts nothing , but there are no wasted moments .
this is the first movie i 've seen of john singleton and he is a pretty good director . the movie starts out with a bunch of incoming freshman and it shows what happens to several of them . omar epps plays a track star with a partial scholarship and having a hard time keeping up with his work . he is friends with ice cube and beings dating tyra banks . kristy swanson is a rich girl who is date raped and becomes friends with jennifer connelly , who is a lesbian , and is n't sure about which way to go . michael rapaport is a kid from idaho who falls in with a group of neo-nazis and their leader is cole hauser . those are the three main characters and laurence fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them . it 's a great film and it 's unfortunate that the studio had to make several cuts to the movie .
good exciting movie , although it looks to me that it 's not been recorded on location in thailand , it still looks realistic . nice story about some girls having 'fun ' in one of the most beautiful countries on the world . in real the thai people are very kind .
a may day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating hitler 's visit to rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between antoniette ( sophia loren ) married to fascist ( john vernon ) and gabriel ( marcello mastroianni ) . she 's a boring housewife with several sons and he 's a unhappy , solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists . she 's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration . then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences . the film is set on the historic meeting fuher hitler and duce mussolini along with others authorities as count ciano and king victor manuel iii , describing the events by a radio-voice in off which sometimes is irritating . it 's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility . an unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters . magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing . of course ruggero macarri and ettore scola 's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting , elaborate and sentimental . colorful and atmospheric cinematography by pascualino de santis . emotive musical score by armando trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif . the film won deservedly golden globes 1978 to best foreign film . director scola 's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama . usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi-theatrical . for example : ¨le bal¨ ( 1982 ) uses a french dance-hall to illustrate the changes in society 2 ) ¨nuit of varennes ( 1983 ) a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as thomas paine , luis xvi and marie antoinette who fled from revolutionary paris 3 ) ¨the family¨ ( 1987 ) all take place in the family 's grand old roman flat ; and of course 4 ) ¨una giornata particulare¨ or ¨a special day¨ where loren and mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof .
this is a beautiful film . the true tale of bond between father and son . this is by far , tom hanks at his finest . tom hanks is really out of the box in this movie . he usually has the nice guy roles . yet in this film , he comes off in this film as a bit gritty , but still emerges smelling like a rose , even until the very last scene , the assassination of his character . the cast of this movie was well put together . i also love the part when there is total silence when tom hanks ' character shoots and kills all of the men in mr. rooney 's group . there is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene , just simply emotion . i love the look on john rooney , paul newman 's character 's face when he realizes even before seeing him , that it is tom hanks 's character getting revenge , and he knows his fate has come . the first time i saw this movie i was blown away and knew i had to go out and get the video and i since have , adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies . tom hanks is my favorite actor , so this film has a special place in me .
this is one of those movies that 's difficult to review without giving away the plot . suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on , beyond the initial superficial `` tom cruise screws around with multiple women '' plot . the quality cast elevate this movie above the norm , and all the cast are well suited to their parts : cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all - and then loses it all , diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover , cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist . the story involves elements of romance , morality , murder-mystery , suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip . i should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what 's going on . if you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense , and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution , then this is a must-see . 9/10
that movie was awesome ! i ca n't get over it 's songs . i think i 'm a little too old for musicals , but that movie deserves some credit here , guys ! my especial favorite was jack wild . me , being a british actor lover , you ca n't restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced , young men . i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen ! he looks like an eleven- year old . he 's short , that 's what helps . try posting up your replies , fellow posters , so i can relate to your experiences . oh , and about oliver reed , that guy , bill sikes , i think that drone look is really familiar . any idea where he 's starred in before ? if so , post it up , i 'd really like to know .
my personal feeling is that you can not divorce this movie from its political/historical underpinnings like so many ( american ) reviewers tend to do . this is not about growing up on main street , usa . it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west . just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else , and esther is torn between the `` tovarish joe '' and the guys . there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito . i feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director . movies like this make freedom feel more important . it is not just `` another eastern european coming of age film '' ... it is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom .
i 've just seen this movie for the second time on television . it 's lovely , warm , sentimental , very very romantic . i 've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -cybill shepherd , ryan o'neal , robert downey , jr . and especially mary stuart masterson simply outdo themselves . masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable . the movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as while you were sleeping , when harry met sally , sleepless in seattle and the `` high gimmick '' sorts of movies like big , back to the future , peggy sue got married . i hate to say this , because this cast was superb and i 'd never change any of them- but i think it did n't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as meg ryan , tom hanks , michael j . fox , and kathleen turner at the time the movie was made . it 's not superbly written - e.g. , the characters ' lines are not particularly memorable . yet it 's executed to perfection . the romantic yearnings are truly palpable , the `` feeling '' of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated , love 's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep , the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection , are so touchingly delivered . again and again , you will find yourself moved . actually , a comparable movie is made in heaven -the same romantic yearning . do see this - it 's lovely .
this film to me is a very good film ! ! i have a german shepherd myself and i wish to god he was like jerry lee ! ! i hope too that there is another k-9 in the running ! ! with jerry lee and dooley in them ! ! i do n't care what any one say these two films were excellent ! !
this review owes its existence entirely to a review . we take a weekly tv magazine to see what is coming up , and duly decide what we will watch . obligingly , there are brief reviews of most of the films scheduled to be shown on the five major terrestrial channels . in addition to the prose , each film is allocated a 1-5 star rating . 5 means do n't miss ( superior to 4 for excellent ! ) , down to 1 standing for poor . we have learned from vast experience that , with few exceptions , stars are awarded for gross taste , foul language , offensive content , promiscuity , horror , blood & guts , and especially killing off the hero/heroine just when everyone was about to live happily ever after . ( if that is n't done , the movie is denigrated as being 'predictable ' - the worst insult imaginable ! ) brave new girl was given only 1 star , thereby suggesting it was a candidate worthy of our time and attention . this was confirmed by the reviewer 's description of the movie as being a `` truly awful tale '' , and , `` stupid , just stupid '' . we watched it , and my wife and i were glad we did so . the tv magazine reviewer further stated that the movie was `` not a reworking of war and peace '' , with which we have to agree . reading through the imdb reviews for this title a day or two later , the urge to pick up my pen ( so to speak ) to add my halfpennyworth ( pronounced harf'pen'uth ( emphasis on the first syllable ) for the uninitiated ) became overwhelming . why did we take to this movie ? well , it 's just a matter of taste . we like attractive characters , believable relationships between them , interesting situations , courtesy and respect , good triumphing over evil , and so on . we liked the integrity and personalities of holly ( lindsey haun ) , her mum ( virginia madsen ) , ditz ( barbara mamabolo ) , grant ( nick roth ) , zoe ( joanne boland ) and the two male professors involved in the story . so what if the storyline includes a 'wicked witch of the west ' in the form of angela ( barbara mamabolo ) , provided that she plays the part with some conviction . we appreciated the friendship depicted between the two room-mates , with one having a financially challenged upbringing by a loving single mum , and the other having every material advantage but receiving little parental time and affection . is it any wonder that ditz felt the way she did about holly 's mum ? is it surprising that grant should take an immediate interest in holly , considering the manner of their initial meeting , holly 's dazzling smiles and her lively self-possession ? i think these issues and the events are believable enough , but it is necessary to pretend that the scholarship and other circumstances are realistic in order for the tale to have a setting . my wife and i are greatly blessed by not having any significant musical education . this enables us to enjoy the sounds produced by instruments and voices without having our critical faculties intruding unduly on our listening , and thus spoiling the experience . we enjoyed both the classical pieces and the pop , which came over well on the tv , and we were n't struck by any lack of talent . also , it mattered not that holly 's classical vocals were dubbed by someone else . we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd . the average delivered price we have paid per disk for the movies in our collection currently stands at £4.9484 ( rounded to four decimal places ) . brave new girl was available from a trusted supplier on the amazon marketplace for £1.3516 ( rounded to four decimal places ) above this figure . such a purchase would increase the average . why i should resent this is a mystery to me , but it is a testimony to our enjoyment of this film that we placed an order anyway . i have awarded this film 7 imdb stars out of ten , having docked one for overenthusiastic reception of the performances by the audiences , one for britney advertising and one for something else i ca n't remember right now . ( in case it has n't tumbled , this review is an anthem in celebration of the use of brackets ! )
punctuating the opening credits sequence is a swarthy man having a strange , all-too-real nightmare . closing in on its dystopic 2054 paris , the film begins to follow a woman into a grungy club , where she and a slavic bartender convene outside on the deck . they toss exclamations at each other to the effect that she owes him more money although she believes she 's paid it all . another woman obstructs the budding violence , only to have a bitter fight with the woman herself . the initial woman storms out , and she is kidnapped . christian volckman 's renaissance appears to be another one in an assembly line of recent motion-capture-animated sci-fi noir pictures , but in spite of whether or not that is essentially true , it tells a neatly arranged , classically unraveling detective story that keeps us in the dark in its opening minutes , even whilst introducing karas , the hard-boiled cop we recognize from the beginning as the man awakening from a terrible dream . the rudiments of classic film noir are all hit upon without any anachronistic changes , for all intents and purposes . it is in the harshness of its monochrome that volckman 's french thriller has followed no example . for the film 's animators , unfettered by the challenges of physical lighting that would normally be faced , have been able to begin with a totally black frame , and to affix utter pitch-white according to the action on screen . as they scrupulously imitate the effects of real light sources throughout the frame , the distinction of black and white here is full-blown without even any of the slightest shades of gray to tone with the characters ' less starkly definite moral codes , and the outcome is a harsh and judgmental vision of the direction in which commercial civilization is going , sporadically caused to undergo the most blaring and ruthless of illumination . it is the artistic study of film noir taken to their visual boundary of its philosophy , and nothing before has ever shared quite the same execution of this visual concept . all the characters in this decent cyberpunk film seem as if to have been walk off with purely from a gothic comic book in black ink , but all together their physical responses , their motions and the nuances of their facial expressions look ashore within a clear humanity . normally , films that try out new developments in animation allow their technical advances upstage all other facets of production . sin city , for example , left substance and overall good screen adaptation from its source material to be desired . it may not be mind-blowing , it may have its narrative conventions and its voice-over cast may simply be adequate , but renaissance , made for $ 19 million over six years , not only feels like actual noir instead of a rashly penned appropriation , but also is not secondary to all the visual innovation , which is played as if to be incidental . one leaves thinking not so much about how cool it is when karas is evading bullets shot through a crowded glass parisian street , but more about its ponderance of life and death , how life 's tragedies , such as death , make life meaningful .
this film is brilliant ! it touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way . it really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories . there are so many layers to this film . it is innovative and absolutely fabulous !
even this early in his career , capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing . this is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately . the first part looks like a cinderella story , though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince ' will lose his fortune . nonetheless , because of his good cast and fast pace , it 's easy to get caught up in the clichés . then the movie does become more original , as the married couple have to find a way to make a living . the ending is very predictable but satisfying . i also want to compliment the title-writing : very witty and fun .
the show is really funny . nice theme . jokes and one liners are really good . with little extra tuning it can become a very popular show . but the only major negative point of this show is the cast . david spade does a great job as russell , megyn price does a good job . but who the hell did cast patrick warburton , oliver hudson and bianca kajlich . technically russell and jeff are the main characters of the show , which make viewers wan na watch the show . russell is a playboy and jeff is a kind of frustrated family man , the relationship wiz ... with an experience of all the problems a married couple face in a relationship . patrick warburton - does a horrible job as jeff , he is not at all suited for the role . he is like a robot , literally there is no punch in his dialog delivery . cast is really very important for viewers to like it . the bad acting certainly will take the show downhill ...
i am not going to lie . despite looking interesting , i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard ( and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film ) , that gretchen mol got naked in it . i have never been a fan of mol , but i can not resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes . yes , that may be perverted , but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie , and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be . the film chronicles bettie page 's ( mol ) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south , and onto her new life in new york . she wants to be an actress , but she has to pay bills too . after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach , page slowly becomes a modeling sensation , and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs . i feel the briefness of the film ( just over ninety minutes ) is both a curse and blessing for it . on one hand , the film never overstays its welcome . you get to know page within a few short minutes , and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back . but it curses the film as well , because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on . she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film . you just sit there , and attempt to absorb it all , and more just comes right at you . it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film . it begs for longer sequences , and begs more for even longer explanations . it does not feel rushed ; it just does not feel all there . another bit of a fumble , although a bit more of a curiosity , is the use of colour throughout the film . the majority is in black and white , but frequently , splashes and sequences of colour do emerge . but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on , it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white . it gets confusing , and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on . while it may fumble a bit with the actions , the film stays dead-on with its themes . page , who i know little to nothing about , is played off innocently , and her world is exactly the same . save for a few shady characters during her teenage years , everyone she encounters is an innocent , and everything she does has an innocence to it . i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved , but here , it truly is something to marvel at . all at once , it is beautiful and innocent . even the most sexually perverted moments in the film ( albeit tame compared to today 's standards ) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them . there is just something about the way mol 's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films . it just feels so natural and so wondrous , that if there were any reason to watch the film , it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol 's body as she plays bettie page . the other reason is mol herself . as page , she exemplifies that 1950 's southern belle everyone knows ( or can at least imagine ) . despite her profession , she is still a normal person , and still looks at herself as being religious . mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950 's . she plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself . unfortunately , the supporting cast have very little moments to shine , and are totally overshadowed by mol 's wonderful performance . none of them do anything particularly pleasing , and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does . this is not really the fault of the actors , but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with . many of them are totally recognizable , such as oscar-nominee david strathairn ( in a role a little too close to one of his better performances ) , sarah paulson ( recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip ) , and character actor lili taylor , but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay . none of these characters are really developed , and they really just stand as character cut-outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance . really , this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity , and for gretchen mol 's excellent performance of bettie page . everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be . had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story , this film would have been a much better biographical film . as it stands , it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress . 7/10 .
this is , by all categories , the best movie i have ever seen . forget hollywood - their movies always sucked - this is art ! moon child 's story starts with kei - a japanese vampire , who loathes what he has become and lives in denial . his wish for final death leads him to mallepa , where refugees from several asian countries live . here , he meets sho , an orphan living on the street . from here , the movie is an intense experience which bases on the visual and emotional part of the movie . it has everything ; you laugh , you cry , you get angry , excited , sad , happy ... never has a movie touched me the way this movie do . and the actors are amazing - never have i heard anyone speak so many languages without it sounding strange . a big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece ... a last comment on this brilliant movie , is that it stars gackt ( ex-vocalist of malice mizer ) and hyde ( vocalist of l'arc~en~ciel ) in excellent roles as sho and kei . i am amazed at how gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depending on what age he is acting out . this is a must see . if you never see any films , see moon child , the crow ( brandon lee ) and the newly released masterpiece final fantasy vii - advent children . all in their original languages , of course !
it seems a lot of imdb comments on this film are biased , in the sense that they try to compare it to an older version . true , `` hollow man '' is a remake of sorts of `` the invisible man '' , but that 's where the similarities end . `` hollow man '' is an entertaining movie , period . if you watch a movie with the intention of finding as many flaws as possible , then you should n't watch movies in the first place . true , some movies are plain horrendous and unbearable , but `` hollow man '' manages to entertain and make you think what you would do if you were invisible and if you had your ex getting laid with one of your friends . kevin bacon stars as a eccentric scientist who , along with a team of collaborators , discover the way to make animals invisible . now his mission is to make them visible again . when this team of young scientists ( working , as you might guess , for the pentagon ) think they have the formula for making animals visible again , kevin bacon volunteers to be the first to try the new experimental drug . after that , of course , things go wrong , as kevin bacon remains invisible for the rest of the movie and is obliged to wear a latex mask , so his collaborators know where he is . feelings of paranoia and desperation begin to take over kevin 's character , and when he finds out that his ex girlfriend and collaborator ( elisabeth shue ) is having a torrid affair with another of the young scientists in the team , he finally snaps . the movie then turns into a hybrid of `` alien '' and a slasher flick , but that 's not saying it 's a bad turn . there are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace . the special effects are top notch ( a quality always prevalent in all of paul verhoeven 's films ) as we get to see some `` body reconstitution '' sequences never seen on a movie before . if there 's anything to complain about , perhaps , is the predictability of the situations herein ; by the first hour of the movie you know kevin bacon will make the jump from being weird and eccentric to being a homicidal lunatic in the end . and the ending is a bit abrupt , but despite this , hollow man is still worth watching . if you want to know what a truly bad movie is , then waste your money on `` fear dot com '' ( with stephen dorf ) or the even worse the untold ( or `` sasquatsh '' , with land henriksen ) . now that is `` hollow '' ! 8 * out of 10 * !
actually , i never bought into the metal was satanic and stuff , but this movie kind of played on that idea . though certainly not a movie to take seriously or to rate really high , it does serve its purpose in that it entertains while it is playing . the story has a metal band burned to death in their hotel , one of their fans has a dream to this effect and said band starts to go on a kill spree from beyond the grave . so yes , a bit of `` nightmare on elm street '' plot going on here . granted freddy never molested a girl in a car before . there was another movie featuring a heavy metal band in it , but it was very different in how it played out as it had a band that kind of took over a town of kids and made them crazy . this one simply has the one fan of the band kind of helping the killer spirit at first then trying to stop him . nothing to gruesome in it as i do not remember all that many gory kills . quite frankly , the scene i do remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and then being molested by some creature incarnation of the band . nothing great , but a nice time filler .
thanks to warner archive , i can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink . ( the bathtub , however is present . ) this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to warners at the time . if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some , it is because they were big in the silent days , and most faded with the popularity of the talkies . there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well . you will be most impressed with winnie lightner , who performs two numbers . also there is that french star , irene bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner . perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip technicolor `` chinese fantasy , '' which has been restored for this version . it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas . finally , there is the massive `` lady luck '' finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour . this is truly an epic of the early-talkie era . any old-movie buff will love this .
i bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering texas day but was pleasantly surprised . after suffering through `` saturday night foolishness '' i had no desire to see a re-make in some south texas barnyard .... and i did n't . john revolta was good as the jealous redneck , scott glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con , and debra winger was , as always , a delight . * love that woman * plus , the soundtrack was dynamite [ and this comes from a guy that ca n't stand the sound of country music ] . a fun film all the way .
having not seen this film in about 20 years i am still impressed with it 's hard -hitting impact and stellar acting . of course , one mr. mickey rooney is indeed , incredible in his role as the ring-leading `` killer '' . ( in reference to another review here-none other than orson welles evoked mickey rooney 's name as the greatest movie actor , also . ) i also recall the jazzy-brassy score and the bare black and white photography . i love the mick 's last line before he goes out for his dose of lead poisoning . ( i think the stranglers lifted it for a line in one of their songs-get a grip on yourself . ) this is a great film and unjustly buried film . let 's get it out ! side note-a recent film review magazine gave a big write up on don segal 's `` babyface nelson '' , made a couple years before `` last mile '' and also starring mickey rooney . another rave of the mick 's intense and sympathetic performance.perhaps it 's the start of a groundswell of a appreciation for some truly superior cinematic performances .
this is definitely one of the best movies i 've ever seen -- it has everything -- a genuinely touching screenplay , fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch , an actually elegant romance ( it 's a shame that that kind of romance just does n't seem to exist anymore ) , lovely songs and lyrics ( especially the final song ) , an artistic score , and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them . the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end -- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there . definitely check this movie out -- over and over again . there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look .
wow ! i loved this movie and love judy marte ! ! this girl is n't just an awesome pretty face , she 's funny and really really talented ! ! she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her ! we 'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years ... and probably also from director peter sollett and co-star victor rasuk ! raising victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time ! very refreshing ! it 's true , nice , funny , well filmed , it got it all : good story , good actors , good film direction ! if you like simple , slow paced , real life , urban movies , like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith , you 'll love victor vargas ! it 's better !
this movie is very great ! the acting is fine , with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients . in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman , and then he goes crazy . he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman , beside the patients he tortures . the most special effects are also beautiful , although some are really fake ( like a drilled-out tongue , that has laid for 1 night outside , and is still red in the morning ) . but the torture scenes are absolutely well-done . though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow ; between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts . but for the real horror/thriller-fan this is a must-watch !
this is actually a trilogy of 3 of somerset maugham 's short tales . the first one is the verger , which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable . after 17 years albert foreman is laid off from his church job because he ca n't read nor write . so what does he do ? opens a tobacco shop , of course ! the second is mr. know-all which was actually a story i had read for school 6 years ago and instantly forgotten , until i heard the familiar introduction . another 15 minute one , and also very good . it worked better on film than in a book for me , but then perhaps that 's because i was only 14 the last time , afterall . the 3rd one is nearly a let-down . almost an hour in length , it simply drags . it 's not all that bad , but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 . i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour , and found that it still made sense and really i had n't missed a thing ! overall i give them 8 , 9 , and 6 out of 10 , respectively .
a woman who hates cats ( alice krige ) and her son ( brian krause ) have moved into a small town , and must deal with a mean teacher ( glenn shadix ) , their incestuous relationship , a lovely girl ( mädchen amick ) and one hell of a big secret . okay , so technically , this is a `` bad film '' . but , who cares ? it 's so very fun ! impossible things ( involving corn ) happen , people freak out about kitty cats , there 's bad one-liners , there 's too much cheese to handle ! so , yes . you will enjoy this . a lot . it wo n't move you , touch you , scare you , or thrill you in any way , but it will keep you entertained and laughing !
this is a great movie . i love it more each time i watch . most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags , but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as ben stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo , or hank azaria says good-bye to louise lasser , or geoffrey rush flashes his fuhrer choreography , or tom waits mumbles while he watches the news report , or janeane garofalo refuses a kiss from paul reubens -- is a pleasure . this is pitch perfect ensemble acting . the story develops directly and consistently , the action sequences are creative and not too dominant , all the set-ups payoff by the end . seriously , if you 've seen it and it 's been a while , watch it again , and if you have n't then get started . you ca n't watch it again until you 've seen it the first time . ( wes studi , william h. macy , the tryouts scene . too much good stuff ! )
`` kalifornia '' is a great film that makes us look at ourselves.the film has a great cast , brad pitt ( johnny suede , a river runs through it , and the legends of the fall ) as early grayce , david duchovny ( the x files ) as brian kessler , michelle forbes ( star trek : the next generation , homicide : life on the street , and escape from l.a. ) as carrie loughlin , brian 's girlfriend , and juliette lewis ( natural born killers , cape fear , and what 's eating gilbert grape ) as adele corners , early 's girlfriend . brian kessler is a writer who is a liberal , is getting ready to write a book about serial killers.brian and his girlfriend , carrie decide they want to move to california , so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california , to share expenses on the trip . early grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole , who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town , is in debt , owes his landlord money.early 's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job.early goes to the college and sees the ad , he later tells adele , his girlfriend about leaving to go to california.early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town.brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord.for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends , carrie and adele become real good friends . their journey is a very learning one.though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie.the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question.early grayce is a sociopath who does n't see the error of his ways , goes down hill later on and pays the price . this film is a great movie , i give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up.i love the songs in the movie , especially at the end of the film , the song '' look up to the sky '' by the indians .
i do n't know much about the rat pack , and frank sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me . so when i call this one of my all-time faves , it 's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality . as another reviewer says , mad dog time is about symbolism , not realism . it 's kafkaesque ( a pity kyle maclachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd , when he was so good as josef k ) , it 's stylish , knowing , sardonic and slick . jeff goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters , trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily , trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others do n't , whom he can outshoot and whom he ca n't . gabriel byrne and richard dreyfuss ( his best performance ) have a ball , and the supporting cast look spot-on . the symbolism , the settings ( the one outdoor motion shot with jeff goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry ) , the dialogue ( style , not practicality , is the order of the day ) , it 's all about characters interacting , not really gangsterism . fun to watch , must 've been fun to do . what the critics were up to is really a mystery ...
will smith is one of the best actors of all time . i do n't know how he does it . i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it . he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there . this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet . i watched it on saturday and i still can not get it out of my head . amazing and sad all at the same time . thanks again will . you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie . you can not miss a thing . make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle . well worth the money that you will pay to watch it .. do n't wait for it to come on tv .
bizarre , trippy , forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the williams family , living in the california desert . they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness ; apparently , they 've been caught in a time-space warp , where past , present and future collide . this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show , dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other , a friendly and tiny little e.t . who enchants the granddaughter , and so on . this picture does show off a little imagination , if nothing else . very nice music by richard band , engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen , randall william cook , and peter kuran , and , importantly , a likable family are key assets . it generates a sense of child-like amazement ; it may very well be that it 's more of a romp for kids ( or the kids inside many of us ) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation . i found it hard to resist ; it 's a short and sweet ( 80 minutes ) diversion , and a decent credit for director john `` bud '' cardos ( of `` kingdom of the spiders '' fame ) and executive producer charles band . 7/10
i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out . i did n't really understand the humor back then , but this movie can make me laugh out loud . with all due respect to george burns ( rip ) , walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film . his performance is amazing -- given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character , willie clark . his mannerisms are first-rate . ( `` you know what kind of songs he wrote ? sh * t ! '' and when speaking to the spanish-speaking guy at the front desk : `` no ! no ! no enchilada ! ! '' ) absolutely hilarious ! kudos to richard benjamin , who played straight man to matthau . i just wish this was on dvd , because my vhs recording is getting a bit old . i had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen , because in no way can it match the original .
this is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession . matiss , on a lonely night stroll in riga ( ? ) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing . he passes by without a word . only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act . and then only too little and too late . the film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman . on a troll of local bars , he finds her pocketbook . he pieces more and more of her life together . his `` look '' changes as his obsession grows . he has to make things right . in a marvelously filmed dialog with the `` bastard ex-boyfriend '' he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel . haunting long takes , a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt , barking dogs . footsteps . lovely film noir with a lovely twist . a good indie ending .
if hollywood is to be believed , being in the the navy is nothing but a bludge . though the sailors may complain in chorus about the monotony of the ocean , it seems that their oceanic duties are completely non-existent , and somehow fred astaire finds enough free time during the day to offer dancing classes to a fleet of would-be romantics . such is the world of astaire and rogers . mark sandrich 's previous film , 'top hat ( 1935 ) , ' completely ignored the great depression that was then bringing america to its knees , and presented audiences with a glittering world of the rich and famous ; it was the film 's optimistic outlook on life that perhaps contributed to its success . likewise , here sandrich deliberately forgets that the life of a naval officer is difficult and draining , and instead substitutes the duties of a sailor with an assortment of catchy lightweight musical numbers . `` bake '' baker ( astaire ) and sherry martin ( rogers ) are two former dance partners whose romantic relationship fell apart after the latter rejected a marriage proposal . after bake returns from several years of duty in the navy , he finds sherry as dance hostess in an unsophisticated san francisco ballroom . while the two former lovers alternately attempt to woo and rebuff each other , sherry 's plain , music-teacher sister ( harriet hilliard , looking really quite pretty ) receives a complete makeover and tries to charm superficial sailor bilge `` bilgey '' smith ( randolph scott ) . there are plenty of the usual screwball comedy shenanigans , a few moments of mistaken identity , and even a hilarious trained monkey that steals every scene it 's in . particularly amusing is the scene in which bake sabotages a performer 's audition in order to create a window for his estranged girl ; unluckily for both of them , it is an unfortunate sherry who drinks the bicarbonate of soda and loses her ability to sing . 'follow the fleet ( 1936 ) ' was the fifth winning collaboration between fred astaire and ginger rogers , and the third ( of five ) in which sandrich directed the pair . irving berlin provided the film 's music and lyrics , and each musical number is enjoyably lighthearted and entertaining , even if they are n't quite as memorable as those in 'top hat ( 1935 ) , ' 'swing time ( 1936 ) ' or 'shall we dance ( 1937 ) . ' astaire attempts to break free from his typical rich-man-about-town persona , without much success , but it 's hard to imagine the performer without the boyish carefree charm that could only accompany being considerably wealthy . the side-plot of the romance between connie and bilge works well with the antics of the two main stars , and harriet hilliard ( wearing a brunette wig to avoid clashing with ginger 's blonde hair ) has a couple of emotional solo numbers , including `` get thee behind me satan , '' which was originally written for 'top hat . '
`` panic in the streets '' is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director elia kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans , using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation . as a result , the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable . an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster , provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken , then increase the tension to a high level . following a dispute between the participants in a card game , a man called kochak ( lewis charles ) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area . when the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus , u.s. public health official dr clinton reed ( richard widmark ) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague . reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action , anyone infected could be expected to die within days . as the identity of the dead man is unknown , the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police commissioner are not fully convinced by reed 's briefing . they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently . the investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community , a group of seamen , the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man 's identity and his contacts are eventually found . kochak , an illegal immigrant , had been in a gang with blackie ( jack palance ) , raymond fitch ( zero mostel ) and vince poldi ( tommy cook ) and when gang leader blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation , he presumes that kochak must 've smuggled something very valuable into the country . as kochak and poldi were related , blackie assumes that poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more . poldi , however , is very ill and unable to provide any information . blackie brings in his own doctor and together with fitch starts to move poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase follows . richard widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man . in an unusual type of role for him , he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly . jack palance 's film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges kochak 's reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation . his distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling . in typical docu-noir style , expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place . elia kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside .
i must say , i was surprised with the quality of the movie . it was far better than i expected . scenario and acting is quite good . the director made a good job as well . although some scenes look a bit clumsy , it is a decent movie overall . the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end . the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good . the plot was clear , consistent and well thought . some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development . moral of the story , it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good .
i saw soylent green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t.v . or video . it was always one of my favorite sci-fi and/or charlton heston films . recently , the egyptian theater in l.a. had a twelve film charlton heston retrospective . i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print . from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic . charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great . their chemistry together is wonderful . the film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print . fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works . the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . just think how the world population grew , the rain forest that disappeared , resources used up , green house effect getting worse since 1973 . i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . its reputation should be better . speaking of reputations , often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor . seeing him in el-cid , soylent green , the warlord , the omega man , will penny , and major dundee back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors . of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are .
alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand . due to a incident , they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend . but at the airport , alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison . now it 's time for ultimate survival and true friendship . this was a pretty good movie , i 've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained . claire danes did a great job as usual , she is a great actress . i would give brokedown palace 8/10
by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers , harry dodge and silas howard . they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style , and it 's beautifully shot by ann t. rosetti , and wonderfully written -- truly poetic . the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere . this film has so much energy , so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it . i ca n't recommend it highly enough ! the best butch buddy movie of all time !
the year is 1896.jeff webster ( james stewart ) does n't like people.there 's only one friend he 's got and he 's ben tatum ( walter brennan ) , an old sympathetic man.they 're driving a cattle herd with them.that would be their key to richness.in skagway they run into trouble when sheriff gannon ( john mcintire ) takes the cattle.now jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the u.s. canadian border to dawson.now they have a group of other people with them , like the ladies ronda castle ( ruth roman ) and renee vallon ( corinne calvet ) .there the two men get into the gold business.anthony mann 's and james stewart 's fourth collaboration , the far country ( 1954 ) is a fine western , indeed.the acting work is superb.walter brennan makes a terrific sidekick to stewart.ruth roman is brilliant and corinne calvet 's delightful.jay c. flippen is very good as dawson marshal rube morris.the great jack elam and kathleen freeman are seen in smaller roles.it 's fantastic to watch how jimmy stewart overcome 's all the troubles in his way.there 's just the man and his rifle.but also he 's vulnerable .
this movie is why i found this website . i could n't find this movie anywhere else ! i am so glad we found it here ! we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it . one other poster commented that it is was boring , though i must say that it is not . especially if you are a horse person , you will love this movie . the horses are awesome , well trained and the movie is well done . it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library . we will be recommending it to our friends . the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses . this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times .
`` twelve monkeys '' 's got all the elements to become terry gilliam 's masterpiece . an outstanding screenplay , a sustained rhythm , clever sometimes ironic dialogs . moreover , he had a good nose about the cast . `` twelve monkeys '' is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies . here , a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero ( as it was the case in `` die hard '' ) . no matter how he tries , he 's a prisoner of the time . the movie contains a very thrilling end too . it 's got a real dramatic power . but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man , the dangers he dreads ( notably , the ones that could cause the end of the world and here , these are virus that can create illnesses ) . no matter how long it will take , `` twelve monkeys '' will be estimated at its true value : one of the masterpieces made in the nineties .
this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard grieco , ( rex ) , '' dead easy '' , '04 , decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot , sexy waitress . while rex steps out of the cafe , he sees a state trooper and asks him , '' are you fast ? '' and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one . nancy allen ( maggie hewitt ) , '' dressed to kill , '' , '80 , is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast . maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down , western style , with the local top cop in town . this is a different film , however , nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together !
splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix : mystery , thriller , musical . briefly , we are allowed to tell about the story : a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then ... soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic . in a no time , no place way vigalondo managed a delight in b/w by means of imagination and despite ( thanks to ) the tightest of budgets . because of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem ( almost a haiku ) . spain , land of quick poetry in b/w ( ¿remember the early buñuel ? ) . a must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states .
batman : mystery of the batwoman is the latest animated batman straight to video/dvd movie to be released . ( minor spoilers ahead ) the plot revolves around a new crimefighter , the batwoman , who seems to be personally involved , for whatever reason , in stopping a major arms shipment . although the movie is interesting enough , it 's not as good as 'mask of the phantasm , ' 'sub-zero , ' or 'return of the joker . ' the main reason being is that it does n't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did . at the end of this movie , we do n't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others , especially , 'sub-zero . ' there is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us . even the batwoman is not really a 'tragic ' character ( as mr . freeze or phantasm were ) . not only that , but batwoman 's alter ego seems so incredibly 'stiff ' and dull that the viewer does n't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we do n't get this special emotional appeal . do n't get me wrong , i did find the movie enjoyable . it does have its moments , such as , when the audience finds out who batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original 'batman : the animated series . ' the action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments . if the batwoman 's background was more interesting , this movie would have been better than 'return of the joker ' in my book , but as it is now , it 's in 4th ( out of 4 ) . as for the animation , it 's the same as the new batman adventures ' cartoon from the mid to late 1990 's . the score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated batman films , but it 's still good nonetheless . i do recommend buying this dvd because , despite its flaws , it is enjoyable . but just remember , it 's not as good as the other batman animated movies . 7/10
`` painting is seeing , then remembering better than you saw . '' so says dick heldar ( ronald colman ) , the painter in the light that failed.the movie is in the grand old hollywood style , starring ronald colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes ida lupino in her first important role , dependable character actor dudley digges ( who also co-starred with colman in condemned . ) , and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston . the title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that dick will lose his sight . he 's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart maisie ( muriel angelus ) are playing with a pistol . later a wound while fighting in the sudan is the catalyst for his blindness . he becomes a famous painter , but he 's already blinded by ambition , and does n't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him . enter bad girl bessie ( ida lupino ) , and his self destruction is set in motion . lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off colman very well . her evil tart reminds me of bette davis in of human bondage . well acted and well directed , this is one of my favorite colman melodramas .
there is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by joe johnston that goes something like this : `` the man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he ca n't are both right . '' that is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual , which , in this movie , stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way . `` october sky '' is about a young man who believes in himself named homer hickam , growing up in a strict , traditional family in the 1950 's . homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner . all of his friends , quentin , roy , and o'dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else 's . homer is not exited about that future . one night , while everyone stares at the sky , a russian space craft called sputnik passes overhead . this is something new for homer , and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming . from this point on , his look at life will never be the same . first , he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation . flabbergasted at what he says , his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual his friends , however , think that this idea may have some potential . after all , quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing . when the four friends start to test model rockets , and blow a white picket fence to smithereens , then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them , they 're forced to end their progresses . the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish . all of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here . standing out in all of the glory : laura dern as miss riley . this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released . the characters are also extremely well developed . not only to the filmmakers give clear , apparent reason why homer is interested in the subject , but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry . we clearly understand all of the characters ' motives and beliefs , especially the father , who is bent over on everlasting tradition . the film , unfortunately , loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly , recycled romantic sub-plot involving homer 's love interest and how his brother stole her from him . this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies , not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers . the actors stare at each other mindlessly , like the are in a trance . i put up with it without complaining in 1997 's `` inventing the abbots , '' but i have had just about enough this . but that is just a minor complaint . with an authentic looking time period , cinematography worth an oscar and clips of the real life homer and friends at the end , whom all hit it big with their dreams , especially homer , this is the first great film of 1999 .
director sam fuller has something of a cult following , particularly in europe . yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable . he did however direct one really terrific movie in `` pickup on south street '' . made pretty early on in his career , the movies that followed were vastly inferior . from the first to the last frame , `` pickup '' works on all levels . it 's filmed with flawless fluidity , boasting fine performances all round . richard widmark and thelma ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances , are at their peak . widmark , who was no stranger at playing villains , while truly mean to the core , still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making jean peters character 's falling for him all the more credible . fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie . there is a scene in which jean peters get roughed up by widmark . it 's truly shocking in its reality . this is not a case of carefully choreographed photography . less self conscious than many film noir 's of the period this remains a great example of the genre .
strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man ( william h. macy ) who finally decides to leave the family business ( murder for hire ) run by his quietly over-demanding father ( donald sutherland ) while seeing a shrink ( john ritter ) and flirting with another patient ( neve campbell ) . talk about a major dilemma , but `` panic '' is a top-notch thriller that looks like `` american beauty '' meets `` the professional '' . macy and sutherland are the stand-outs here . remarkable debut for first-time writer/director henry bromell . i 'm surprised that this movie did n't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks .
well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by it 's greatness . fantastic script , great acting , costumes and special effects , and the plot twists , wow ! ! in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself . great , i would recommend this film to anyone , especially if i don ; t like them much . terrific
the final chapter in the hanzo the razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation . inoue replaces yasuzu masumura ( blind beast , red angel , manji ) in the director 's chair , but the style is pretty much the same , perhaps due to shintaro katsu serving as the producer , apart from the titular antihero . hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake . of course , hanzo being hanzo , he 's not put off by the fact she 's a ghost , so he proceeds to rape ... ahem , interrogate her , using the now familiar revolving net device . the plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks , corrupt officials , promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash . hanzo 's superior officer , onishi , and his two servants , provide the typical comedic notes , and generally , it 's business as usual . significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first ( which is all over the place and a bit of a mess ) , less stylish , dramatic and bloody than the second ( arguably the finest in the hanzo series ) , but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits . complete with trademark training sequences , the obligatory rape , swordfights , and a mystery hanzo is called upon to investigate , this will ultimately satisfy the fans .
the man in the white suit is one of those delightful comedies that ealing studies made so well in the 40 's and 50 's . the plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . of course , this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . however , things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people , including cloth manufacturers , the cloth mill 's workforces , and even an old lady that does her washing every week . the man in the white suit is a film about scientific advances , and the way that they do n't always help ; as the old woman says at one point in the movie , `` why cant you scientists just leave things alone ? '' like a lot ealing comedies , this one stars sir alec guinness . alec guinness is a fantastic actor ; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence ( and he does in this film , literally ) , but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . he is suitably creepy in this film , and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ; an intelligent and ambitious , but slightly naive scientist . along with guinness , the man in the white suit also features joan greenwood , the deep voiced actress that co-starred with guinness in the simply divine `` kind hearts and coronets '' and michael gough , a man that would go on to get himself the role of alfred in the batman films . the acting in the film is n't always great , but it is always decent , and it 's fits with the film . the man in the white suit is an intelligent , thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral . the comedy is n't always obvious , and it does n't always work , but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs , so that is forgivable . i recommend this movie , basically , to anyone that is a fan of movies .
great voices , lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie . the addition of `` character '' to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning , particularly the relationship between the older fellow , shadow , and the young hellraiser , chance . the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive , which is done perfectly here . sally field is lovable in anything , but really shines in this film as the proud feline , sassy . great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life , and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent . there 's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery . definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids . hats off to disney .
i 'm italian and when i 've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty : the first time i was 10 years old and i liked it , but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings . now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema ( pasolini etc . ) , by that time gone . the hollywood epic films are good ... for fun . perhaps this 'odyssey ' had no english version because is not enough funny ... not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience . however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist reflections . in italy was recently released a very good dvd version : integral , with excellent colors . you can find it in some file sharing , but it 's italian only , and without subtitles . too bad : also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable .
david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f. zanuck , directed by henry king and starring gregory peck { king david } , susan hayward ( bathsheba ) , raymond massey ( nathan ) , kieron moore ( uriah ) and jayne meadows ( michal ) . the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible . it follows king david , who as a child had slain the giant goliath , and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel . a tough and assured king , david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems . for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower { re ; bath } , it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal ; a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon . typically for the genre , david & bathsheba is a large , grandiose production . from its excellent set designs to it 's positively gorgeous technicolor photography { leon shamroy } , it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values . untypically , tho , the film is sedately paced and relies on 99 % of its worth being driven purely by dialogue . this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle . this is a very humanist picture , in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here , it 's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart . but that is no bad thing at all , because breaking it down we find it 's very well acted { peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well & hayward is pushing it to the max } , and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king . and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing , the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne 's ( the ghost and mrs. muir ) oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout . sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical/swords & sandals genres ( most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point ) , but really it 's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres . 7/10
the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years . i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time ! ! the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york , and the impression i had of `` trying to be as american as possible '' ... which i think has absolutely failed . the scenes in the back really got to my heart . the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award . she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen . in future i will watch more of her movies . great luck for me that i am a native german speaking = ) and only for a year in the us , so as soon as i am back i 'll buy some riemann dvds . so to all out there who have not seen this movie yet : watch it ! ! ! i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet , especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain , but simply watcxh it , you will be zesty ! ! ! ! ! ! !
grand canyon falls under a very scarce category : it is a very clever film , with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end . i have the impression that it never made it to it 's deserved ranking ( and never will ) , because of it 's simplicity . this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers . pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines , because this is in no way necessary in this particular case . anyway in order to fulfill this request , i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting : not that it is bad but it could have been done much better . exception made for kevin kline who was perfect . go ahead and watch it .
john cassavetes ' `` opening night '' is fantastic and fascinating ; fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination , fascinating because it never ceases surprising us . with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes , anyone who appreciates characters wo n't be able to take their eyes off the screen . the story of an unstable actress , myrtle gordon , ( gena rowlands ) trying to put herself together for a play , fighting her demons ; `` opening night '' is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world . all of cassavetes ' characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater ; so half of the film takes place on a stage , either where the performers do their job or at backstage , where producers and writers and directors do their job . cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience , but the audience in the cinema . because there is another audience , in the theater of the film , that does n't know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance . and that 's essentially what it is ; it 's just that the audience in the theater does n't get to see 'backstage ' the way we do . they do n't experience gena rowlands ' exuberance before she goes out to that stage , but most importantly ; they do n't know the reasons why she acts the way she does . i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor . myrtle ( rowland ) says she 's an actress and that 's the only thing she knows how to do ; and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer , it would be really difficult to tell when he 's saying the truth because i would know he 's an actor and he can fake anything at any time . a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her through we suspect if she 's being real ; the rest of the characters suspect too . there is the writer , sarah ( joan blondell ) , who ca n't understand why myrtle does n't understand the character she 's written for her . there 's the director , manny ( ben gazzara ) , who ca n't accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it ; the producer david ( paul stewart ) who does n't know where to stand and myrtle 's co-star maurice ( cassavetes himself ) , who ca n't deal with the love they have for each other . when she witnesses the death of a teenager , a fan ; all of this comes together and affects myrtle , but no one knows if her delusions are for real . they do n't say anything because they do n't want to upset her , but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts . at times , we can tell that everyone has had it . during these moments , cassavetes ' brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage ; and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them . here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking , just like cassavetes ' way of making cinema . and in this aspect , the performances are more important here than in `` shadows '' , because the characters are involved in a bigger picture ; a bigger story that steps out of the trivial . but in another aspect , the actual way of making cinema , this movie is no different from `` shadows '' . there 's a beautiful thing in the way al ruban 's camera shoots the characters . when someone 's talking , the camera does n't focus on him , it shoots the person who is listening ; so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one 's saying . sometimes they do n't care , sometimes they are happy , sometimes devastated . improvisation might still be there , though , among all these wonderful performances . near the end , there 's an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking , non-stop . whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder . we have just got to watch ; and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it shows it does n't get more natural than that .
i always feel strange and guilty saying it ( because i 'm a fairly well-educated non-teenager ) , but i actually sort of like the olsen twins , and i respect the movies they make , even though i 've never really been their target audience . `` when in rome '' was a traditional mary-kate and ashley movie , complete with the foreign travel , accents , motorbikes , adult romance as a `` b '' storyline , fashion orientation , and even the gag reel over the credits . i enjoyed myself . `` when in rome '' and the other olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they 're not ; most of the time , they only premiere on video , and they never claim to be the next `` citizen kane '' or even `` an affair to remember . '' my point is , people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another olsen twin movie will be disappointed . that said , those who are fans of the olsen twins will really enjoy themselves . for those of us who 've watched them since the first episodes of `` full house , '' it 's really great to see them growing into more mature roles . this movie provides important historical and geographical information , just like many of their other movies ( remember 10 downing street from `` winning london '' and the visit to the louvre from `` passport to paris '' ? ) as well as providing good , clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family . as long as i still feel like i 'm on my soapbox , and as long as i can make it relevant to the movie , let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the olsen twins : in order to be a fan of the olsen twins , you do n't have to be some pre-teen `` valley girl '' from california . in fact , that 's not really the target audience . if it were , the mk & a fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through gap or some store like that , not wal-mart . `` when in rome , '' while it does feature `` high fashion '' and globe-trotting and two girls from a valley in cali , is n't really about that ... it 's more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places . if that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes , so be it . that 's called marketing -- you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing . at least they 're sending a good message , even if the means seem a little superficial . basically , do n't knock the film until you 've seen it , and then do n't knock it until you 've tried to understand what the olsen twins do : they encourage young girls to be creative , intuitive , and driven young women . this movie does that , i think , just like their others . kids - enjoy . parents - do the same . if you like the olsen twins , you wo n't be disappointed .
this long episode packs amount of astounding of surprises , thriller , mystery and concerns about a battle of wits of sherlock against charles augustus milverton , a master blackmailer . this is an excellent overlong runtime of jeremy brett-holmes series . in the film appear usual holmes 's cannon as inspector lestrade and mrs hudson , though no moriarty , however is a greatest villain , charles augustus . it 's a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue , thrills , and suspense , including an exciting final twist . this is a particular sherlock movie but we find to holmes falling in love with a servant , kissing , crying and even robbing . this time along with the episode ¨scandal in boheme¨ with irene adler , result to be the only one which holmes is enamored . top-notch brett performance , he alongside peter cushing are the best sherlock tv , while in the cinema is forever basil rathbone . brett performs as a resolutive , headstrong , impetuous sleuth . here doctor watson is n't a comic , botcher , and clumsy pal personified by nigel bruce , but is an astute and cunning partner well incarnated by edward hardwicke , a perfect counterpoint of brett . casting is frankly magnificent , special mention to robert hardy as astute nasty . hardy , today famous by role as cornelius fudge in harry potter , is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with several success such as , the 10th kingdom and winston churchill . furthermore appear secondaries actors with terrific performances , nickolas grace , sophie gordon , serena gordon , among others . the movie gets a colorful atmosphere , the london streets and 221 baker street 's house are well designed . the motion picture is well directed by peter hammond , director of various episodes . it 's a must see for the arthur conan doyle fans .
aim for the top ! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it . i totally loved this series , and to this day , it remains my favorite anime . and while it was not gainax 's first animated product , it was their first ova series . mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970 's sports drama aim for the ace ( ace o nerae ! ) , gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 , when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father , who was killed in mankind 's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with . it is because of her father 's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot . but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters . her friend , kazumi amano , even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot . however , noriko 's coach , koichiro ota , has faith in her . and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot , for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko 's father was killed . other characters include jung-freud , a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to , smith toren , a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together , and kimiko higuchi , noriko 's childhood friend . kimiko 's involvement is also of interest , as while noriko is off in space , kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life . and because of the acts of time dilation , kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school . by the end of the series , noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fifties . all in all , this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation . if you like hideaki anno 's other shows , or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto 's artwork , then give this show a chance . it will grow on you .
excellent show . instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it 's the same old thing , just different `` stars '' , this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations . we have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back , of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on w. shame on global for pulling the plug on this one . i thought this one would be a winner . let 's be realistic about things , few canadian shows make it . everyone i talk to enjoys this show and i believe it was foolish of global to walk away . i guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the states instead of pulling behind a canadian made show that had a lot of promise . do n't get me wrong , i enjoy a lot of shows on tv , but , come on people , let 's keep the variety . this unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships , with unique characters that you do n't see on any sitcoms today or in the past . too bad that global had to say no to this one , foolish mistake .
city hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country , state or any sort of major political table . granted it shines on new york city which is a huge political arena , especially nowadays , but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor 's right hand . director harold becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done mercury rising , malice , and domestic disturbance and i think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault . i mean city hall is meant to be a political drama , not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out ... what else ... or rather who else ... al pacino . the film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city . as the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss , and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city . as events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up . i absolutely hate talking about al pacino . i mean even if once he did n't give a good performance how could i ever say it ? the man is acting royalty . there is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor . in city hall pacino plays the new york city mayor . he has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician . he also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches i 've ever seen at the 'james bone ' funeral . i re-watched that speech four times and the first time i watched pacino give it , my mouth gaped open and i almost wanted to stand up and applaud . its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by pacino . john cusack , who i really do enjoy as an actor , turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy mayor kevin calhoun . he is kind of the focus of the film and him and pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance ... he seems like he 's trying too hard . his accent is just bizarre , and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he does n't get seem to pull it off . maybe he was having an off film . bridget fonda , on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows marybeth cogan . her performance is very similar to cusack 's in that she just does n't seem to find her groove with this character . danny aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia frank anselmo . martin landau makes a decent cameo as judge under scrutiny walter stern . the problem with city hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors . everyone is ... okay . there is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy . and of course you have al pacino in a rather small supporting role but he 's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film . it almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them . so city hall could have been this huge political epic drama/thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one but it still has to be seen for pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics . if you just wo n't see this movie than find pacino 's speech at james bone funeral because the word electrifying does n't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes al pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it . if you 're a john cusack fan which i am ... he 's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice . a decent movie but unfortunately potential loss . 7.5/10
a lot is dated in this episode ( just like most twilight zone episodes ) , such as the woman 's incredibly sexist military `` uniform . '' and some things are so unbelievable , like the easy availability of clean water . still , consider the year this was made and the time , and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch . it has a nice sense of hope , something missing from a lot of twilight zones , as well as an interesting female character ( despite the fact that she rarely speaks ) , something else rare on the twilight zone . `` two '' is a great example of how the twilight zone , in just over 20 minutes , could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today . and it 's great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers .
a lot of people do n't think branagh 's hamlet film is all that good , but i must admit i think it is splendid . like virtually every production of shakespeare , it has problems and it has had to make hard choices , not all of which work out . the thing about the `` secret doors everywhere '' , for instance , simply does n't work . that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to , which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming . this is the biggest problem with this production . and while it 's a biggie , i 'm also inclined to say that it 's the only problem . almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully . all right , so branagh is a mite too old for the title role . and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced . and he gets too hysterical at times . but that 's it . no other complaints . even with these faults , i think this version is a seminal one , and if it 's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be , it 's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be . we get the complete text of the longest version of the play , innovatively and expensively brought to the screen , mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with . but in a staging of shakespeare , it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language . for that , one must delve into the print versions of the plays . all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic ( incl . jack lemmon ) . julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever , and even the american actors are astounding , esp . charlton heston as the player king - who would have thought it ? ! ( a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage , and when a critic in the front row could n't stand his hammy acting and said out loud , `` this is terrible ! `` , heston reportedly retorted right from the stage : `` well , i did n't write this crap ! '' of course it may not be true , but it 's a funny story - and if true , a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here . ) robin williams as `` young ozric '' is perhaps not young enough for the part , but he makes it a comical one , which is warranted . overall it is a very well-produced version , with most of the key scenes being , to my mind , supremely memorable . of course , i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare ( and around the same time as luhrmann 's formidable romeo+juliet ) , and it made a great impression on me , which must account for some of my fondness for it . all things considered , i must pronounce branagh 's hamlet to be my favorite one , with derek jacobi 's 1980 bbc version a close second . i probably like branagh 's shakespeare work more than most , finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer , with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text . in the world of shakespeare acting , the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh , and while olivier is the superior actor , branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice , and transforms it into churlish , easy-going , populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity . branagh , i believe , brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seen . and so , 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet .
the booth puts a whole new twist on your typical j-horror movie . this movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story . the director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks . the story is about perception of the people who works , lives , and loves of our protagonist , and how he perceives the people who surrounds him in an antiquated radio station dj booth . the story peels back the layers of the main character like an onion in flash-backs as the movie runs its course , and from it we learned that things are not always the way it seems . the movie mostly took place in a small , out-dated radio station 's studio with a very bad history , where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station was in the process of re-locating . it is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid . at time our protagonist can not determined the strange happenings in the old studio were caused by ghost or some conspiracy by his co-workers or it was all in his mind . what i like about this film is that the film-makers makes you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you just as paranoid as protagonist did . this movie is a very smart , abide rather short 76 minutes film .
hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr. sebastian caine ( kevin bacon ) finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum . they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly , caine & his team of assistant 's celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human . he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible , however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible . the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works , caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory . but then again he 's invisible right , he can do anything he wants ... directed by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man . you know it 's just after christmas , i saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick , not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop i 've had over the past week so i 'll keep this one brief . the script by andrew w. marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise , it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man ( 1933 ) film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit . it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror , sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes . i thought the character 's were ok , i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think it 's generally known that verhoeven does n't deal in subtlety , the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification 'who 's going to know ' that caine says to himself . then of course there 's the gore , he shows a rat being torn apart & that 's just the opening scene after the credits , to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it . having said that i love horror/gore/exploitation films so hollow man delivers for me , it 's just that it might not be everyone 's cup of tea . director verhoeven does a great job , or should that be the special effects boys make him look good . the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless , their brilliant & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . there 's some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top . i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins , organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla . there 's a few gory moments including a rat being eaten , someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results . with a staggering budget of about $ 95,000,000 hollow man is technically faultless , i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacon 's entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position would n't they ? the acting was ok , bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy . hollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character 's but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film , well i know i do . good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product , definitely worth a watch .
anthony mann 's westerns with jimmy stewart are slowly gaining for that director a position with john ford and howard hawks as the best film director in that genre . he certainly knows how to give dimension to nice guy stewart - in mann 's films there is an edge to jimmy that is slowly demonstrated to the audience . in winchester '73 it was the relationship of stewart to his brother and how it twists him into a figure of vengeance . here it is a `` i trust only myself '' attitude , which leads to one complication after another . even before the film properly begins he ( as jeff webster ) kills two of his hired cowboys who were helping on a cattle drive to seattle because of some dispute ( we never are clear about it - either they wanted to leave the cattle drive , or they tried to steal the cattle ) . he meets his match in skagway , the port he has to get to in order to take his herd to dawson . skagway 's boss is a so-called law man named gannon ( john mcintyre ) who reminds one of the real boss of skagway in the `` gold rush '' jefferson `` soapy '' smith and judge roy bean . the problem is that neither smith nor bean would have gotten quite as sleazy as gannon in turning every opportunity into a chance to make some money . stewart 's herd interrupted a public hanging - so ( as a penalty fine ) the herd is confiscated ( to be sold later for gannon 's profit ) . stewart is partner with ben ( walter brennan - who oddly enough won his last oscar playing judge roy bean ) . they are also joined by rube morris ( jay c. flippen ) and also meet two women , the sophisticated rhonda castle ( ruth roman ) and the friendly and helpful renee vallon ( corinne calvert ) . rhonda works closely with gannon , but had helped jeff earlier in fleeing the authorities in seattle . however , she has a similar `` i only trust myself '' attitude to jeff . she does offer him employment to get supplies for herself to dawson . he , ben , and rube go but at night ( while the others are asleep ) they go back and steal back their cattle . renee follows and warns them that gannon and his associates are following . jeff holds off gannon long enough for the cattle herd to be brought over the canadian border , although gannon points out that since jeff has to return by way of skagway gannon can wait until he does to hang him . the reunited party of rhonda and jeff split over the trail to take to dawson , jeff opting for a longer and safer route . after he is proved right , they go by his route and reach dawson only to find there is a lawless element threatening the community due to the gold fields . the herd is sold to rhonda , and jeff , ben , rube , and renee start prospecting . there is soon two groups in the town of dawson . one led by connie gilchrist and chubby johnson want to build a decent town . but the mounties wo n't be setting up a station in dawson for months . the other , centering around the `` dancehall '' run by rhonda , are in cahoots with gannon who has a vast claim jumping scheme using his gang of gunslingers ( robert j. wilke - really scary in one sequence with chubby johnson and jay c. flippen , jack elam , and harry morgan ) . jeff wishes to steer clear of both , and head with his new wealth and ben for a ranch they want in utah . but will they get there ? and will jeff remain neutral ? the performances are dandy here , including stewart as a man who is willing to face all comers , but would otherwise be peaceful enough . brennan is playing one of his patented old codgers , whose love of good coffee has unexpectedly bad results . flippen is a drunk at first , but tragedy and responsibility shake him into a better frame of mind - and one who has a chance to verbally stab stewart in the heart using stewart 's own words against him . mcintyre would achieve stardom on television in wagon train replacing ward bond , but his work in mann 's films show his abilities as a villain ( such as his trade post opportunist who outsmarts himself in winchester '73 ) . he is , as is said elsewhere on this thread , really sleazy - but he has a sense of humor . roman is an interesting blend of opportunist and human being , whose fate is determined by her better feelings . and calvert is both a voice of conscience and a frontier `` gigi '' aware that she is more than a young girl but a budding woman . best of all is the canadian rockies background - as wonderful in its way as the use of monument valley by john ford . mann certainly did a first rate job directing this film , and the viewer will appreciate the results .
sly 's best out and out action film . it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters , solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured . stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes . this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90 's , a definite genre classic . as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories . plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form . action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film . the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner , michael rooker and john lithgow . * * * *
in a word ... amazing . i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan . i was so totally wrong . pinjar is a heart-wrenching , emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws . i was haunted by it after watching it . it lingered on my mind for so long ; the themes , the pain , the loss , the emotion- all was so real . this is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays . it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story . here , no one country is depicted as good or bad . there are evil indians , evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis . the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful ( thanks to gulzar sahib ) and haunting . everything about the movie was amazing ... and the acting just took my breath away . all were perfectly cast . if you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie ... look no further . this movie gives it all . i recommend it with all my heart . amazing can not describe how excellent it is .
whether this movie is propaganda or not ( i firmly believe it is not ) , it really shows the power of media . the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is . it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened , the chavez way of seeing it . although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film , i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate . the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup , the neo-liberal side . this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it . call it propaganda , i say it 's a judgment call on your part .
i really do n't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie ! remember folks , this is an snl movie , not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction ! the ladies man is a hilarious movie , albeit stupid at times , with a wacked-out cast and , as usual , wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows . yes some of the jokes are stupid , and yes , the characters are unbelievable but its comedy ! i really do n't understand how anyone could n't laugh a lot during this hilarious film . anyway , all i ask is that people take this as it is -- an snl , silly and irreverent comedy . nothing that will win awards , but nonetheless , some modern comedy gold . `` 10-4 apricot ! ''
there are some comments about this film that say that it is a bad and silly one and such an excellent actor as pierre fresnay should not have accepted to act in it . i think , just the opposite , that , even when the film is strange and has some weaknesses , the performance of pierre fresnay is so formidable that it converts the film in something excellent . his performance is probably the best in history . the film itself has a very polemic scene about the consecration of wine in the cabaret . for somebody who does not believe that a priest  even a defrocked one  can convert it in christ 's blood , the scene is perhaps bizarre . but for somebody who has been raised in a catholic framework , it is very emotive even if quite unpleasant . the scene of the death of the younger priest is tremendously shocking . but it is very well acted . pierre fresnay turns the crazy act of murder in something understandable within the temporal madness of his character , the tortured defrocked morand who , in this terrible way , comes back to his duty .
this is a very difficult movie , and it 's almost impossible to get a handle on what 's going on . at first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy ( trelkovsky ) who needs an apartment and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant ( a woman ) commits suicide . then the twists and turns start . are the neighbors trying to kill him ? and why are the dead tenant 's clothes turning up in the apartment ? one wonders , finally , if trelkovksy _is_ the prior tenant . spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler one of the tricks polanski pulls on us is to lie to us . we assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality . we assume when the camera is showing us things from its omniscient point of view that we see actuality - but polanski has the camera lie to us .
the movie is great , like every other international project that includes strong impressions . three of them ( israel , bosnia and egypt ) should 've been cut out . especially bosnian clip , which is pathetic beyond all reason , and does n't contain a single original thought or element on it 's own . everything else is really great , unrecognizable for most of americans , known for the rest of the world . unfortunately , clips speak about misery of the people all over the world . and , as i see it , there are so many of those who wo n't give a damn about it ... top 5 : 1. loach 2. penn 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5. imamura
of the elements that make this the best at this point , i have to say # 1 is christine mcintire . shemp 's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent . i imagine that , as one poster suggested , christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene , but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil , to be smiling at shemp 's possibly dying . another character who helps this stand out is the goon . his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball . hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or , for that matter anywhere . i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this , but hey , when a short is this good , who 's going to complain . not i .
i love cartoons . they can show things that films with 'real ' actors and scenery can not - though computer effects are changing that more and more . they can push the boundaries of satire ( 'the simpsons ' ) , good taste ( 'south park ' ) , spectacle ( 'aladdin ' ) , or reality ( 'toy story ' ) . there are some good examples of this in 'ice age ' , such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside , chatting like old friends . such scenes are a pleasure to watch , as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time , usually in a way that makes us laugh . while ice age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time , it 's a really fun film . sit back , enjoy the deliberate anachronisms , the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs . the story follows manfred the grumpy mammoth , sid , an idiotic sloth , and diego , a sabretooth tiger , as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons . on the way , naturally , they have a whole lot of problems . also popping up throughout the journey is scrat , history 's unluckiest rodent , who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter : in glaciers , on top of dead trees , in ice-caves . his opening scene is a classic . it 's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in , but some of the scenes , such as the nappy-changing or the dodos , are hilarious , the animals are likeable and it looks good . there is one quite touching moment too , when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of manfred 's eyes . not a must-see , but good for a fun hour or so . 7/10
tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did . it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years . no grant character transformations , no hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic . the balance , in speed , in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed . this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was . the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied . the fact that this film is about nothing , merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters , makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining , it is brilliant because it is empty . in between the lines it is happening . to see or not to see , that 's the ?
superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit , absurdness and serbian mentality . movie is a great comedy , enjoyable , interesting , unpredictable . best point in a film : characters , then humor itself , story and dialogs . humor has 'inner development ' , rare in serbian movies . so , it is consequence of characterization , is well motivated , spontaneous and cogent . also it is sharp , intelligent and lucid . most of the movies , unfortunately , had constructed humor ( devise a joke and put it into a characters 's mouth ) or ordinary situation comedy , burlesque , farce . some of the 'art immortality ' are incorporated in this movie . little masterpiece , hardly reachable .
two thirds of nearly 2,000 imdb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 , 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes ( was this a record , or merely a faulty vcr ? ) . although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination . but for some reason i imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it . my mind was changed by elizbeth von arnim 's original book . my wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form . such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things , but i gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing , although in no way syrupy , and was also very well written . i realised my wife would enjoy watching the film , and so decided to buy her the videotape . i am now very glad that i did , and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-mussolini italian atmosphere . the story is set in the immediate post ww1 period and starts with two married london ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together , away from their families , in a rented villa in italy . force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds . its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses , not only between these four very disparate mature ladies , but also with the occasional male visitor . if you want action , thrills , dramatic sex scenes , natural or man-made disasters , or harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you . but imdb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch , and if you care to give it a try you may , as i did , come to rank it among your much loved films . it is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which i am already familiar . in many cases i find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film , but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that i actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book , effectively unrolled before my eyes . ( perhaps italy itself has some part in this , the last time i had this experience was when i was watching tales from boccaccio 's decameron on tv . ) generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal , but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events . this works very well , although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story . great credit is due to the director , mike newell , and all members of the cast , particularly those well known british actresses who play the four principal ladies .
`` cut '' is a full-tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do . most of the standard slasher cliches are there ; the old creepy house , the woods , the anonymous indestructible serial killer , buckets of gore , and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they 're having sex ( that 's hardly a spoiler ) . the set-up is simplicity itself : film-school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher `` masterpiece '' , unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast . this also neatly - okay , messily - disposes of kylie minogue in the first reel . they are joined by one of the survivors of the original film , played by molly ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines . the rest of the cast fit their roles well , especially the lovely jessica napier , who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her . there are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments , and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace . it also has an appropriate low budget look , including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate . good soundtrack , too . if there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send-up of or a homage to the slasher genre . probably a bit of both .
if i remember , ira gershwin , the lyricist and brother of george , offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers . in many respects , it was a typical 50 's movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kelly . the gershwins were , of course , among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but , in my opinion , george himself was among the greatest of all american composers , period ! ! ! gene kelly was , of course , one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical ( one guess as to the other ? ) and i do n't imagine his casting was ever in doubt . but , i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation : oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and , as an actual friend of george gershwin , he had to be in this film . he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here , as always , he plays himself . leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french `` gamin '' type . a talented dancer , she was never a real beauty . george guétary who plays the part of maurice chavalier , oops , i mean henri baurel , was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the part . gene 's hoofer 's voice is serviceable here but guétary has much the better vocal equipment . though gene was better cast elsewhere as , obviously , in `` singin ' in the rain '' where his character is much more calculating , even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times ( he was , not for nothing , cast as the original heel joey in pal joey , the broadway musical . ) i was not so enchanted with his `` i got rhythm '' scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion . i also found nina foch 's character milo to be rather irritating . but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist painters . i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar , as struggling artists , and i do n't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but , on balance , the gershwin music is very well served in this film . the dvd is well-done with fine clear graphics ( when they are supposed to be ) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow .
diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now . the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today 's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side . the way mark 's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking , and if you think you do , you are wrong . diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics , not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives . everything from racism and adoption , to terrorists and technology . as for it being for old people ? i am 24 ! ! i do n't think i can be classed as old yet . i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd ( not ntsc ) so that i can watch them all in order . they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit !
i have seen maslin beach a couple of times - both on free to air tv in brisbane . i wo n't go into whether it is good , bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this . i will say that it is so australian . only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born , and to view it on free commercial television . i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country . sex and the city and huff are just too examples . despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state , it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie
as usual , sean connery does a great job . lawrence fishburn is good , but i have a hard time not seeing him as ike turner .
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie.how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing . so many people only care about what they want , and fuss about all the things they do n't have . and they are such small things , like chothes , money a new car . i 've seen people in tears because of a blemish . this movie brings everything back to the basics . love , hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life.it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are small and really unimportant . you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food , a roof over your head and your loved ones around you .you are truly blessed.and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning.and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith , strenght , and humor with me .thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above .
this is an absolutely charming film , one of my favourite romantic comedies . it 's extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful . though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre . he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor , who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways , to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly . the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting . ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well . i highly recommend it .
this film is harmless escapist fun . something the recent tomb raider film lacked . i ca n't wait to get the dvd . how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know . anything with karen kopins in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two !
* spoiler alert : i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points , but i ca n't . sorry . * i was looking for an imdb review of the george c. scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version . it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though : ( a ) while truncated and rushed , i thought george c. scott embodied the tortured nature ( and physical appearance ) of the book 's rochester to a t ; and ( b ) even while looking at the dvd 's cover , i was thinking `` is n't timothy dalton too good-looking for the role ? '' the latter concern was reinforced by the fact that i decided to re-read the book while the dvd was on backorder . that said , the minute i started watching this , i was captivated . at first it was disconcerting to hear 1840 's dialog spoken as written -- with little or no attempts at modernization -- but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly , that i actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech . to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus . i know someone who wo n't watch any versions of jane eyre because `` who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic ? '' frankly , if someone who had n't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions , they would think that 's pretty much all the story entails -- rochester 's secret and its affect on everyone around him . luckily , this version is actually about jane eyre 's whole life . some people have criticized the casting . dalton is too dashing ; clarke is too reserved . i ca n't argue against the first point , but he is so `` in the moment '' that i believe he is rochester . to me , clarke 's performance is on the mark . jane eyre is quiet , guarded . if one remembers the book , so much of the adult jane 's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles . some of the criticisms baffle me . reviewers say clarke is too short or is n't pretty enough . the book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain jane is . ms. clarke should n't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane 's declarations of her lack of beauty credible . she can scarcely help it if dalton is tall . some say there is no chemistry between the leads . what ? ! ! the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret -- and that 's just the first example that comes to mind . i do agree with some of the other criticisms . i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings . some of the dialog was oddly truncated . when rochester declares , `` jane , you misjudge me . i do not hate her because she is mad , '' i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad , he would still love and care for her . it 's a powerful moment in the book , and i wish it had been included . i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own . it might have been done for clarity 's sake , but i found it jarring . i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane opines that rochester 's ardor will cool and he 'll become gruff again , but he may `` like '' her again by and by . dalton 's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring -- when rochester weeps in the library , i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene , not as rochester . as for the sets , if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960 's show `` dark shadows , '' one knows what to expect -- very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors . others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make-up job rochester sports at the end . yikes ! it is bad . the conclusion is too abrupt . after all that anguish and suspense , i wanted a more rounded off ending . and , on my copy of the dvd , having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25-30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much . that said , i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again .
when i was a kid , i totally loved both bill & ted movies . the other night , bogus journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since i last saw it , i decided to tune in . and i loved it all over again ! this film is still funny after all those years . 'excellent adventure ' is better , but this one rocks just the same . sure , some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy , but hey , this entire film is cheesy in a cool way . plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie ! concluding : totally like non bogus movie dude ! way excellent ! station ! ! !
wow , it 's been years since i last saw this movie . watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 . initially i did n't ' think i would make it through the movie . hunt stevenson ( michael keaton ) was so obnoxious , arrogant and disrespectful that i found it hard to watch him . he embodied every negative stereotype of americans . if that was n't bad enough , once the small american town 's finest workers were shown the image only got worse . on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as emotionless , robotic workaholics . the movie was n't even all that funny , i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it . and i 'm glad i continued the watch . just like boxing , judges are swayed by how you finish the round . this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending . the end was excellent . you always want a harmonious ending and this was just that . it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory , but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values . it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note .
a great story , based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road . being that this is denzel washington 's first ever movie that he himself was gon na direct , i have to admit i was a tad sceptical , but who would n't be .. ? but then again , he 's a great actor with plently of years of experience , and the end result turned out great . the story is told in a great way , making you that has had difficulties during your childhood , and young adulthood , see yourself in those situations . so , it hits you hard , letting you know your not the only one going through hell . in all , a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f * * * ed up world . ( the story is based on the life of antwone fisher , born 3 . august 1959 , cleveland , ohio , usa , whom was also the writer of this movie ) strongly recommended . 8/10
i do n't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets , this movie rocks ! excellent movie , has it all , great music ( prince of coarse ! ) , romance , and drama . this is really a very sad movie , very moving . i do n't want to say to much more , i ; m not into giving away the plot , but i will say this-the film is very realistic , there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems , so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film . i see this as being very realistic and being so real , makes the movie that much more moving . my generation loved this movie growing up , so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems . that said , it 's definetly not just a movie for teens , id recomend it to all age groups . and it 's not all so dark , the movie has some great music , band performance scenes , and sexy fun scenes between prince and appelonia .
this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time . the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i ca n't not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni . i love them both . their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there . the husband , in his brief role , is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but , in his own way , a loving father . the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically . i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it is n't more renowned .
my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg-1 which are wonderfully fresh , creative and addicting . when the cast stepped through the gate , you never knew what lay on the other side ! starting around season 5 , the show took a different focus - still good , but different . the series follows the adventures of a team of humans ( and one alien ) who regularly venture into a planetary transport device called the `` stargate '' . the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie `` stargate '' in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt . the episodes are light ( innocent and easy to watch ) and very creative . many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci-fi movies of their own . what happens next was always unpredictable . the characters on which the show rests are also well-defined and brilliantly performed . their tone is serious , but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor . they are simply fun to watch . starting somewhere around season 5 , the series started to evolve into a continuing storyline based on fighting a single foe ( the goa'uld , then the ori ) . the plots become more complex ( a lot more political/strategic oriented ) and interdependent . the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature . one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes . they are simply can't-miss shows . they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons . if you are a sci-fi fan , watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you 'll likely be hooked . if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides , you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to .
the boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear `` the voice of an angel . '' that would be miss van doren , auditioning and going under the name of miss andrews because her father does n't approve of her being a `` radio singer '' . however , she hopes a certain big-wig , mrs. bixby , a friend of her dad 's will hire her , and then he will have to give his approval . she leaves but within minutes the boys are running amok in the studio causing havoc and having other musicians out to kill them after they ruin the recording session . finally things calm down . `` whew , we eluded them , '' says moe . `` yeah , we got away , too , '' answers curly . the boys then fool around in the studio , put on miss van doren 's record and curly gets dressed in women 's clothes and pretends he 's singing . mrs. bixby walks in , is impressed and hires `` seniorita cucacha '' on the spot ! for an extra $ 500 , she 's asked to come and sing at their high-society party that night . the rest , as they say , is history as curly pretends to be an opera singer with some funny results . oh , by the way , he accompanied by `` senior mucho '' and `` senior gusto . '' what happens at the party is simply that the truth wins out , but not before a few slapstick antics take place . in all , a pretty good episode . i enjoyed it but would n't rate it as anything special .
first , an explanation : despite my headline , i 'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made . all the criticisms registered here have valid points . also , be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon 's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter . he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue -- especially dry , jewish , love-suffused sarcasm -- and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love , then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie . so much for warnings . here 's my main point : walter matthau is flat-out perfect , even beyond perfect , in this movie . i have never seen him funnier , or more touching for that matter -- because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline , he also shows us the more vulnerable , maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch . and he only barely shows us that sad part -- it 's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father 's or husband 's mental decline right now ( i mention this as a warning ) , but artistically , it 's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots i 'm seen in possibly any film performance . this is beyond method acting -- matthau 's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery . this is a masterpiece of comic acting . about richard benjamin : i personally find his acting annoying in general , and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here . ( `` chicken is funny .... '' is one of them . ) so if you like him , you should like him here , and if you do n't this movie wo n't change your mind . about the 1976 oscars ... i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in `` cuckoo 's nest '' that year . it was a killer year for leading-actor competition ; if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama , then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for `` dog day afternoon '' and to walter matthau for `` the sunshine boys '' -- not to dis jack 's fine work as mcmurphy , but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year . also , i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance -- i mean , he was good in this movie , but not that good . ( burns 's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat brad dourif 's truly brilliant debut in `` cuckoo 's nest , '' not to mention chris sarandon 's stunning debut in `` dog day afternoon '' -- which i think proves my theory . ) oscar theories aside , here 's my bottom line review : if you like matthau 's comic acting , then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures , fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides . ( but if you 're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip , then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now . )
i had watched ( and recorded ) this a few years back on local tv and , having been underwhelmed by it , i subsequently erased the tape ; however , when it was released by mgm as part of a `` midnite movie '' double-feature dvd of curtis harrington/shelley winters films for a very affordable price , i could n't resist giving it a second look ( this has since gone out-of-print ) . actually , i received the dvd a few months ago but only now , with harrington 's passing , did i get to it ; thankfully , this time around i was more receptive to the film and , in fact , now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane ? ( 1962 ) imitations ( with whom , incidentally , it shared screenwriter henry farrell ) . the film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s depression america - with its child-star craze and sensational murders ( exploited during the fake newsreel opening ) ; it 's stylishly made ( kudos to lucien ballard 's cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie ' ) and boasts an effective david raksin score . shelley winters , debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances ; the latter is especially impressive as the larger-than-life and vaguely sinister diction coach ( though he ultimately proves a mere red herring ! ) . also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead ( hers is only a cameo , really , as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio ) . many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids ( including an amusing mae west imitation ) , but i personally was n't bothered by them ; the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and ( perhaps needlessly ) convoluted plot . reynolds - a musical star herself - is ideally cast as the dancing-school owner and , despite their on-set rivalry , she and winters work well together . the latter , in fact , gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo ? ( 1971 ) ; the narrative , then , comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignol-type denouement . apparently , the film was toned down ( it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism ! ) by producer martin ransohoff - against harrington 's wishes - in order to get a pg rating ...
excellent film . the whole picture was filmed in budapest , so i feel proud . my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways ( máv ) , and it is plain to see that they were used in big train , not in the local railway - according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations . apart from this , the film is superb .
these are one of the movies that do n't require any brain or thinking , it 's a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so . i was really surprised with john abraham 's acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless face , so from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfully , by managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar . i was also quite surprised with the akshaye 's 3 girls because there roles do n't require much talent but mostly moaning about akshaye 's dissapearence ( to the other girls ) i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing , also majority of songs are good , it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood .
this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action . what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated . it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around , her movements were done so well . why do n't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days ? it 's quite effective . fire and ice , in it 's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women , was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways , her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy . some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy , others ( including plenty of women ) will adore it 's esthetic quality . i for sure did not mind ! bakshi just loves animating lushious , voluptuous babes , as can also be seen in cool world , and i do n't think he has to apoligize since it 's pretty much animation for adults . but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it . this one was just special , so different from the standard disney or anime fare , and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it 's possibly bakshi 's finest . for those who like animations with lushious women : try space adventure cobra as well . i give fire and ice 8 out of 10 .
may contain minor spoilers . dressed to kill , having just seen it for the first time the other day , is a movie with some terrific sequences , some decent performances , and a nice , though obvious hitchcock ripoff , plot twist at the end . it 's just too bad certain things , quite obvious , prevent it from being a classic . dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women ( could have been more but the movie never tells us ) , and the search for the killer by three people : a brainy kid whose mom was a victim , a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer , and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid 's mother . there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz , angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller , and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye ; though by no standard is anyone really outstanding . on the other hand denis franz , later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue , is embarrassing as an over-exaggerated , ruthless , hateful detective , though he takes little screen time so it does n't hurt the movie that much . keith gordon , the brain child , is decent , but is almost too smart to really be believable . what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences . the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done , as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death . i also love the sequence at the doctor 's office , that reveals the identity of the killer , which really makes the whole film come together at once . and there 's a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic . still there 's another situation when liz is on a train , running from what may be the killer , that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes . as a thriller it 's tense and quite often believable . as a crime drama it often falters , especially with the incomplete , ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end . there 's also a needless , and way too long , dream sequence at the end , in which they had the audacity to shoot someone 's foot for what seemed minutes at a time . this was an up and down experience ; one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement , and the next would make me squirm and ask why . at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film . scary movie fans should like this . it still stands as a better film than most of today 's slasher flicks . maybe it was a better film in it 's time , but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it , and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone .
actually i liked this movie very , very much . not because of it ` s plot , acting , jokes , no . i liked it , because it ` s one of the worse movies ever created . it ` s so lame , so bad , that it becomes terribly funny . some jokes are actually cool , but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter . `` men in white '' are so dumb and stupid , that you can do only two things . turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing ( beer helps a lot : ) . i chose the second option .
this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the 90s . if you 're looking for a serious film , look elsewhere . however , if you 're looking for some action , a lot of laughs , and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters , this is well worth watching . everyone chews the scenery a bit , but that 's really what the film is all about , and everyone is quite funny . donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together .
if you lived through the 60s , this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous . it 's all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time . these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out : `` do n't speak too soon for the wheel 's still in spin , for the times they are a-changin ' '' . while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and it 's dissemination at the time , that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia , influencing engineers , scientists and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activities . a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there - you 've captured the era better than i 've seen before .
i 'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards ( or sympathy for ! ) sinatra in the other reviews here . i 've read elsewhere that sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for * not * being cast as sky masterson . ok , so who would n't want to be cast as sky masterson ?  it 's a great part : the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet , in which he must take salvation army sargeant sarah brown on a date to cuba , or lose . it 's not the money  it 's the pride , but he and she meet their match . meanwhile nathan detroit must juggle his long-suffering fiancée adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it does n't alienate his fiancée forever first . the film started life as a series of short stories by damon runyon : that 's his unique dialogue you hear , and those are his great character names , and that 's his horse-racing/nightclub/late night gambling world . then it became a musical , and you ca n't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage . the camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably  and not pleasingly  flat and childlike . fortunately the music is so great , i do n't care that much . my absolute favourite thing about this film , though , is the singing and acting of the two non-singers , brando ( as sky ) and jean simmons ( as sargeant sarah brown ) . of course , putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music ; but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead : what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto , acting ability , and pathos , pathos , pathos . you 're with sky as he argues with sarah against reason , steadiness , pipes and safety . you enjoy sarah 's loosening up under the influence of cuban `` milk '' . you feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home . as sky rightly says , it 's `` chemistry '' . pro singers  be they broadway belters or smooth crooners  ca n't necessarily be relied on to make this happen . ( and they certainly did n't . ) i read somewhere that brando criticised sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of nathan detroit . sinatra in turn was infuriated by brando 's four-take acting method . as a brando fan ( does it show ? ! ) i 'm bound to take the other side , but i ca n't imagine that this film would have been the much-adored classic it is today if brando and simmons had n't been in it with their wonderful chemistry ; brando 's unpredictability ; simmons ' face , all pink cheeks and brown hair , drunk and ashamed in a cuban bar . beautiful . i 'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case i need to feel good again . you 'll forgive me if give some of the nathan ( sleep ) talking parts the 100 % brush-off though , wo n't you ? you wo n't ? oh , be quiet and have some more of mindy 's cheesecake !
wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow ( cher ) who 's planning to marry a man she 's comfortable with ( danny aiello ) until she falls for his headstrong , angry brother ( nicholas cage ) . the script is sharp with plenty of great lines , the acting is wonderful , the accents ( i 've been told ) are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful . new york has never looked so good on the screen . a must-see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis -- they 're both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got . a beautiful , funny film . a must see !
the person who wrote the review `` enough with the sweating and spitting already '' has no grasp of what cultural , literary , or psycho- critique is . he dismisses zizek 's interpretations because they do n't seem `` in line '' with what the director originally intended . so what ? the importance of a director 's ( or author 's ) intention is not important in critical theory . this is known as the author 's `` intentional fallacy '' and should be avoided . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intentional_fallacy a text or movie can be analyzed through a number of theories , many of which disagree with one another , as well as completely ignore the author 's intention . this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory . because of this , whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek . in reality , anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guys opinion ( i suggest you should too ) as it is completely off point . that being said ... if you are at all interested in freudian , laconian , or kristevian discourse , this movie is a must . it connects these theories with popular film , making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them .
phantom lady ( 1944 ) dir : robert siodmak production : universal pictures scott henderson ( alan curtis ) , following a nasty fight and split with his wife , looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole . there he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and , looking for some companionship , asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems . she agrees , but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves . sure enough , when scott gets home he finds the police there , waiting to question him . his wife 's been murdered . where were you at 8 o'clock this evening , asks inspector burgess ( thomas gomez ) ? but scott has an alibi , right ? only he does n't know the woman 's name . and the bartender remembers scott but not the woman . neither does the cab driver . nor the drummer ( elisha cook jr. ) at the club . even the dancer at the club , who scott clearly caught looking at the woman ( they were both wearing the same hat ) , wo n't acknowledge there was someone with him . something is going on , but whatever it is scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife 's murder ( on the flimsiest 'evidence ' in hollywood judicial history ) . it 's left to his loyal secretary , 'kansas ' ( ella raines ) , who 's later joined by a sympathetic inspector burgess , to find out the real killer before scott is executed . phantom lady is built on themes that recur , almost compulsively , in woolrich 's work . for example , the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in black angel and the leopard man . additionally , there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in rendezvous in black and the bride wore black . it can leave a viewer feeling like he 's treading on well worn ground . but in the right hands , the feverish plots , sorry dialogue , the narrative inconsistencies , all are beside the point . fortunately , phantom lady was being guided by sound hands . this is siodmak 's first noir . he would go on to distinguish himself as one of the , if not the , preeminent practitioners of the style ( the killers , criss cross ) . here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer woody bredell ( they would be reunited on christmas holiday and the killers ) . there is some great storytelling done in the camera . in one shot , the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror , suggesting multiple personalities . the same character , who is an artist , has van gogh 's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment . but what siodmak and bredell are really doing in phantom lady is practically creating the look for noir . released very early in 1944 , it 's all here ; the wet pavement , the bags of atmosphere and dread , the sharply contrasting b & w , the wildly expressionistic versions of reality ( when kansas visits scott in prison ) , the discordant shafts of light , etc . it is a terrific picture to look at . franchot tone aside , the cast , as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director ( and presumably , the budget ) , suggests ' b ' movie ambitions . i thought tone was a little hammy . alan curtis ( high sierra ) is not up to much , and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes . ella raines is mostly good ( and quite beautiful ) . her 'sex scene ' with elisha cook jr. is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed . another standout scene is when kansas goes after the bartender to question him . it amounts to a chase scene , as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets , with a stop at a subway station . some real good tension in there . * * * out of 4
i 've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered ( especially now that it immediately follows the amazing race , but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i 've seen from the house of bruckheimer . the casting , especially of the younger officers , was spot on , and the script and editing , the soundtrack , and the acting made this episode a tour d'force . if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration . it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode ; that takes a lot of talented people doing their best . i hope there 's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated , because i 'm sure i 'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around .
my favorite jackie chan movie will always be `` drunken master '' ( 1978 ) , followed by this film from 1985 , `` police story . '' in it , chan plays a hong kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang , and is then assigned to protect the man 's girlfriend ( brigitte lin ) so that she can turn state 's evidence . as the story goes on , the gangster sends his goons to dispatch lin , but chan takes matters into his own fists and feet , while keeping girlfriend maggie cheung at bay . like `` drunken master , '' `` police story '' has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that chan has become famous for , climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall . in his role as director , chan exceeds in excellence , giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action . while light on the overall slapstick humor of `` drunken master , '' at heart `` police story '' is just that , a police story , a gritty cop-thriller that would be oft-copied over the years to come . 10/10
put quite simply , this film is terrifying . it starts off simply , looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film . do n't expect gore , or zombies . this is psychological , and just as he would also do in candyman , bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed . each time you watch this film , you realise more about what 's happening , and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect . drawings have never been scarier .
i have previously seen zu : warriors from the magic mountain . in that film , the setting takes place in china 's mountains , the legend of zu looks like another dimension ! ! thank that to tsui hark 's extensive use of cgi effects . he 's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool moon orb . while there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on king sky and enigma . the romance aspect is there , although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor . cecilia cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching . in the beginning , i like how she resembles the countess ( from zu warriors ) and she does well playing enigma as she deals with facing her past life . oh , by the way , did i mention that cecilia 's very appealing to the eye ? ? in truth , zu warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 . tsui hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema .
the people who are bad-mouthing this film are those who do n't understand film to begin with . these are the people who love movie blockbusters and adverse to any movie that does n't star leonardo dicaprio . wilder napalm is a neat little film that may seem quirky and maybe even stupid at first , but what it lacks in plot , it more than makes up for in substance . one thing in particular about the movie that impressed me was it 's use of music , which plays a large part . those students of film music will notice how important music is in the movie , both in vida and wilder 's life , and in the background . wilder 's theme , vida 's theme , and wallace 's theme are all heard in the opening sequence , and it is funny how some of the lyrics play out . for instance , in the scene where the men are singing `` duke of earl '' , vida is with wilder when the men sing something like `` she is my girl '' , and then she goes over to wallace to give him something when the men sing the lyric `` she will be my girl '' cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers there are all sorts of little intricacies like this inside the movie , and while it may look like a flop on the outside , the real student of film will notice how good this movie really is .
when the british film institute asked martin scorcese to create the american part of its century of the cinema series , he grabbed the opportunity with both hands . a personal journey through american movies is a fascinating , wide-ranging and , as the title says , a highly personal look at hollywood cinema . scorcese 's story is primarily about hollywood 's directors  actors , producers , screenwriters and other collaborators barely get a mention . he states right from the beginning that for him the primary conflict within the film industry is that between the director 's vision and the distributor 's profit motive , between art and commercial viability . he even opens with a clip from vincente minnelli 's the bad and the beautiful , one of the earliest films to openly explore this contradiction . this dictates the structure for the documentary . scorcese looks at how genres have darkened and clichés have become challenged , how mavericks have challenged the production code , and how certain filmmakers fell from grace when they dared to be different . however , scorcese never falls into the auteurist trap of dismissing directors who consistently pleased the studio bosses ( he lavishes praise on cecil b . de mille ) , or those who had less of a recognisable style but were master craftsmen of the cinema nonetheless . scorcese does n't necessarily focus on his absolute favourite directors either ( orson welles and alfred hitchcock , two of scorcese 's biggest influences , are only mentioned in passing ) . instead , he looks at the individuals and the films that serve to tell his story . for example , he shows us a succession of john ford films to show how the western evolved . he looks at the work of vincente minnelli ( probably the most often referenced director of the documentary ) to show how a supposedly wholesome genre like the musical could also have darker undercurrents . i can imagine that , had this assignment not been limited to america , scorcese would have also loved to talk about , for example his italian influences or his british hero michael powell . as it is , he stretches the definition of american movies to include both the hollywood films of immigrant directors such as fw murnau , billy wilder and douglas sirk , as well as the work of us-born filmmakers that was produced elsewhere  such as that of stanley kubrick . rather than simply tell the story of hollywood chronologically , scorcese compares films from various eras in order to tackle various subjects . in his section on the language and tools of cinema , he begins with dw griffith , looks at the coming of sound , colour and widescreen and inevitably ends up going over computer generated effects which , although scorcese is not keen on them , he is even-handed enough to include clips of george lucas and francis ford coppola defending them . however , he does n't simply finish the chapter here as if this is the end of it . instead , he then rewinds back to the 1940s , to show how a low-budget horror like the cat people can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest of elements . a personal journey through american movies has to be one of the best film documentaries made . there were a number of outstanding directors and pictures which i would never have discovered without , and even the most seasoned of film buffs would be likely to find something new in its broad scope . scorcese has also restored the balance to forgotten or undervalued pictures . i was pleased to see that , when he talks about kubrick in his `` iconoclasts '' chapter , he looks at lolita and barry lindon , for me his two most underrated films . scorcese 's respect for the medium is on display in the way he allows clips to play out fully , rather than just giving us tiny bits , and he interrupts them with talking heads ( a combination of archive and new interviews ) only when necessary . there is a bit of bias towards the 40s and 50s , but that is hardly surprising since it is the era in which scorcese grew up and discovered cinema . and after all , i do n't think this documentary could have been achieved had it not been a personal journey . one word of warning though , in its in depth look at certain pictures , this documentary does contain a fair few spoilers .
this is an extremely dense , somber , and complicated film that unravels quite slowly , revealing excruciating detail , like the attention paid in a novel , and watching this film `` is '' like watching a novel unfold . while i did n't care for the narrator , as i felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances , this film features some of the best ensemble acting i have ever seen , and the lead , summer phoenix , is fabulous . her innocence and naivete some might find implausible , sort of a cross between cinderella and alice in wonderland . i can buy that critique , but she 's still fabulous , partially because she 's unlike anything i 've ever seen before . this film is unbelievably beautiful , filmed by eric gautier , and part of what is so unique about this film is how it does n't ever show what you 'd expect . it 's always surprising , and despite it 's length , the film never reveals more than it needs to . at 163 minutes , it 's extremely concise , to a fault , i 'd say , which is one of the wonders of this film . it 's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning , some of the best you 're likely to see all year , and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience . the family moments are unique , ian holm is brilliant , and what this film has to say about the theater has n't been seen in films since cassavetes ' `` opening night , '' or perhaps chaplin 's `` limelight . '' but , believe it or not , this film is much `` less '' conventional . i never knew where this film was going , and now , having seen it , it still has multiple possibilities . this is a powerful , incredibly provocative film .
this is a beautiful movie filled with adventure . the genii in the bottle is a classic scene . romantic in it 's finish , all things turn out as they should be . i saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy i wished was true .
it 's this sort of movie that you try and imitate . by attempting to realise something ... then flying through the air almost immediately . i 'd like to do that and i know you would too ! great stuff !
the second of the why we fight series concentrates on hitler 's grab of the sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of neville chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of europe . clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the `` allied bias '' turning out to be historical fact . the fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves east . the czechs and austrians quickly capitulate but the poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds . the disparity between hitler 's military might and chamberlain waving the munich treaty like a white flag , declaring `` peace in our time '' to this day has durable propaganda qualities . here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of world war ll sets in on europe leaving the american viewer with two options , freedom or slavery . in 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and the nazis strike makes its point effectively .
who does n't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio ( the three countries where the french `` bd '' or `` bandes dessinées '' are massively published ) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book , which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels , it had to be adapted on screens . after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show , the real thing begins . first of all , and that 's what most of the fans did n't get , the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series . some essential parts , characters and actions of the original are missing . the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series . as a 1st class-fan of the comic book , i must confess i was nicely surprised . the actors are good , so is the scenario , though it might seem too fast . i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers , but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet .
who would think andy griffith 's `` helen crump '' ( aneta corsaut ) had a steve mcqueen movie in her past ? but that is only one of several weird and wonderful things about the ultimate 1950s teenagers-battle-creatures movie , which might best be described as rebel without a cause meets god knows what from outer space . the rebel is steven mcqueen ( who would shortly decide that `` steve '' sounded less prissy ) , a good boy with just enough wild to be interesting ; the very wholesome yet understanding girlfriend is the aforementioned aneta corsaut . it was bad enough when their date was disrupted by teenage hot-rodders , but they are considerably more nonplussed when they encounter a gelatinous , man-eating what is it that rides down to earth on its own hotrod meteor -- and begins gobbling up townfolk right and left . but will the grown ups believe them ? of course not , what do they know , they 're just kids ! the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best . the actors take the rather pretentious script very seriously , with many a soulful look into each other eyes , and the `` adult '' supporting cast probably says `` kids ! '' very third sentence or so . but the real pleasure of the film its creature , which is well imagined , well-executed , and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense . and although clearly on the cheap side ( check out those miniature sets , guys ! ) , the blob is actually a fairly well-made film -- and there 's that catchy little theme song thrown in for good measure . the 40-plus crowd ( myself included ) will enjoy the movie as nostalgia , but that wo n't prevent them from hooting right along with the younger set at its whole-milk-and-white-bread 1950s sensibility , and the film would be a great choice for either family-movie night or a more sophisticated `` grown ups only '' get together . make plenty of jello cubes for movie snacking ! gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer
this film is amazing - it 's just like a nightmare . the bizarre story , the dark decors , the swarming insects everywhere , the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... really great ! people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic . it seems a little to the films of david lynch : the strange story , the bizarre dreams , the red curtains . nuit noire contains almost no plot . it 's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings , nightmares and meetings . that 's a drawback . if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement , i would give it a 10 out of 10 . but that 's missing , and that 's why i gave the movie an 8 . nuit noire is a film worth watching . search that dvd and you 'll be rewarded !
daniel day-lewis is christy brown , a victim of cerebral palsy who uses `` my left foot '' to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film . the movie also stars brenda fricker as christy 's mother , ray mcanally , fiona shaw and hugh o'conor . their brilliant performances , great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown , an artist and writer who died in 1981 at the age of 49 . brown was born into a lower middle-class catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant ( 22 children in total , 13 of whom survived ) . his father considered christy mentally retarded as well as physically handicapped , but he would not permit his son to go into a home . the children in the family would bid goodbye to him each day as they went off to school , and then his mother would feed him and talk to him . in the movie , fricker conveys the sense of a woman who , despite being surrounded by a huge family , needs someone to talk to . christy does n't talk back . eventually a cart is found for him to ride in , and the neighborhood kids , all of whom have known him since he was a baby , include him in all of their activities . the only part of his body that works really well is his left foot , and when the kids find out how well he kicks , they put him into soccer games for just that purpose . one of the nicest parts of the film is the relaxed way the in which the other children treat him . there are many powerful scenes , but none as powerful as christy writing `` mother '' on the floor holding a piece of chalk between his toes . `` he 's a true brown , '' his father declares , hoisting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the pub . walking into the pub , he announces , `` my son 's a genius . '' things change when christy grows older because he has a young boy 's desires and emotions . he develops crushes , is rejected and goes more into himself , turning to painting . eventually he goes into therapy in a nearby clinic and works with a therapist , eileen ( fiona shaw ) at home . he falls in love with her . when he finds out she 's engaged , he nearly goes crazy . but he survives to live , to paint , to write ( three books in total ) and to love again . because it 's a film , by necessity certain things had to be left out and characters combined . brown was n't actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy for some time , which was left out of the movie . the therapist eileen is actually a combination of three important therapeutic figures in christy 's life , and though we know that his mother believed he had a good mind , in truth , she worked very hard with christy when he was a child teaching him the alphabet , etc . also , before mary , christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman to whom he dedicated `` my left foot . '' and the typical hollywood ending , 9 years before his death where neglect by his wife may have been a factor , does n't finish the story . despite all of that , christy brown 's biopic is incredibly powerful , all the more so because of two performances : hugh o'conor as young christy and daniel day-lewis as the adult christy . o'conor 's facial expression and the way he drags his warped body is gut-wrenching . one is exhausted for him and heartbroken at the same time . and what can be said about daniel day-lewis , one of the greatest actors in the world - he brings christy totally to life , a fully fleshed out , intelligent human being capable of swearing , becoming angry , bitter , drunk , pushy , lecherous , funny and loving . a well-deserved oscar won in the same year that tom cruise was nominated for `` born on the fourth of july . '' i remember someone writing a letter to the editor somewhere that cruise was so sensational , what was wrong with the academy ? uh , nothing for a change . nothing at all . brenda fricker is amazing as christy 's mother , who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who holds her family and husband together during the hard times . the wonderful thing about fricker 's performance is that the support , love and work ethic seem to come naturally to the mother . the character would never consider herself a heroine or as someone doing something out of the ordinary . fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth are to be a good wife and mother . and no matter what , even when her husband is out of work , throws their daughter out of the house for being pregnant , whatever , she manages . she saves money for christy 's wheelchair , she receives photos of her daughter and the baby , she starts building a room for christy in the back of the house . all part of a day 's work . a performance worthy of the oscar she received . brown 's life was more complicated than this inspiring film , but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must-see .
nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls , mischa barton as frankie , and ingrid uribe as hazel , although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination . young hazel running for mayor seems out of place , to be honest . while the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama . perhaps we 've grown to expect gritty reality in movies , rather like comparing pollyanna to how green was my valley ! never mind , each of them are good in their own way . i do admire joan plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here . middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers , and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a rarity ! i find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter , thoughtful values for the growing up years , and no violence thank goodness . a warm family film to enjoy .
even though this was a disaster in the box office , it is my favorite film . it gives a powerful message of family . it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis . compared to other bollywood films , the action scenes in this movie are more realistic . it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan . if you want to see the indian godfather , amitabh portrays that in this film . do n't read reviews by critic , they 're just ignorant . this movie has good mix of comedy , romance , drama , and especially action . so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon na ( still good movie ) , this is the movie .
a bug 's life is a very good animated feature . this movie is for younger children , but it is also a great movie for people my age . the story is about an ant named flik . he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers . he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess . this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie . the animation is brilliant especially for the late 90 's . the story is good , but a little more detail would be suffice . the voice acting is good as with most animation movies . the music is nice to listen to . nothing special , but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories . overall , this movie struck me as awestruck . this is a good movie for all families . i rate this movie 10/10 .
the contaminated man is a good film that has a good cast which includes william hurt , natascha mcelhone , peter weller , katja woywood , michael brandon , nikolett barabas , hendrick haese , désirée nosbusch , arthur brauss , and christopher cazenove.the acting by all of these actors is very good . hurt and weller are really excellent in this film . i thought that they performed good . the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . the movie is filmed very good . the music is good . the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . this is a very good and thrilling film . if you like william hurt , natascha mcelhone , peter weller , katja woywood , michael brandon , nikolett barabas , hendrick haese , désirée nosbusch , arthur brauss , christopher cazenove , the rest of the cast in the film , actio , thrillers , dramas , and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today !
ok , so , this is coming a few weeks late , but it is here . mostly , this is because of statements of various negative natures . starting with the technology . when star trek : tos ran , special effect technology was extreamely low tec , and more than that , the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups . in the 35 years seince tos premiered , the crew of star trek have become experts at economy . ultimately , they have decided , quite rightly in my mind , to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all . so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii ? as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire , it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon 's in 2200 . nothing was firmly established . enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we 've seen in a while . this is what voyager could have been . no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies , but be thankful that star trek has so few . so , quit gripping and enjoy .
only seen season 1 so far but this is just great ! ! a wide variety of people stuck on a island . nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great ? it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files , a dose of `` what '' ? ? and a big `` hey '' and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmares and you 'll be lost to . the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable . great set up , solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human ( well almost everybody ... i think ... ) with good and bad sides . but weird oh so weird ...
the good earth is a great movie ! ! ! everybody must see ... it is tear-jerking and very heart warming . it caters to the enhancement of values-formation on perseverance , humility and the love of family ... the story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold . the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such , he may be left defenseless and useless . i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young actors ... their emotions has captivated the audience . the movie may have been done in black and white , but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end . that makes it really great ! there should be a re-make for this very nice movie .
i first saw `` breaking glass '' when it was released in england in 1980 .. i loved it then and having just caught it in august 2005 on a canadian station it still is great . the only thing i regret is i ca n't find the sound track or the dvd in the stores ? ? ... anyone care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company . but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time , hazel/kate had something to say about 80 's britain .. actually it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being `` thatcher '' and what she was doing to the country at the time . please if you get the chance watch this movie you wo n't be sorry !
while i do n't agree with bob 's and tammy 's decision to give up baby jesse , and it 's something i 'd never do , they were trying to do what was best for the baby . the way this movie is written , you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe , from all different aspects . patty duke ? antagonist ? almost unheard of , as far as i 'm concerned . but during the movie , she really convinces you that she 's psychotic , or at least , that there 's something seriously wrong with her . her character is the meaning of `` emotionally disturbed . '' the movie seems to end quickly , leaving things somewhat unresolved . but other than that , this movie is really great . it really makes you think . it 's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that 'll make you laugh . but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs , see things from others ' perspectives , and discover a little something about yourself . caution : you may even grow while watching this movie ! and it 's all worth it , in the end .
this movie is fun to watch , doesnt have much of a plot ( well , there is n't a plot ) , but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at . the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date , while chong is partying with cheech 's cousin ( they smoke dope , go in a music store , a massage parlor , a comedy club , and even go into someones house they do n't even know ! rated r
when originally screened in america in 1972 , 'the night stalker ' became the highest rated made-for-t.v . movie in history . based on jeff rice 's unpublished novel , it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak ( the late darren mcgavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day las vegas . when it arrived on british television four years later , it did not quite have the same impact , but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning , as indeed was i . we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen . i did not know of the existence of 'the night strangler ' until it turned up nearly a decade later . i.t.v. , who screened the 'kolchak ' movies , had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series ; they felt 'barnaby jones ' starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw , and anyway , viewers might confuse 'kolchak ' with 'kojak ' ! for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine . i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels . then something wonderful happened . in 1990 , b.b.c.-2 put out the show as part of a late-night friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'mystery train ' , hosted by richard o'brian . 'kolchak ' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'the brain eaters ' and 'earth vs.the spider ' . the opening titles were trimmed , removing kolchak 's whistling , and the closing credits ... well , there were none . the first episode screened was 'werewolf ' . i can not say i was overly impressed , but stuck with it , and am i glad that i did ! i really wish i 'd seen it in 1974 . my twelve year old self would have adored it . creepy , humorous , exciting , no wonder it fired chris carter 's imagination . the show 's biggest asset was , of course , mcgavin . unlike the recent kolchak , the original was an everyman figure , eccentrically dressed , rather conservative . he was to the supernatural what 'columbo ' was to crime . the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak 's bad-tempered boss tony vincenzo . the scripts overflowed with wonderful , dry wit . i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror . when the twenty episodes ended , i felt bereft . 'the x-files ' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent . i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back . i am glad that the show was never revived though . without oakland it would not have been the same . i have the rice books now and have read them several times . i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first ( in his book 'danse macabre ' ) as it is as good as anything he has written . alright , so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art , but so what ? the new 'kolchak ' totally missed the point of the original . what you do n't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... best episode - 'horror in the heights ' worst episode - 'the sentry '
this is best showing of what i think jesus really was like . most movies show jesus as being effeminate , lobotomized , or tortured . this jesus laughed , played , and was serious when it was necessary . this is the kind of jesus people could be attracted to , not the usually hollywood version . the movie took some liberties , attempting to `` fill in the blanks . '' but the fillers did n't seem impossible , or even improbable . one thing i might argue , was that it never really explained what the romans had against jesus ( movie portrayed that the romans were the main driver of jesus ' death , not that the jewish authorities were against the idea ) . it seemed that the movie was researched well . one example was the offhand comment to a teenage boy who was called `` mark . '' it is believed that mark ( or john mark ) was the boy referred to at the garden of gethsemane whose cloak was pulled off and ran away naked ( mark 14:51 ) . i get the feeling that they tried to make the movie as accurate ( even in spirit ) was much as possible .
based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time - the great 19th century american poet and humanist walt whitman - made a significant contribution to how western medicine treats people with psychological problems . interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems , he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients . after seeing the psychological methods of the time ( inhumane and ignorantly cruel methods ) , walt rejected those methods , and treated patients with compassion and dignity , encouraging other people to do the same > the story of walt 's interactions with psychiatric workers , patients and townsfolk is full of drama , good humor and wisdom . : )
enjoyable movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it . it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse . then , when we are finally given an explanation going back to her childhood there still is n't much detail . perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something . anyway , it is still a good movie that i 'd watch again . 7/10
after having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of imdb for `` pushing daisies '' , and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode , i thought it was about time i said what i thought of pd . first off , to address what some of the issues that i have seen other people having with this show : something along the lines of `` i expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction '' . realistic , on this show ? pushing daisies is , truly , pure and utter escapism . it 's colour palette , the dialogue used , the scenarios , situations , music : all of it , to me , is just an escape from everyday life . an escape from the mundane and boring . it is here where pushing daisies exceeds exceptionally well pushing daisies is n't for everyone : a large majority of the television audience do n't `` get '' it , for some people it 's just too out there and silly . but for people like me , even from the first episode i watched of it ( season 2 's `` frescorts '' ) and i was just blown away by the show . from then on , i bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my dvd player . other people i know ca n't stand it , it really seems to be like marmite . the show follows the adventures of ned , the piemaker , with a magic finger , who brings back childhood sweetheart charlotte charles , works in association with private investigator emerson cod , owns the pie-hole and employs waitress olive snook . completing the main cast members are aunts lily and vivian , whom charlotte ( chuck ) is never allowed to see . they live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life , everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour , and narrated by jim dale . other than outlining the basics of the show , i really ca n't praise it much more without saying : just watch it . despite being screwed over by the writer 's guild of america strike , with only 22 episodes ever to be made , it provides wonderful plot twists , story lines , characters and situations while providing ( for me ) a satisfying ending ( yes , i could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed , but i was still happy with the way it went out ) . whether it is creative or just pretentious , for a lot of people ( me included ) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing , and i hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so i 'm not left with just 22 , 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be .
this obscure de sica delivers the goods . and it is said `` the meek shall inherit the earth . '' this tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated europe after the great war . they are homeless but cheerful , in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them , footmats for the italian carpetbaggers . de sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale , a cinderella story . i have not read the book it is based on so i can not foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or vittorio . it begins with the words , `` once upon a time ... '' to exemplify the timelessness of its tale , for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere . caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone , whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all . de sica 's most accessible picture is also one of his best . abandoning neo-realism , he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making , he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world . gracias vittorio ! gracias ! gracias ! ! ! gracias ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i rated this film 7/10 which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay , direction and 1944 production values and 6/10 for acting.my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine ella raines as carol richman who was excellent at 8/10.also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on scott henderson ( alan curtis ) was just in view of his naive alibi.these two then form an alliance to prove scott 's alibi . i have this film on a `` suevia film noir cine negro '' dvd in spanish as `` la dama desconocida '' with the original soundtrack `` ingles '' as an alternative language , since despite searching i could not find a wholly english version.i was however anxious to see another performance by ella raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in `` impact '' playing a sole female garage proprietor.here ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in kansas ( her boss 's pet name for her ) before solving the missing alibi.the fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her.he had however designed children 's homes and playgrounds so i suppose `` family man '' had lit up in carol 's brain . in the 1940s with `` the film code '' in operation , producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by elisha cooke jnr.carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about `` the phantom lady '' alibi.the other main character , jack marlow ( an associate of scott henderson ) is played by franchot tone whose performance i found too theatrical and wondered why carol , for instance , did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands.here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience .
jane porter 's former love interest harry holt ( neil hamilton ) and his friend martin ( paul cavanagh ) come to tarzan 's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the `` elephant 's graveyard '' first seen in tarzan , the ape man ... only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions ... namely jane . will tarzan stand for that ? not likely ( in fact tarzan wo n't even stand for any disturbance done to the `` elephant 's graveyard '' ) and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party ( including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead ) is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions .. will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time ? this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer 's interest and does n't let up . the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and should n't be taken so seriously .
i found this a bit hard to follow to the extent that it seemed to dip in the middle while i tried to make head or tail of who was fighting who and why . one of the problems is the cultural/language one . here we have a chinese/taiwanese/japanese problem of which we know little and because we are simply reading english subtitles inevitably loose some of the subtleties . another problem is that there seem to be just too many only half explained twists and coincidences . nevertheless , it seems unlikely that there is a wholly bad miiki film and this certainly is not that . plenty of stylish and bone crunching violence , a window upon some less than orthodox sexual goings on plus the family aspect . all in all a decent ride but maybe checking out the storyline might actually be helpful before watching this one .
until today i had never seen this film . its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers . frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that wo n't quit , lionel atwill , dwight frye , faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother 's maiden name . this is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time , only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up . from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it . leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints . the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong , and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes ( the overlook film encyclopedia ) quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long . personally i think it wo n't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film . what ever the running time , if you like creaky old films , do , by all means do , watch this movie , its a great dark and stormy night film .
when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle , the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord . should the ring end up back in his hands , he will regain his power and destroy middle earth . frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors . this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story . regardless , this is an epic and wonderfully animated film . the animation is superbly done with rotoscope , which is tracing over live action footage . ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given . the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene . there are a few plot holes with the script , but that has to be excused , considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films , much had to crammed in the first one . my biggest gripe is some of the character design , samwise was a bit too goofy , while the other hobbits act completely normal . the other characters are actually well written for the screen , and the voice actors do a great job , i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot . the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening , while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish . another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman , thanks to the writers . overall , i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice , but there is something charming about it . ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories . the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films , but it 's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages .
this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle . stallone is gabe walker . cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists . renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie . stallone needed this role to get back on track . snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow , ice , cold and bad weather than finnish man . action is good ! music in the film is spectacular . the bad guy is john litghow , other stars micheal rooker ( the portrait of serialkiller ) , janine turner ( strong medicine ) . the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie . overall good movie * * * * / * * * * * remember extreme ääliöt : special collectors edition , with good extras . comig soon in finland straight to video .
my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 ( i 've always love scary movies ) and even then i enjoyed it . the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining . i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert . the rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick . the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie . this is definitely an uder-rated gem . i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies , early eighties such as `` alice , sweet alice '' , `` poor pretty eddie '' , `` nightmare '' , `` hospital massacre '' , and `` return of the aliens , the deadly spawn '' . definitely a classic ! !
if you are a fan , then you will probably enjoy this . if you do n't know who misty mundae , darian caine , ruby larocca , or seduction cinema are , this is not the movie to start out with . it 's very cute , silly , the girls are hot , and it 's fun to watch . there 's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film , but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot 's not a total bore . misty mundae 's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids , so she 's not as hot in this as she has been in others . but her panties in this are quite cute ( you 'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird ) . if you do like this one , you will probably enjoy `` that 70 's girl '' , `` vampire vixens '' , or `` erotic survivor '' ( which is a bit more sexually graphic ) . if you prefer watching misty or esmerelda in less sexual , more horror/exploitation-based ( but lower budget ) movies , check out the factory 2000 website .
i was n't a fan of seeing this movie at all , but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics . overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much . this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven . a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess . the movie was quite short though ( around 85 min . ) but it was enough to tell the whole story , build some character development and have a decent happy ending . the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow . eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast ( especially jason biggs ) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace . overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating . hey its a chick flick and i 'm reviewing this movie from a guy 's persepctive alright , it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it .
i had no idea that mr. izzard was so damn funny , it really boggles the mind that he is not more well known ! his command over the crowd and his timing is perfect.the monologue about star wars will kill ya too ! if only all the stand up performers had his wit ...
my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east ( mainly massachusetts ) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston . now , i do n't know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational . the first movie we saw was this one , the romeo division . now , i do n't know about you but i thought this was great ! i 'm from texas and where i come from we do n't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise . my mother insisted that it was too violent , but said that i did n't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture . i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great . also , i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys . this was true brilliance . i 'm not sure when it 's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out . i think you 'll be pleasantly surprised . a word to the wise though , it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch . it 's more for adults .
i really enjoyed watching this movie about the delany sisters . i knew of them , but that was all . this movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage . what a pair . what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms . this is not only a movie for african americans , but for all americans . it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography . the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years . both sisters are quite different from each other . they came from a very loving and very strict family with high , maybe even impossible standards of perfection . it is sad to see how sadie 's father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible misunderstanding . i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day .
it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as `` dukes of hazzard '' and `` the hills have eyes '' ( the new version ) can find dvd distributors while older - and far superior works such as this film - are nowhere to be found . with all the on-going debate about the morality ( or lack thereof ) of warfare , and interest in espionage ( consider the multiple jack ryan , bourne , xxx , and `` mission : impossible '' productions , this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd . true , it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture . but style consideration aside , this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say , and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained . if nothing else , will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd , whether it be a compilation with other morricone music or as a stand-alone . i do n't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products , but if you are reading this and other comments , please take us seriously . we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets , dvds and cds - give us what we want ! all that said , if you are reading this and have not seen this film , lobby for it 's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about . you will not be disappointed .
what a fun movie experience ! i was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that i enjoyed it more than my teens . take a tissue , it 's not sad , just 'moving ' in parts . finally , its a 'feel good ' flick for the whole family . note : it 's 2+ hours , so consider leaving the littlest 'squirmers ' home for this one . ap
the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters , as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.the horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors , playing parts.i have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this one.burt reynolds and jon voight were never better on screen , as well as fine performances by ned beatty , ronny cox , bill mckinney , and though he appeared only briefly , james dickey , the man who authored the book upon which the film is based , as the sheriff of aintry.it is somewhat disturbing , and kids , of course , should be shielded from it , but this is great , dramatic cinema .
i voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time . the animation is stunning . the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful . from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry . i was amazed . moving beyond the beauty on the screen , you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh . character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand . i 'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family .
`` hollywood hotel '' is a fast-moving , exuberant , wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from warners which is sadly overlooked . it should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of tinseltown -- `` hooray for hollywood . '' the score by richard whiting and johnny mercer has a number of other gems , however , including the charming `` i 'm like a fish out of water , '' and `` silhouetted in the moonlight . '' the best musical number is `` let that be a lesson to you , '' in which dick powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves `` behind the eight-ball , '' a fate which literally befalls slow-burning edgar kennedy at the number 's end . the picture celebrates hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once , as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego-maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives . the cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians -- allyn joslyn as a crafty press agent , ted healy as dick powell 's would-be manager , fritz feld as an excitable restaurant patron , glenda farrell as mona marshall 's sarcastic gal friday , edgar kennedy as a put-upon drive-in manager , mabel todd as mona 's goofy sister , and hugh herbert as her even goofier dad . the `` racist '' element mentioned in another review here is a ten-second bit where herbert appears in black-face during a pseudo- '' gone with the wind '' sequence . it 's in questionable taste , but it should n't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film , notably the benny goodman quartet ( including teddy wilson and lionel hampton ! ) in what i believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo . the `` dark eyes '' sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late , but otherwise `` hollywood hotel '' is a gem , well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for dvd release .
this movie really kicked some ass . i watched it over and over and it never got boring . angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie , you should see the movie , you wo n't be disappointed . and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x-files is in it , david duchovny .
this 1986 italian-french remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early , and does n't let us come up for air . the story is about a high-school student ( federico pitzalis ) who ca n't keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman ( played by dutch phenom maruschka detmers ) who lives next door to the school . one day , he follows her , and his persistence pays off . there 's only one problem : she 's engaged to a sketchy character ( riccardo de torrebruna ) who may or may not have committed a heinous crime , and if he repents , will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist . also , the young woman is a little `` funny in the head '' , and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boy 's father , who is a psychiatrist . giulia 's emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires . hot , hot , hot , from the word go , with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from detmers , who plays us like a yo-yo ( as she does the boy ) from scene to scene , with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until -- and even after -- the end . available in r and x ( ! ) rated versions .
i watched this over the christmas period , i do n't know why but it reminds me of christmas so i watched it , so there we are . arthur is a film i watch all the way through with a big dumb smile on my face and its a mixture of special performances , great jolly music and a script crackling with wit and charm that causes it . dudley moore makes a character that could well be hated very easily ( spoiled , rich , lazy drunk who feels sorry for himself ) but turns him into someone you love . liza minelli is great as linda morolla a queens waitress who manages to pull off the tough/soft on the inside lady arthur nearly gives up his world for . john gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish . i can watch arthur again and again and it always makes me feel good , check it out if you need a lift its a lovely film .
for a low budget movie this was really good . i put this well above your average action b-movie . sean and corinne delivered in this movie , and they did n't seem camera shy . watch out for the cameos of jeanne and jared . i did n't think that the producers would even consider that , but the runner-ups deserve that much . i 'll be looking forward to more of sean and corinne 's involvement in the movie entertainment industry . sean 's character seemed very genuine , and sexy corinne 's character was pretty hard-nosed and on point . she connected well with the action sequences and executed with confidence . it was a great idea to cast billy zane as the smart and witty villain . his charisma on screen is always a pleasure to watch . the chemistry between zane and sean 's character was pretty good . the action sequences were n't cheesy and seemed to connect throughout the movie . of course there were flaws , but that comes with the territory . overall , this was a good movie considering the budget and the fact that it was made for tv . sean and corinne did a good job considering that they are newcomers to the game . i hope that jeanne , jared , and the rest of the next action star cast get their chance to also join their co-stars in entertainment success . final judgment : * * * / * * * *
spoilers 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attacks on the wtc.2 french film makers who are in new york to film the actions of a nyfd are being confronted with this event and make the most of it.before 9/11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario . on the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change.as one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane , this is the only footage of the first impact.he rides with the firemen to the wtc and goes inside the building.as the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.in the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible , in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds , these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground , this is the most grueling moment in the documentary.then the tower collapses and our french friend has to run for his life , you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building.then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black , he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of downtown new york . because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody 's memory.i saw the attacks live at home because i had the afternoon of , so this makes it even more realistic to watch . 10/10
this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it . as the credits rolled , the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go . after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful film . yes it was formulaic and predictable , but that somehow added to it 's charm . the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions . a real feel-good film , punctuated throughout with outstanding music . when it 's released , i 'll buy it !
my abiding love of italian actress lucianna paluzzi , who helped jump-start my puberty with her performance in 1965 's `` thunderball , '' has led me to some fairly unusual places . case in point , this british curiosity from 1959 , `` carlton-browne of the f.o. , '' which features lucianna in one of her earlier roles . she plays a princess in this one , although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of terry-thomas and peter sellers , both of whose stars were certainly on the rise at this point . in this cute , often very funny film , we learn of the madeira-like island nation of gaillardia , which had been a british colony until 1916 and then universally forgotten . forty-three years later , however , it becomes the center of worldwide attention and international espionage when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there , and her majesty sends the bumbling carlton-browne of the foreign office to take charge . terry-thomas underplays this part nicely , as does sellers in his role as prime minister amphibulos of the tiny country . ( this was sellers ' second film of 1959 concerning a tiny country matching wits with the world , the other being `` the mouse that roared , '' of course . ) ian bannen almost steals the show here as gaillardia 's suave king , and my girl lucianna is as appealing as can be in her minor role . the film exhibits much in the way of very dry humor , although there are some belly laughs to be had ( the reception at the gaillardian airport , for example , and especially that may day-style parade of gaillardian strength ) . and sellers ' seedy prime minister , with his cracked english and seemingly perpetual sweat stains , is yet another memorable character in this great actor 's pantheon . despite the occasional instance or two of indecipherable , stiff-upper-lip british gibberish , i found this picture to be a winningly modest entertainment , and well presented on this crisp-looking anchor bay dvd .
like many people on this site , i saw this movie only once , when it was first televised in 1971 . certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how i remember being affected by it . i would be fascinated to see it again , if it was ever made available for home video . possible spoiler : i wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 british movie , originally titled city of the dead , retitled horror hotel for the american release ? there are some similarities also to a later british film the wicker man . one detail remains with me years after seeing the film . it 's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film . as i recall , a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road , circa 1870 , somewhere out west . the friendly seeming ray milland introduces himself and his ( daughter ? ) , yvette mimieux , a beautiful young mute woman . while the preacher is helping ray milland with the wagon , a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly , unobserved by any of the characters except yvette mimieux . she does n't look scared at all , but stares at the snake with silent concentration , until it goes away . with this strange little moment , we already realize there 's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks , though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time . that one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years , along with many others . the film has a haunting quality about it that wo n't let go , and it 's not surprising that people remember it so vividly . someone ought to make this available for home video !
i could not agree more with the quote `` this is one of the best films ever made . '' if you think vanilla sky is simply a `` re-make , '' you could not be more wrong . there is tremendous depth in this film : visually , musically , and emotionally . visually , because the film is soft and delicate at times ( early scenes with sofia ) and at other times powerful and intense ( times square , post-climactic scenes ) . the music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly . without the music , the story is only half told . nancy wilson created an emotional , yet eclectic , score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme ( although never released , i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $ 60 . if you look hard , you may be able to find a copy yourself ) . crowe 's other musical selections , such as the beach boys , josh rouse , spiritualized , sigur ros , the monkees , etcetera etcetera , are also perfect fits for the film ( crowe has an ear for great music ) . more importantly , the emotional themes in this film ( i.e . love , sadness , regret ) are very powerful , and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience , as well as the ingenious dialogue ; i admit , the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again . the best part of this film however ( as if it could get any better ) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film , you will catch something new -- so watch closely , and be prepared to think ! sure , a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch , but there is always more to the story than you think . this is easily cameron crowe 's best work , and altogether a work of brilliance . much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone . it has honestly touched my life , as true art has a tendency of doing . it continually surprises me that there are many people that can not appreciate this film for what it is ( i guess to understand true art is an art itself ) . bottom line : vanilla sky is in a league of its own .

this movie was amazing , it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director/ writer . sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too . this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience . the acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film . this film focuses on the real americans , the past generation , no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life . this film is about loss and coping . instead of picking on psychiatry , it defines it , not as someone who heals you magically , but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you , but rather will guide you though your thoughts . this movie is all round amazing !
i 've seen hundreds of silent movies . some will always be classics ( such as nosferatu , metropolis , the general and wings ) but among them , my favorite is this film ( it may not be the best -- but a favorite , yes ) . in fact , when i looked it up on imdb , i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made . marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst 's mistress . the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star ! her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see !
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched . as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed , i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed . except asia carrera 's sexual scene , any sexual scene in this movie does n't make me feel great ( you know what i mean ) . the great jenna jameson does n't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of . felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned . although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor , this movie is very good . if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies . story , acting , direction , sets , makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great . the actors of this movie done really good acting , they all done a great job . dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies .
series 2 has got off to a great start ! i do n't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them . and this show makes you think like that ! these 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic . so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too . its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices !
this is absolutely one of the best movies i 've ever seen . it takes me on a a roller-coaster of emotions . i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love ! all this in a little over two hours of time ! the actors are all brilliant ! i have to mention the leading actor of course , michael nyquist . he does a remarkable job ! ! i also admire the actor who plays tore , who plays this mentally-challenged young man in such a convincing way ! he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape ! and then there is the most beautiful song in the world : gabriella 's sång . i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy !
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary . what i love most about it is that it is understated and low-key , but deeply heartfelt . henry thomas ' ( he played the child in e.t . ) performance is masterfully inarticulate ( he is supposed to be a man of few words ) . david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain . and miraculously ( given that we 're talking about a hollywood product here ) a baby serves as a main character , but one who does n't act or have lines , but rather just is ( & is luminous at that ) . interesting to note that thomas ' mysterious relationship w. e.t . was the core of that film ; while his bond w. the baby serves as the core of `` a good baby . '' then there is the music -- ah , what music ! ! gillian welch 's tunes are wonderful & the entire score is gorgeous hill country music . this film is wonderfully atmospheric . i recommend it highly .
i think the movie was pretty good , will add it to my `` clasic collection '' after all this time . i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie . maybe some of the more esoteric points defy `` logic '' , but a great many religious matters accepted `` on faith '' fail to pass the smell test . if you 're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie . is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja-yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in `` the shadow '' . no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here ( imdb ) , but i would bet a dollar to a donut it 's the same prop .
a very refreshing story , the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human 's . shows humans from a bird 's point of view . especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with . not all birds are bird-brained ...
i participate in a filmmaker 's symposium , and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a 40 minute discussion . even though it was incredibly late and we were weary , the entire audience really enjoyed it . personally i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots , and i loved the quirky cast of characters . they really grow on you in the film .
this film made john glover a star . alan raimy is one of the most compelling character that i have ever seen on film . and i mean that sport .
it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip `` basic instinct 2 , '' to the point that a significant part of the audience ( including critics ) found it terrible even before it was released . it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older , andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful . first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself . in my opinion , this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film , but is not as bad as most comments pretend . michael caton-jones is not paul verhoeven , neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas . `` basic instinct 2 '' is just an entertaining , average thriller , and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score , keeps little resemblance to its predecessor . even stone gives her character a different dimension , creating a lustful , devilish catherine trimell , who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter . she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure . unfortunately , she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick . she became too successful , too much of a main icon , and like all those actors who have reached that level , her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences . the rest of the cast is outstanding , giving performances that are far better than the material deserves . david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas : his acting is flawless , giving a dense , complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character . since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie , he can keep your attention from beginning to end . i am not recommending `` basic instinct 2 '' as a great movie ; i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators .
engaging , riveting tale of captured us army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman . paul ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a us spy on a secret mission in korea . in the vein of classic courtroom dramas , `` sergeant ryker '' is an extremely well crafted mystery , ably guided by an outstanding cast , director kulik 's constant momentum , and effective plot twists and turns . this film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 , and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many `` name '' actors , and some action sequences . dillman , reprising his role , is spot-on as the doubting defence attorney , whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of ryker 's supportive , yet somewhat distant wife , played with aplomb by vera miles . rounding out the frontline is peter graves for the prosecution , and norman fell and murray hamilton in key supporting roles . marvin 's interpretation of the paul ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he 's placed . marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference , to passionate determination , giving a convincing , often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama . it 's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever lists of courtroom dramas . however , despite its apparent obscurity , `` sergeant ryker '' still remains a taut and compelling examination , like a book that you just ca n't put down . highly recommended .
i loved so much about this movie ... the time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack ... it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that wo n't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick . if we lived in elizabethan days , i 'd say this movie 's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy . but since we do n't , let 's say it 's more like a drama-suspense movie . the plot is simple , but the story is complex . the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . much of the story is shown rather than told , which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book ( or graphic novel ) . at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s , part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling . i do n't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case i do . ( though i did enjoy the book too . ) i 've bought the dvd , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary . ( i also took my little cousin , who 's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after i saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him . he loved it - and the discussion . )
in stand by me , vern and teddy discuss who was tougher , superman or mighty mouse . my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too . sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix . but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan , bruce lee and jet li . it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead , but it is a fun one . and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask , you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan . in this film he comes across as a martial arts god . black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men , to be supreme fighting machines . their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose . they are invincible in some ways . now that is the premise for the film , but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes . jet li is a marvel . he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do . and that is what makes watching him so fun . besides the martial arts in the film , black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star , the police officer . they are great together . but to be honest . if anyone is reading this review , they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department . and the answer to that is a resounding yes ! ! ! lots and lots of gory mindless action . you will love this film .
elvira , mistress of the dark ( 1988 ) directed by : james signorelli starring : cassandra peterson , w. morgan sheppard , daniel greene , and edie mcclurg plot : elvira ( cassandra peterson ) quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell , massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt 's inheritance , hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas . unfortunately for her , all she gets is a creepy old house , a poodle , and a magic cookbook . while in fallwell , elvira tries to make money , breathe some life into the teenagers , win the heart of a stud ( daniel greene ) , avoid being burned at the stake , and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle ( w. morgan sheppard ) , who is planning to use the book to end the world . my thoughts : i love both cassandra peterson and her alter-ego elvira . she is a very successful , beautiful , and funny woman and as elvira she 's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive , not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers . in this movie , her charms are put to good use . i loved the whole 'fish out of water ' feel to the film . you got elvira , with her low-cut black dress , her big black hair , and her enormous 'twins ' , and she 's in a christian town where most of the girls are n't even allowed to wear makeup . this also makes her love story with bob ( daniel greene ) a lot more entertaining . w. morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira 's uncle/nemesis vincent , out to steal the book to use it for evil . he has a lot of presence but still does n't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira . what really makes the film is not the plot , but the many jokes . everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel . i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film , and any fan of roger corman b-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film . if you love elvira , you will love this flick . also check out elvira 's haunted hills .
i settled back to watch `` read my lips , '' a plate of freedom fries before me . the food was quickly forgotten as i became engrossed by director and co-writer jacques audiard 's original and superb thriller . carla ( emmanuelle devos ) is a secretary at a firm that develops major building projects . she actually has some significant responsibilities that do n't often fall to secretaries and she 's capable and ambitious . and thwarted by a male hierarchy that will exploit but not reward her . work piling up faster than she can handle it , carla is told to hire a secretary . enter ex-con and general layabout paul ( vincent cassel ) . he lies about his skills and in fact has none that any legitimate enterprise might require . after an initial serious misunderstanding by paul as to carla 's interest in him , the two become allies . a quirky friendship starts . in a stunt that would have made a real carla a major contender on `` the apprentice , '' she trumps her egotistic male adversary at work with paul 's connivance . exit the rival . carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid . with it she hears almost normally . she turns the hearing aid off to isolate herself from unpleasant sounds and annoying people . she 's also very lonely . a heroic makeup effort was made to have her appear plain but she 's truly beautiful . she has n't a boyfriend . she babysits so a friend can have a liaison ( it is a french movie ) worse and humiliatingly , she accedes to a girlfriend 's plea that she hang out somewhere while that married friend has it off with her paramour in carla 's bed . not nice . as carla and paul get to know each other better , the barely repressed larcenous side of the not so former felon emerges . there 's a side story , by the way , of paul 's relationship with his parole officer which neatly complements the main plot and has its own big surprise ending . `` read my lips ? '' ingenious paul recognizes that carla 's ability to read lips , even from a considerable distance , is more than the amusing parlor trick it first seems to be . from there a caper develops . enough said . paul and carla are a true criminal oddball couple . she wants love but will also accept money . he wants her , sort of , but business must come before possible erotic satiation . together cassel and devos are strong actors carrying an unusual crime tale to its end very convincingly . rent it or buy it but if you enjoy a good crime story you 'll go for `` read my lips . '' and you may well want to watch it several times : i do . 9/10
this movie really woke me up , like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber . this guy john ( ben chaplin ) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town , until the stunningly gorgeous , wild , girl-to-die-for nadia ( nicole kidman ) , ordered by email from russia , enters his life to become his beloved wife , by johns plan . however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language . although calm and emotionless on the outside , john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service , he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process . what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure , giving the viewer a subliminal message `` you would have probably acted likewise '' . kidman , cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing , `` almost '' only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues , however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right . nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles , at least from the cultural background . the pace of the film is fast and captivating , and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear , you rather feel that you 're in the middle of the plot , and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out . my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy . to sum it up , it has an unusual plot , great acting , and ideas below the surface . like the idea of the `` rude awakening '' from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society 's machine , the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings ( `` welcome to the machine ! '' ) . i bet that in the end , john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all . thank you , writers , for the great story , and everyone else for this great movie ! please make a sequel ! and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever , because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers , i am sure of it .
look , if i were interested in a nancy drew book , what i would do is pick up a book and read it . i 'm not . ever since i can remember i read people trashing movies because it was n't like the book . i 'm sorry - in the digital age we can no longer watch movies on flip books , however i 'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in book form . when lord of the rings came out , people complained . when the third one won an oscar - `` the book was better . '' when i watched to kill a mockingbird , `` the book was better . '' now a bunch of people are upset , yet again , because nancy drew was n't like the book . i 'm not saying nancy drew is going to win any oscars - if anything it 'll be one of those nickelodeon blimps or kids choice awards . i 'm saying give film a break . it 's film , not paper . as a movie , i found nancy drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg ( the hebrew hammer ) and supporting roles featuring tate donovan ( jimmy cooper on the o.c . ) and rachel leigh cook ( she 's all that ) . this is the first time i 've seen emma roberts in a movie and , frankly , i enjoy her work more than most of julia and of eric 's ; her character stays consistent throughout the film and reacts well with conflict . a lighthearted movie in the spirit of harriet the spy is nice now and again . i give it ten stars because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie , would love to see it again , and will probably buy it upon dvd release .
the original movie , the odd couple , has some wonderful comic one-liners . the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak felix ungar and funny , obnoxious , slob oscar madison . this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless , not anywhere near as good , imitations . the odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscar 's apartment and his sloppy habits . he says , `` who wants food ? '' one of his poker player buddies asks , `` what do ya got ? '' oscar says , `` i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches . '' `` what 's the brown ? '' it 's either very new cheese or very old meat ! '' i also love the line about oscar 's refrigerator , `` it 's been out of order for two weeks , i saw milk standing in there that was n't even in a bottle ! '' there is no question that walter matthau 's oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen . he 's almost as good as jack klugman 's version in the tv series . the problem with the movie is jack lemmon 's felix ungar . jack makes a very , very , honest effort at the role . the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical . tony randall 's performance in the series , brought the kind of humor , warmth , and sensitivity , to felix 's character , which lemmon 's portrayal lacks . tony 's felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time . however , in the tv series , it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline . jack 's felix ungar , ( note the different spelling ) in the movie , seems to never be happy , fun , or interesting . the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall , all the time . the movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time , the `` famous '' meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever ! one of the other great examples of felix 's `` little notes '' on oscar 's pillow will be remembered forever . however , there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top , his `` crying '' near the end after bawling out felix , and a scene involving felix 's linguine dinner , ( although lightened by a funny line . ) seem more depressing than comical . perhaps there was n't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie . the beginning 20 minutes are very boring . the same issue occurs with felix 's conversation with the pidgeon sisters . the movie 's ending is predictable and too pat . there 's very little care or compassion for each of them by the other . the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger , rather than comedy , unless you are watching the great scenes described above . it appears that jack lemmon 's monotone persona of felix brings the film down , rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters . it really took the 1970 's tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be . the original film is still very good . however , the tv series is much better .
i did n't expect much when i rented this movie and it blew me away . if you like good drama , good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them , you 'll love this movie . engrossing !
it 's hard to top this movie in several ways . everything works really well here ; the casting , acting , script , and cinematography are all first-rate . for the moviegoer , it 's a moving , violent story of love and human redemption . for the film critic , there 's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit . there are some tactical blunders , and as has been discussed on the boards , the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle . however , i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent 's pragmatic approach , creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences . like jesus himself , creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice , whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not . in any case , i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice , which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent . in any case , this film is very much worth watching if you 're at all attracted to the genre . an excellent soundtrack , great writing , flawless casting , and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 ( or better ) film .
film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light . good night and good luck , for instance , offered parallels to modern judgement-without-evidence and encroachments on freedom . it is easier to examine a moral problem when it is not too close to home : by putting it in a fictional or historic context removed from our immediate situation . with pornography , we consider ourselves 'enlightened ' and our forefathers to be hidebound by quaint ideas - usually involving fire and brimstone , but the definition of what is obscene can easily fall prey to ignorance and unscientific interpretation instead of evidence . bettie page was a cult icon of an era which included not just mccarthyism but the banning of comics ( such as tales from the crypt ) on the basis that they would turn youths into half-mad juvenile delinquents . this film , developed from key questions raised in her life , poses dilemmas that are as relevant today as back in 1950 . our film opens with two key scenes . in the first , we see well-dressed , respectable looking men in a seedy bookshop . one of them asks for pictures of women in kinky boots and being restrained - then turns out to be an undercover cop conducting a sting . the second scene shows bettie page , waiting to be called as a witness , looking quite demure , as if she had just come out of church . the first 50mins are in black & white . old fashioned film effects such as wipes and fades add to the sense that we are watching a film from bygone years , as do the mannerisms of the cast , skilfully recreated 1950s scenes , contemporaneous slang phrases and the terse dialogue associated with film-making of the period . archive footage is frequently intercut - which will delight many and irritate others . in keeping with its theme , the movie is almost a collection of different types of photography-in-motion , and the older clips of fabulous beaches and landmarks juxtapose well against bettie 's classic poses hearken back to an age of 'health & nature ' magazines . . . although i admit that if you are not captivated by the story you may find the effect a bit choppy . very soon , we go into flashback . bettie escapes a depression years downtrodden life in nashville , enlivened only with church singing and soul-saving , and goes alone to make her own way . after her initial success , her modelling work splits into two strands : the mainstream glamour work focussing on her over-the-rainbow smile , and the 'specialist interest ' photos involving dressing up in high-heeled boots and light bondage gear . in an earlier audition ( reminiscent of a scene with naomi watts ' character in mulholland drive - who was also called betty ) , she gives a performance that is full of emotion , contrasting with her normal animated , cheerful ( but ultimately bland ) day-to-day expression . is part of her still unfulfilled ? bettie is frequently rejected in auditions once they realise she is the well-known pin-up girl . but we have never been asked to feel sorry for bettie page : her abusive childhood is quickly referenced and skipped over ; when she is raped by four hometown lads , we see only the threat and then bettie recovering and surviving , picking herself up in deserted woodland , and putting on the brave face of someone who refuses to lie down and die . although no nudity is involved , it 's bettie 's special interest photos that eventually arouse trouble . when we go back to the court , the opinions of a clergyman on the corrupting influence of such photos are taken as evidence . a psychologist authoritatively says how the photos lead to 'suicide , murder and psychosis ' in youngsters who are exposed to them ( presumably not in that order ) . eventually a star witness explains how his son 's life came to an end as a result of such photos - 'being 'trussed up like that ' . it is not made clear how being 'trussed up ' causes death ) . the text accompanying a series of bettie 's photographs in a magazine tell how she was forced to endure 'terrible agonies ' with the fetish restraints ( the audience knows that she actually found them quite hilarious and that the wordings , like the photos themselves , were pure dramatisations ) . after a 12hr wait , bettie is told her evidence - she is the one person who could state definitively that she was not photographed in agony - will 'not be required ' . the 'horrors ' of the photos have been proved . if this all sounds like the dark ages which we have left , consider a recent ( 2003 ) incident in which an ann summers advert was banned . it said , `` for fashion and passion whip along to your local store , '' with a photograph of a woman 's back . she 's wearing a bra and thong and her hands are handcuffed behind her back . the lingerie and sex toys company , that targets female consumers ( and also supports charities fighting domestic violence ) said its adverts aimed , `` to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality . '' one might conclude that the prejudice and ignorance of the betty page investigations still holds currency . bettie 's religious views are integral to the story , just as the concept of sin is integral to christianity and contributes to the 'forbidden ' nature of sexual enjoyment frequently prevalent in the uk and us - as opposed to the more factual approach found in continental europe . it could be argued the formulae of sin and redemption , and `` being saved '' , are even reflected in mating patterns that perpetuate traditional male dominance . a policeman making a friendly ( but sexually motivated ) approach to bettie outside the courtroom offers to 'save ' her from loneliness . the knight-in-shining-armour might be chivalrous , but it also assumes a woman in need of rescue . love it or hate it , the notorious bettie page is an unusual and extraordinary film , and a moral wake-up call for those that heed it . there is excellent ensemble acting , and gretchen mol , as bettie , is remarkable as the whole film succeeds or falls on her powerful performance .
things to come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction ; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress . it makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later , but is woefully naive in it 's utopian ideals . raymond massey , cedric hardwicke , and ralph richardson make up a fine cast , although the drama is played more as a stage piece , than a work of cinema . there are grandiose , if somewhat stilted speeches , often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater . however , there are some profound words there . is technology the savior of mankind , or the instrument of its destruction ? the film is a visual feast , if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects . sure , hollywood is more sophisticated today , but rarely as inventive . for the imaginative , the third act is a treat : a world with underground cities , massive deco bombers , space cannons , gyro copters , and secret organizations of scientist saviors . it has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure , but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise . things to come and metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic hollywood science fiction cinema . they are operatic in scope , and visually inspiring . technology has long left them behind , but their ideas still burst forth . there is an artistry there , one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today . these films are the products of artisans , not industrialists .
i remember being terrified of movie blood when i was younger , and gradually getting less so , until getting jaded enough , as i 'm sure many other viewers have become , so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm . `` the dentist '' turned that around . the setup seems simple : a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths , and perhaps bodies as well . a clever twist , though , is that the dentist is the film 's protagonist , so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation , his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable . the viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims , and instead of hoping for justice to come to him , i found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal life . what really `` makes '' a horror movie is the violence . and `` the dentist '' does it better than any other film i can think of . first off , the film has tons of tension , which is something that modern gore films tend to lack . in one scene ( ) , the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time . as he reaches into the child 's mouth , you hope that , for the dentist 's and the child 's sake , the encounter ends without injury . i wo n't spoil what happens . second , when the gore does come , it hits all the worst , squirmy nerves . once again , i wo n't give anything away . of course , being a movie that you 've never heard of , it does have flaws . most importantly , it 's exclusively for horror fans . also , as another reviewer mentioned , by taking place over a span of just a few days , we do n't really get any background on the characters . and the tension drops a little bit during the very end . but really , the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is , and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgiven . it 's strange , after years of being accustomed to movie gore , to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood . `` the dentist '' made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable , and for this it earns my full approval .
if you liked roman polanski 's `` repulsion '' , you should probably check out `` the tenant '' since it 's a similar concept , just with polanski stepping in and playing the schizophrenic wacko . this is actually one of my favorites of his movies - second , after `` rosemary 's baby '' , of course - and is a straight forward journey into the mental collapse of a man who moves into the former apartment of a suicide victim . the other residents of the building are all flaky and sticklers on keeping the noise level down - even the slightest 'titter ' becomes a big deal and polanski , who stars , becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his loony hallucinations further and further as the film carries on . it gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the former tenant and you realize it 's only a matter of time before he decides tor re-enact her fatal leap out the window ... the film is a bit slow and dawdling for a while , but if you have ever seen a roman polanski movie , you should know it 's going to end with a bang and this flick does n't disappoint . it 's also best if you do n't question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness , because it 's pretty trippy surreal at times . polanski is very good as the timid , deranged resident who , somehow , attracts the ever illustrious isabelle adjani . we also get to see him running around in drag , which is disturbing and hilarious all at the same time ! damn , he makes for one ugly chick ! so , polanski fans - who can actually look past his thirty year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy `` the tenant '' as an entertaining psychological head-trip ...
the intruder ( l'intrus ) , a film directed by french director clair denis , is the liberation of film . it follows its own spirit across time , space , and character . there may be a plot , but what i understood of that i picked up from the description on the netflix dvd sleeve . honestly , it 's probably better to know nothing about the film before watching it , because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations . the film demands that the viewer think , but also taunts the fact that he or she will not gain full understanding . the human heart is the film 's enigma . every image questions its role , its nature , and its form . the heart is the intruder , that of the viewer and that of louis . louis ' character is played by michel subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character . honestly , anyone could 've played louis ' character , if he or she possessed a wandering , willing , and comfortable heart . yet subor is the one featured here ; he becomes the film , his identity is inseparable from it . many of the film 's images lingering in my mind revolve around his expressions , vocal but mainly physical . the intruder is poetic in its ability to capture the stillness and fullness of movement , but more fluid than any literature in the shape it refuses to take . `` surrealistic '' has been a term used in describing this film , but perhaps `` quasirealistic '' is a more adequate term . nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality ; the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light . watch the trailer a few times if you 're attracted to visual imagery ; see the film to see the consequences of the combination of verse and a grasping for freedom .
* may contain spoilers * * may contain spoilers * in the age of shrek ( the movie ) & pixar ( the studio ) , this is a much more traditional animation film . it put together some characters that normally would n't be seen together ( not to mentioned , try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father ) . they begin as enemies and end as best friend . if this sound like a disney film , it is ( only made through 20th century fox ) . the trailer to the movie was one of the best i 've seen in ages , but the movie does n't live to the expectation the trailer set . the problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film did n't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film . yes , there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children . the parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min . their children 's attention is focused on something else than them . the backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film . children will love this film , adults will only like it .
what a surprise ; two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film . this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic . this film certainly should be in oscar contention . see this movie !
i was absolutely blown away by john cassavetes 's opening night . it 's the first movie of his that i 've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale , thus it feels more mainstream , but it still does n't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films . that is perhaps what makes it so intense . there is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie . it 's about what in fact cassavetes has made a staple of his career , an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front . rowlands 's character , middle-aged stage actress myrtle gordon , can not bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse , resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage , until she finds the right one . it 's a daringly abstract premise . this is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing . no one understands why myrtle does many of the things she does , and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive , yet it just might be the best thing for her . it may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown . a withdrawal , a cocoon , a rebellion , it all culminates into a meltdown . cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch , which is that early on , she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character , yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true . the last scene , the climactic performance that myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her , is one of the most interesting , hilarious , hard-hitting , enlightening , and enjoyable moments i 've ever seen in a movie .
this is surprisingly above average slasher , that 's enjoyable and well made , with some decent gore ! . all the characters are decent , and the story is quite fun , plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well . i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1 $ , and it was surprisingly worth it , and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget , plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy . the finale was really cool , as i loved how they defeated the killer , and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well , plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable ! . it 's decently made and written , and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well , plus some of the death scenes were very impressive . this killer did n't mess around , and i loved it , and slasher fans ( like myself ) should really enjoy this film , plus the opening was really wicked too , with them filming the movie ! . this is a surprisingly above average slasher , that 's enjoyable , and well made , with some decent gore , and i say it 's well worth the watch ! . the direction is good . kimble rendall does a good ! job here with solid camera work , using a creepy setting , good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace . the acting is solid ! . molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well , and i had troubles feeling sorry for her , after all she was supposed to be the heroine , she turned out better towards the end , but not by much , i 'm surprised she decided to do this film , nonetheless she did an excellent job ! . frank roberts is fantastic as the killer , he is menacing , creepy and had one hell of a mask , and this guy did n't mess around , he was fantastic ! . kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role . jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine . rest of the cast are fine . overall well worth the watch ! . * * * out of 5
i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning . i 'm going to assume that one 's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one 's level of acceptance of joseph 's story . however , that aside it was very well made , well acted , and had a nice score . if you get to salt lake city , it is a must to see it in the legacy theater . i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality , sound quality and ambiance in my entire life ... i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there ! being that i 'm lds and regard joseph as a prophet , i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times ... which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started ! anyway , i 'm told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe , if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not , he tells a fascinating story .
can any one help find out the title and artist of the song , that was played at least halfway through the movie . i ca n't remember what scene was playing . the words in the song are of a ballad . some of the lyrics go like `` it 's natures way of telling you somethings wrong . '' it 's natures way of telling it in a song . '' `` it 's natures way of forgiving you . '' please help me with this question . thanks so much ! i have been searching the internet for days , i ca n't get this song out of my mind . so now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter . i wish i would of been paying attention to the scene , when it was playing .
dreamquest is by far , the best porn movie i 've ever viewed . this is a must see ! ! ! and if you 're skeptical about your little ones watching it , just skip over the naughty scenes . of course , this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes . but even then it 's enjoyable . this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie ... even shawshank redemption .
the humor implicit in the complete title proverb derives from the sunday school dictum that one would be better advised to prepare before you 're dead for the devil 's scrutiny , i.e . so the devil does n't care when you 're dead . there 's no percentage in trying to beat the devil . the characters apparently did n't pay attention at sunday school , and find themselves forced into crisis management , having eschewed crisis avoidance . but even a seasoned ceo would have difficulty managing these crises . throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin ; when people are involved , the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable sidney lumet films . until now , hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other lumet all stars like steiger and pacino .
romance is in the air and love is in bloom in victorian era england , in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue , the ladies were charming and elegant , and the gentlemen dashing . ` emma , ' based on the novel by jane austen and written for the screen and directed by douglas mcgrath , stars the lovely gwyneth paltrow in the title role . a self-appointed matchmaker , emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another . coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage , she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend , harriet ( toni collette ) , but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying . meanwhile , her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome mr. knightley ( jeremy northam ) , whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than emma 's , and lend some needed balance to the proceedings . and emma , so concerned with what is right for others , neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all : her own . the world goes round and love abounds , but emma is about to miss the boat . luckily for her , however , the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings . now , if she can but stop long enough to realize it . but as everyone who has known true love knows , matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant , depending upon the slightest thing ; and while romance is at hand for emma , she must first recognize it , and seize the moment . mcgrath has crafted and delivered a delightful , feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world . there may be an air of frivolity about it , but in retrospect , this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is -- in all honesty -- to just about anyone : love . and with mcgrath 's impeccable sense of pace and timing , it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable . it 's a pleasant , affecting film , with a wonderful cast , that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place . it 's light fare , but absorbing ; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow . the winsome paltrow , who won the oscar for best actress for ` shakespeare in love ' two years after making this one , seems comfortable and right at home in this genre . she personifies all things british , and does it with such naturalness and facility that it 's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether . she 's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy . she has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner , very reminiscent of audrey hepburn . yet paltrow is unique . as an actor , she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated -- with such films as ` hard eight , ' ` hush ' and ` a perfect murder ' -- that she can play just about any part effectively , and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own . but it 's with characters like emma that she really shines . she is so expressive and open , and her personality is so engaging , that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch , regardless of the part she is playing . and for emma , she is absolutely perfect . jeremy northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of knightley , and like paltrow , seems suited to the genre -- in the right role , that is ; his performance in the more recent ` the golden bowl , ' in which he played an italian prince , was less than satisfying . here , however , he is perfect ; he is handsome , and carries himself in such a way that makes knightley believable and very real . like colin firth 's mr. darcy in the miniseries ` pride and prejudice , ' northam has created a memorable character with his own mr. knightley . also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are toni collette , as emma 's friend harriet smith ; and alan cumming , as the reverend elton . respectively , collette and cumming create characters who are very real people , and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film . and it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema , and to films of any genre . the supporting cast includes greta scacchi ( mrs. weston ) , denys hawthorne ( mr. woodhouse ) , sophie thompson ( miss bates ) , kathleen byron ( mrs. goddard ) , phyllida law ( mrs. bates ) , polly walker ( jane fairfax ) and ewan mcgregor ( frank churchill ) . an uplifting , elegant film , ` emma ' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness . and even if it 's only through the magic of the silver screen , it 's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this , if only for a couple of hours , as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit . and that 's the magic of the movies . i rate this one 9/10 .
one of my favorite films for a number of years was `` last action hero '' ; unfortunately , arnold schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician ; so now i ca n't bear any film he may had a hand in . the adventures of jake speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in last ... hero ; so i was pleased to find it on dvd , so i could watch these themes played out so well . despite the `` plot-within-the-plot '' involving white slavery during an african nation 's civil war , this is not an action movie . the plot that the `` plot-within-a-plot '' is within , is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve : is jake speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader ; or is he actually a fictional character ( which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels ) ? i suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film , and that wayne crawford and andrew lane are perfectly aware of this . the film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional `` adventure-story '' universe . that 's actually a rich theme , the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film 's amiable and campy sense of humor . there are weaknesses to the film - primarily it 's cinematography , which makes the film look like a tv show . and the pacing does sag on occasion . but i really like these characters , and i enjoy the adventure they live , however silly . and i just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel . holds up under multiple viewings -m good show !
when i was a little girl ( and my dad owned a video store ) , this was among my favorite movies . i had n't heard much about it since then , nor did i really remember anything about it , it having been forgotten in the wake of don bluth 's other , probably better films . i managed to track it down a few weeks ago , however , and was pleasantly surprised again . set in new orleans in the 1930s , the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable . there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough , but they generally do n't detract from the storyline , which leaves you smiling ( and maybe even a little misty-eyed , if you are a lover of animals ) . the characters are believable ( maybe even a little too grown-up for younger watchers ) , as well . two paws up , and for those of you who have n't seen it in a while , definitely worth a re-watch .
larry burrows has the distinct feeling he 's missing out on something . ever since he missed a crucial baseball shot at school that cost the championship , he 's been convinced his life would have turned out better had he made that shot . then one night his car breaks down again . walking into the nearest bar to wait for the tow truck , larry happens upon barman mike , who unbeknown to larry is about to change his life for ever ....... the alternate life premise in cinema is hardly a new thing , stretching back to the likes of it 's a wonderful life and showing no signs of abating with the quite recent sandler vehicle that was click . it 's a genre that has produced very mixed results . back in 1990 was this james belushi led production , rarely mentioned when the said topic arises , it appears that it has largely been forgotten . which is a shame since it oozes charm and is not short in the humour department . we know that we are being led to its ultimate message come the end , but it 's a fun and enjoyable path to be led down . the film also serves notice to what a fine comedy actor james belushi was . i mean if his style of smart quipping and larking exasperation is n't your thing , ? then chances are you would avoid this film anyway . but for those engaged by the likes of red heat , k-9 and taking care of business , well mr. destiny is right up your street . along for the ride are linda hamilton , michael caine , jon lovitz , hart bochner , jay o. sanders , rene russo and courteney cox . mr. destiny , pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message at its heart . 7/10
i rented domino on a whim , not even knowing it was inspired by a true story , and even though it 's the least likely and true biopic you 'll probably see . i found it to be rather awesome . with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment . and once you 've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it . domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career . it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott . and with fast paced music and editing , it provides the visual flare to keep your attention , with slick performances and unexpected comedy , the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience . i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours .
this movie is an incredible piece of work . it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind , focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them . stellar performances all around . this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight . spend some real time with this one .
the premise of this anime series is about bread , of all things to base a plot on ! i truly laughed . the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with , and he goes off to bread baking school . i wish it were available on dvd , and it does n't matter if it 's subtitled or dubbed - it 's that good . even the theme song alone is funny . at one point in the theme song , there 's an african-japanese man with an afro on horseback , wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword . these images will not make sense unless you see the anime . you 'll laugh until your sides hurt . it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far .
this is an odd film for me , as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker ( far out by phil mucci ) , another writer/director , ryan jafri , contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film , the cure . i do n't normally review films this way , but what the heck -- i love shorts and could n't wait to see another . interestingly , while it turned out i did like the cure , i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know . to his credit , he encouraged me to review it anyway -- giving it my honest appraisal . the film has tremendous style and as far as jafri 's direction goes , it 's exceptional -- especially for such an inexperienced film maker ( it 's his first film ) . the combination of exceptional choices of color , pacing and music that well-suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere . you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making . however , the thing i did n't love was some of the writing . while the basic idea was great , the ending was just too easy to foresee . i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist . however , considering that this film is from someone who should n't be able to make such a professional film given his experience , it bodes well for his future . good job .
it was only on my second viewing , years later , that i realized two things about this movie : 1 ) i enjoyed it immensely , and 2 ) that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants . i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests -- valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness ( even * good * -natured airheadedness ) just are n't inherently funny , especially when drawn out to feature length . but though the movie 's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end , reeves and winter and sadler ( and hal landon jr. in an unforgettable scene ) display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily-scripted jokes ( e.g . ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell ) work as effortlessly as the witter ones ( e.g . the challenge ) . and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted ( who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie , disaster if they 're not well-matched ) appears utterly unstrained . ( side note : i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining -- sightly different comic sensibilities there , it seems . ) i give it a 7.75 . surprisingly good fun .
very good western.this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film , also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer . it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl . robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer , but people are worried that he will go too far , also about the harm that he will do to the town´s businesses . there are some similarities in the story with `` warlock '' which was made in 1959 . this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace , it really keeps you on the edge .
i 'm not great at writing reviews , so i 'll just spout my opinions ... i loved this series at first . the adventure , the action , the comedy , the drama ... i thought it was all brilliant . anderson , tapping , shanks , judge , davis ... i loved them all . davis , it seemed , was the fifth-most important person in the cast . not a big deal . but when his character ( general hammond ) left at the end of the seventh season , and anderson 's character ( colonel o'neill ) moved from the field to the office , the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff . i do n't know whether it 's because hammond was more important that i realized or what , but for some reason , after the seventh season , the series turned to * * * * . the first seven seasons , though , were awesome . the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it , but it turned out to be , even if this was n't the original intention , a brilliant setup to the series . i recommend that you watch the movie first , then watch the first season of the tv series , then watch the movie again ( you 'll have a whole new appreciation of it the second time around , believe me ) , and then watch the rest of the tv series . the last three seasons of the series are n't nearly as good as the first seven , but that does n't mean they are n't good . it just means they 're a letdown if you 've gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons . after you have finished this series , be sure to watch the spin off series , stargate : atlantis . it is a worthy successor to this brilliant series . edit on 7-18-08 : i just found out that don s. davis died a few weeks ago . it is a great loss .
this is what we can do to each other . this is the sort that everbody should see at least once . it does not glorify world . it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed , mained and debased by war . the person on the `` other side '' eats sleeps , laughs and cry just as we do .
in life , we first organize stones ( piedras in spanish ) such as a career , family , friendship , and love . in this way , we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones , our small necessities . if you act in an inverse way , you will not have enough room for larger stones . the five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large `` stones '' in their lives . ramon salazar , a spanish motion picture director defines his first feature stones in this way . the film tells the parallel , conflicting trajectory of five women : anita ( monica cervera , 1975- ) , isabel ( angela molina , 1955- ) , adela ( antonia san juan , 1961- ) , leire ( najwa nimri , 1972- ) , and maricarmen ( vicky pena , 1954- ) .all are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or , worst , that are in their shoes . they are five cinderellas in search of prince charming and a new chance in life . the best story of these five cinderellas is that of anita ( monica cervera ) who also stars in `` 20 centimeters , '' `` busco , '' `` crimen ferpecto , '' `` entre vivir y sonar , '' `` hongos , '' and `` octavia .

this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal . it 's about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost . it is such a classic . the soundtrack is a++++ . you 've got living legends of metal in it . and marc price was great in this film . this is a must have for metal fans .
i remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993 . i was 8 at the time , and now at the age of 22 it feels weird to have seen this cult show start and end and to look back on it.the 90 's all of a sudden seem so far away , what a great decade . anyway i used to watch monstervision all the time , as i am a huge fan of monster flicks and horror films . it was like the 90 's version of chiller theater . if mst3k can get dvd 's why not joe bob 's show , at least monstervision was more interesting and informative . a lot of joe bob 's comments and info on the films were just hilarious . most of the movies shown on the show were b or c grade but it showed a lot of a house films as well like the hammer films from england which are top notch as well as many with the stop motion majesty of ray harryhausen . many were oddball flicks that you would n't see anywhere else like the the japanese sci-fi movies besides of course godzilla which is familiar to almost everyone and independent movies like metal storm and motel hell . with the new decade of film preservation and more independent minded directors , i think monstervision would be a good show for ifc to pick up , since they already have a hit with the ifc grind house show . i 'm sure this show will be picked up again for nostalgia reasons some day , i guess will have to wait and see . until then `` thats great television '' !
this is an important film . it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention . there 's a lot to like here . the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions . unlike a lot of recent american cinema , this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place . the dvd includes a lot of bonus features , and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing . when the film screened at sundance , it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry . this is a sunday morning coffee movie , not a friday night party movie . for the dedicated viewer , it 's a treasure trove .
it was `` the night he came home , '' warned the posters for john carpenter 's career-making horror classic . set in a small american town , halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers ' attempts to track down his sister laurie strode , and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal ways ... leaving poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael . this plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the 80s , 90s and continues to do so today , as well as a poorly received 2007 remake . the difference between them , and this , is , quite simply , that `` halloween '' is the best . made on a very modest , tight budget ... halloween changed the face of horror in 1978 and spawned the sub-genre of `` sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a knife/axe/chainsaw/ wielding psycho '' .
blood castle ( aka scream of the demon lover , altar of blood , ivanna -- the best , but least exploitation cinema-sounding title , and so on ) is a very traditional gothic romance film . that means that it has big , creepy castles , a headstrong young woman , a mysterious older man , hints of horror and the supernatural , and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term . it also means that it is very deliberately paced , and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement . if you love films like robert wise 's the haunting ( 1963 ) , but you also have a taste for late 1960s/early 1970s spanish and italian horror , you may love blood castle , as well . baron janos dalmar ( carlos quiney ) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional , unspecified european village . the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman , she soon after ends up dead -- the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them . this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy appetite for women . at the beginning of the film , yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated . meanwhile , dr. ivanna rakowsky ( erna schürer ) has appeared in the center of the village , asking to be taken to baron dalmar 's castle . she 's an out-of-towner who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry . of course , no one wants to go near the castle . finally , ivanna finds a shady individual ( who becomes even shadier ) to take her . once there , an odd woman who lives in the castle , olga ( cristiana galloni ) , rejects ivanna and says that she should n't be there since she 's a woman . baron dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay . she ends up staying , but somewhat reluctantly . the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns , which the baron 's brother , igor , is suffering from . unfortunately , the baron 's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre , blackish liquid . and furthermore , ivanna is having bizarre , hallucinatory dreams . just what is going on at the castle ? is the baron responsible for the crimes ? is he insane ? i wanted to like blood castle more than i did . as i mentioned , the film is very deliberate in its pacing , and most of it is very understated . i can go either way on material like that . i do n't care for the haunting ( yes , i 'm in a very small minority there ) , but i 'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror . one of my favorite directors is mario bava . i also love dario argento 's work from that period . but occasionally , blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times . there are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle . but the atmosphere of the film is decent . director josé luis merino managed more than passable sets and locations , and they 're shot fairly well by emanuele di cola . however , blood castle feels relatively low budget , and this is a roger corman-produced film , after all ( which usually means a low-budget , though often surprisingly high quality `` quickie '' ) . so while there is a hint of the lushness of bava 's colors and complex set decoration , everything is much more minimalist . of course , it does n't help that the retromedia print i watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that 's been left out in the sun too long . it appears `` washed out '' , with compromised contrast . still , merino and di cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals . for example , a scene of ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that 's shot from an exaggerated angle , and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only . there are also a couple ingmar bergmanesque shots , where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships , besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame . the performances are fairly good , and the women -- especially schürer -- are very attractive . merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity . schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres , with english titles such as sex life in a woman 's prison ( 1974 ) , naked and lustful ( 1974 ) , strip nude for your killer ( 1975 ) and erotic exploits of a sexy seducer ( 1977 ) . blood castle is much tamer , but in addition to the nudity , there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage , and of course the scenes mixing sex and death . the primary attraction here , though , is probably the story , which is much a slow-burning romance as anything else . the horror elements , the mystery elements , and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses , but in the end , blood castle is a love story , about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms ( often with physical threats or harms ) to be together .
personally , i find the movie to be quite a good watch . it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized . not only that , it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police do n't just go all out and wipe out triads . overall , the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture . nevertheless , the movie stays true to the real world , thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens . i 'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan . another good watch would be dragon squad . that movie has more guns than this , as in this movie there 's more knives than guns ( in fact i do n't remember seeing a single gun ) .
do n't get me wrong . `` goldeneye '' was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise . but the series had fallen into a fps rut . enter `` everything or nothing '' , which puts bond in third-person . when i wrote my earlier review for `` from russia with love '' , i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly . even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise , eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety . missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv , driving an aston martin , driving a limousine that is wired to explode , commandeering two different types of tanks a la `` goldeneye '' , riding a motorcycle , flying a helicopter , repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires , and free falling after a plummeting damsel . sure , vehicle controls are a little clumsy , but the issue here is the variety . as movie adaptations , `` goldeneye '' and frwl were all that i could have hoped for . but eon 's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure . this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe , shannon elizabeth , heidi klum , and misaki ito . judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q , respectively , and pierce brosnan , while no sean connery , adds credibility to the game 's proceedings . all characters resemble the stars , with the disappointing exception of heidi klum , who 's in-game model does n't do the real-life model justice . mya 's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes . the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies . willem defoe 's character is a former colleague of christopher walken 's baddie from `` a view to a kill '' . richard kiel appears as jaws , the hulking henchman from `` the spy who loved me '' and `` moonraker '' in three fight scenes , the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have . single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond . like bond , you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing . the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth , with plenty of wall and object cover . unfortunately , unlike frwl , only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging , so bond may end up crouching low when he 's supposed to be peeking around a corner , and vice-versa . the game also allows players to go into `` bond reflex '' mode . while you browse your inventory , everything around you will go into super slo-mo , allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with . while this takes some getting used to , eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular `` bond moments '' , such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath , and greatly add to the bond movie feeling . there are 3 available difficulty levels : operative , agent , and double oh . on operative , you can breeze through in a few hours . on agent , a few weeks . on double oh , a few months . the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission . garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear . some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints , but when all is said and done , no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie . multi-player , unfortunately , is not as thrilling . `` goldeneye '' still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game . eon 's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond 's . a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode . but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date . the ending , as with most bond games , is anticlimactic . while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game , the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing . also , levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error . still , for any serious bond fan , not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films .
there 's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  `` i was quite a hand with a slingshot , '' `` the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy '' ( full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face ) , `` go and sit with the concubines . '' and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan `` whatever you say . '' he even tries the old `` my kingdom does n't understand me '' routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point . so it 's probably a tribute to henry king 's direction that the film is n't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide . maybe it 's the censor-baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale 's husband and gets away with it !  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne 's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum . this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope , abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands , and the film does n't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty . it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law , where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives . unlike king david , which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul , david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan 's death , gregory peck 's performance grows in stature as david shrinks . susan hayward is pure hollywood pro , raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet ( why be naturalistic when you 've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake ? ) and kieron moore 's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you ca n't exactly blame david for putting him in harm 's way , but despite threatening to soft peddle the film does n't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death . with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s biblical epics . fox 's new dvd is a good transfer , including an incredibly hokey 'candid ' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film 's sole battle scene .
the delivery of some very humorous rude lines by pierce brosnan is alone worth the price of admission . he plays a kind of `` james bond 's psycho twin brother '' , separated at birth , no doubt . as an intense hit-man , his character is very sexual but even better , very funny . add the kind-hearted , uber-likable american `` guy next door ' , greg kinnear , to set up contrast . the myriad locations , vivid colors , and quick-witted humor provide great entertainment . hope davis is well cast as the `` gem of a wife '' . but the focus of the film is on the two fellows , a new `` odd couple '' , and that 's the part that works very well . have a great ( probably r-rated ) laugh , and look for the places where the story goes a little deeper .
this work is less about steve martin 's character davis , than it is about kline ( mack ) and glover ( simon ) , and kline and mcdonnell ( claire ) , but the dialog inserted via davis is pondering , contemplative , near-poetic existentialism at its best . he is witty , intelligent , and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content . the writers deserved an oscar . the performances are easy , relaxed , and natural ; just what you would expect from `` a list '' actors . martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent shopgirl , guiding you through life , love , and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness . kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film , and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing . this work deals with life in all aspects . it engenders a true emotional investment in its characters , and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed , after all , no matter what you believe , deep down . all in all ? this is delightful , with a gritty moment or two , and easy natural dialog which draws you in , assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work . it 's definitely worth your time , though it may not be every one 's top choice as friday/saturday night entertainment . i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited . it 's not typical , and was an unexpected surprise . another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein . the couples and friends hold detailed conversations , which feel and sound fully honest and ( again ) natural . i was very impressed with this work , and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon . it rates a 9.1/10 from ... the fiend : .
spoilers within . it appears that von trotta was a lot more at ease with what the balance of personal story versus history of the events than she was in her earlier film versprechen , das ( 1995 ) . the direction seemed carefully controlled , and visually i felt it was highly appealing - especially where the visual narrative was concerned ( the title-sequence blend and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters in the past ) . to clarify two points that many people have been confused by : firstly , lena did not sleep with goebbels . although this may have seemed implied , it was not the intent . von trotta told me so herself ! ( and she is a very nice lady , by the way ! ) secondly , the time-frame of events was in fact historically accurate ( the actual dates are shown on the close-up of the memorial ) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the film . there is evidence showing that goebbels was annoyed about having done this , and had planned to eventually recapture those he had set free . overall , what most impressed me most was that it was an original story from a much 'over-movied ' era . it seems a shame that it has taken such a long time ( for various reasons ) for this film to hit our screens . more of the same please , margarethe !
looking for quo vadis at my local video store , i found this 1985 version that looked interesting . wow ! it was amazing ! very much a ken russell kind of film -quirky , stylized , very artistic , and of course `` different . '' nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate , but as a wacky , unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career . he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of `` leading '' an empire -it was n't much fun , and fun is what he longed for . klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth . yes , nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance ; one of many who did so . at one point one of his henchmen murmurs : `` no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves . '' he got that right .
the only reason i 'm giving this a 9 is that the other kid actors who played tadashi 's tormentors were not up to the job . i presume they were just kids who happened to be the right age and handy , but they were not well coached , and their scenes were a minor annoyance . i say not to judge this by u.s. standards because it 's full of ambiguities and the kinds of equivocations that japanese culture readily embraces , and is not beholden to the black-hat/ white-hat moral constraints u.s. kids ' films are routinely subjected to . for example , there is a preciously funny moment when tadashi 's small band of yokai companions finds themselves let down and abandoned by the other yokai , and shojo -- the avuncular kirin herald -- does what many a stressed-out japanese adult would do . hint : this would not happen in a disney film . this picture also has the best product placement for beer you will ever see in a kids ' movie . early on , there 's a moment where a school teacher smacks a couple of bullies on the head with her attendance book . there was a tv commercial in japan a couple years before this movie came out . it was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who 's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room . his mother yells at him from downstairs to shut up . then , someone gives him a candy bar and he cheers up and sings a happy tune , but his mother comes in and tells him to shut up again and gives him a dope slap that leaves a dent in his forehead . i mention this commercial , because it was considered funny , and i did n't hear any objections to it while i was there . there is a lot more bloodshed and physical cruelty on screen in `` the great yokai war '' than one would find in a disney movie . as a parent , if this were a u.s. film , i would be up in arms about such things , although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture , which , of course , are also not black and white . since it 's a japanese movie , i accept that those cultural norms allow for imagery that would not get past the standards and practices cops in a u.s. production . however , i 'd probably be a little uneasy taking young kids to see it without giving them some sort of pre-show briefing and/or post-show debriefing about the violence and other off- color stuff , or i 'd wait till they 're older to show it to them .
i had started to lose my faith in films of recent being inundated with the typical genre hollywood film . story lines fail , and camera work is merely copied from the last film of similiar taste . but , then i saw zentropa ( europa ) and my faith was renewed . not only is the metaphorical storyline enthralling but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating . the narrator ( max von sydow ) takes you through a spellbounding journey every step of the way and engrosses you into europa 1945 . we have all seen death put on screen in a hundred thousand ways but the beauty of this film is how it takes you through every slow-moving moment that leads you to death . unlike many films it does n't cut after one second of showing ( for example ) a knife but forces you to watch the devastating yet sensuous beauty of a man 's final moments . i think we can all take something different away from what this movie is trying to say but it is definitely worth taking the time to find out what it all really means . i would love to talk more in depth about the film for any one who wishes to send me an email . enjoy it !
the name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about , so i taped this film during the early hours of the am . if you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men . this film clearly wants to show that germany and france can work together and be friends after ww i and how the germans came to the aid of the french miners much to the unbelief of the french townsfolk . the actors were all outstanding , with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine . there is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down . if you are a real film buff , this is a film you will not want to miss .
i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old , then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon . then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better , i thought it was a good movie then . fast forward to just a few weeks ago ( june 2006 ) when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles/video clips and it 's just not the same movie . i 'm sure it 's still good with the kids , but to us 20-30 somethings it 's definitely got `` cult status '' written all over it . it 's a shame that the original production went through a painful process ; if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today . maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be , but that 's for fox to decide . i 'm rambling here , i know . i still think it 's a great film , but it could be better than great .
i liked the quiet noir of the first part , the acting of pacino and cusak , especially their scenes together . the moodiness of the setting and the juxtaposition of the old pol and the idealistic youth was effecting . i wish bridget fonda had more scenes in the movie ; she was an earnest and appealing character . the film went off the rails for me when the assistant mayor starting snooping around the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly did n't want him meddling in . nobody in their right mind would meet a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard . here the story became implausible . something that i do n't understand : why did the cop and vito have a shootout if the latter was delivering info that could bring down the corrupt judge ?
while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer , i was in for a deep surprise with this film . while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish , ' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience . instead of the feel-good-happy-story , this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting , but also disturbing . most kids wo n't understand some of the darker moments in the film , which makes this film rather watchable for adults . i was also impressed with the cinematography , using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts . the musical score was once again solid , proving hans zimmer is the go-to guy when it comes to animated scores , and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams ' music .
i have personally seen many disney movies in my lifetime , though absolutely none of them match up in any way to bedknobs and broomsticks . although i personally would n't have crossed live-action with animation , it was an improvement on trying to dress people up as animation characters . the movie pits three evacuees from world war two who are sent to stay with a silent and socially awkward woman in the country . i would have to say that the casting was brilliant . angela landsbury made a perfect miss price , while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest . endings always surprise me and this was no exception . it was neither happy nor sad , though i do not know if this was intentional . the dialog was n't great , but considering it was designed to be a kid 's movie , that is alright . overall , i would give the performance nine out of ten , the dialog six out of ten , the casting nine out of ten and the costumes eight out of ten .
i will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone ! the fact is it was n't what anyone was expecting , especially from guy ritchie . what everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners `` do ya like dags ? '' etc , but this is far more mature than his previous works . i would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder , this film demands all your attention ! look past the cool and dazzling look of the film , try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film . yes this has its influences from modern classics ( fight club , pulp fiction etc ) but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none . i feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney `` masterpieces '' .
i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same . mainly because of my feelings at the end . i and all the people around me were simply touched . this is something you do n't often feel . we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality , lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films . the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard , a man on the verge of a breakdown . this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous , humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie . the acting from branagh and bonham-carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role . the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie . the title comes from richards masterpiece , a plane made of junk and his old paintings . flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end . a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone . do n't let the subject matter put you off .
eric stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as joel garcia , a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident . while learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition joel befriends slick , fast-talking , charming womanizer raymond ( an amazing wesley snipes ) and boorish , surly , racist biker bloss ( a terrific william forsythe ) , who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he 's forced to share a room with . joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving , but married girlfriend anna ( radiantly played by helen hunt ) . but he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own . this remarkable movie 's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through . directors neil jimenez ( who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script ) and micheal steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste , wit and warmth , specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one 's lifestyle , including and especially your sex life ( this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when joel and anna try and fail to make love in a motel room ) . besides the expected poignancy , the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw , earthy humor that 's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with joel and bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club . the uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus : stoltz , snipes , forsythe and hunt are all outstanding , with stand-out supporting turns by grace zabriskie as bloss ' doting , amiable mother and elisabeth pena and william allen young as compassionate hospital nurses . despite the grim subject matter , the film ultimately proves to be a very moving , positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit . a simply wonderful little gem of a drama .
i consider myself a huge movie buff . i was sick on the couch and popped in this film . right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors , i 'd never seen , say great word . the filming was beautiful . it was just what i needed . i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others . the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout . thanku for making a film like this one . just wonderfully awkward , beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once . just great . i ca n't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director , more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer . i did n't want it to end . the end
i used to write comments at imdb , but i do n't do so anymore . it happens that imdb has become massive , and consequently subjectiveness has ruined scores . what do i mean ? that anyone that is not particularly fond of movies and does n't have any expertise on the subject , watches some crap ( or the opposite ) , and in case he likes it , delivers a 10 , and if he does n't he goes for a 1 . this of course , can not measure anything correctly . now for the film . i truly regret ever having delivered any 10s to some very few films , because then i must score this one with 12 or 13 , which is not possible . this documentary has something that i do n't expect to watch ever again in my whole life in any other film . it is simply mesmerizing , and it 's not just a way of saying ; it really is . the last 25 minutes have a load of energy , visual rejoice and wisdom -the words spoken by the starring guys- , that really ... there 's no possible match . i do n't keep movies , rarely would i find any sense in doing so , but this one is the kind of film you should buy and keep , and watch from time to time , maybe 10 or 20 times as years go by . i got nothing more to say . this is a genuine , objective 10 for me .
this movie scared me so bad , i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever wasnt scared by this movie , im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary , i hope everyone sees it , but dont see it with the lights off like i did ....
after just having watched the deer hunter , which is a masterpiece , the movie jacknife had big shoes to fill.it has same themes as the deer hunter , the devastating effects on a person after the vietnam war.robert de niro is in this film , as in the deer hunter and is very good here , as is kathy baker.but this movie belongs to ed harris , who gives a powerful , emotional and impactful performance.the movie is based on a stage play , and there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to me.by that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage play.that was not that big a deal , and does n't really diminish the film.i actually really liked this movie.it 's not an epic like the deer hunter.they are about similar era and have similar themes , but they are two very different films.i thought the deer hunter was great , and i also think this movie was great.it 's the acting in this one that makes it so great.for me , jacknife is a 10/10
clever , gritty , witty , fast-paced , sexy , extravagant , sleazy , erotic , heartfelt and corny , footlight parade is a first-class entertainment , what the movies are all about . the realistic , satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking . to think that they only started making feature talking pictures 7 years before this ! the brilliance of the dialogue can not be matched anywhere today , especially considering that `` realism '' has taken over and engulfed contemporary cinema . this film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh , self-referential , critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age . i 'd recommend watching any film from this period , that is 1930-1935 , for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be .
oh dear . yet another example of `` oireland `` and religion . no doubt we 'll be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some `` hunky and macho freedom fighters `` from the ira . well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later i was in a state of shock . what a superb movie the story starts on the day of the wedding between sean cloney and sheila kelly in the 1950s . there is a slight problem since they 're getting married in the catholic church and that is sheila is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen sheila takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and attend the catholic school when they 're old enough . the story - which is set in the 1950s - then jumps forward a few years when the cloney daughters are about to start school but sheila has decided they 'll be attending the local protestant school much to the disgust of local priest father stafford . from there things escalate let me put my cards on the table and state that despite having both irish catholic and scottish protestant heritage i was brought up as agnostic and have considered myself as an atheist throughout my adult life . in fact when it comes to religion i consider myself a marxist and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate people . a love divided shows what happens when self appointed moral guardians take it upon themselves to tell other people what to think and believe . may i have the temerity to state that if karl marx saw this movie he 'd love it and call it a masterpiece ? perhaps i should n't since the drama of this story shows what happens when other people do your thinking for you in reply to the couple of reviewers who have claimed this movie is propaganda of the worst sort i do n't claim to know the exact details of what happened in county wexford and there 's no denying that father stafford and his flock of catholic sheep are portrayed as being the bad guys but sheila is n't blameless herself . think about a woman living in a rural village in 1950s ireland who takes a pledge to bring her children up as catholics then changes her mind and believes there will be no consequences of this ? this is a warning against taking pledges and not keeping to them . not only that but she disappears to let other people pick up the pieces of their shattered lives . there 's also something that no one else has picked up upon and that is that the only character with any type of moral sense is former ira man andy bailey who is shown as being gallant not because he was a former ira member ( that makes a change . we 're not talking about the devil 's own here ) but simply because he is an atheist who has decided to think for himself a love divided is a superb movie that has a lot to say for itself , all of which i agree with . if there 's any sort of criticism it 's that it feels too much like a tvm rather than a cinematic movie but believe me i can live with that and is essential viewing to anyone who thinks religion is the opium of the masses
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie , and this movie is no exception . some movies i love did poorly at the box office but , i 'm glad to say , this movie is n't one of them ( over nine million dollars , which i do n't think was bad for back then ) . the characters were fun , the animation was clear and not fuzzy , and the music was modern , too , which is unusual for an animated movie . i did n't think professor screw eyes or his `` scary cirus '' was too scary for little kids ( the targeted audience for this movie ) , but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids ' movie . overall , this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years .
bill and ted are back , only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil bill and ted to destroy them , thus destroying 'wyld stallions ' and the basis for human society in the future . this time bill and ted have to travel through the afterlife 'totally bogus ' and save humanity 'excellent ' with much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper , station and robot bill and ted ( stations creation ) bogus journey once again entertains , and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone . 7/10 a most triumphant sequel party on dudes ! hehe
i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary . the musical score , cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production . even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters , it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system . in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system . the subject is also so fascinating . it is about mario andretti and his son michael . i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship , f1 championship , the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500 . the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son . the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection . the other car is michael 's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season . imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating . paul newman , who was michael amoretti 's team owner at the time this movie was made , narrates the film . his anecdotes and witticism , drawn from many years as an owner and driver , lends much to the production . the main feature is the race scenes . turn up the volume here ! there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget . wow ! the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family . this god of the racing world , mario andretti , is loving father who proudly watches over his son 's career . they work together so well that every father and son should see this . you can tell that they are a close family . i wish we could all have that experience .
i have seen just about all of miyazaki 's films , and they are all beautiful and captivating . but this one rises above the rest . this movie totally impressed me ! i fell in love with pazu and sheeta , and their sweet , caring friendship . they were what made the movie for me . of course , the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly . but the characters are the shining point in this movie : they are so well developed and full of personality . now , let me clarify : i 'm really talking about the japanese version of the movie ( with english subs ) . while the english dub is good ( mostly ) , it simply pales in comparison to the original language version . the voices are better , the dialogue , everything . so i suggest seeing ( and hearing ) the movie the way it originally was .
this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it 's a very enjoyable , light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time . highly recommended for it 's feel-good factor alone . ok , so frank sinatra 's `` acting '' leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film . sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this , his first venture into hollywood , his voice , not his acting , is his main contribution to this movie . i 've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago .
the movie freddy 's dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on elm street , yes it has comedy essence about it , so has all the other films , but how can anyone possibly say that you would n't find freddy krueger scary , if you were to come across this man in your dreams you would n't find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he does n't care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny , and freddy also plays comic mind games with them , which in its own way is very disturbing , by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies nightmare on elm street what they are today , the writers are extremely clever making krueger comic and scary as oppose to jason vorhees , who does n't say anything and has n't got the wit to truly frighten his victims , this movie is about as good as freddy 's wit gets and i would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour and by the way `` do n't fall asleep ! `` .
the secret of kells is one of the most unique , beautiful , and eye- popping animated films i have ever seen . before watching this film , i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category , but i found in kells a serious contender . the secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan , who lives with his uncle , the abbot of kell . the abbot is a loving guardian , but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy 's imagination . when the legendary brother aidan ( who looks surprisingly like willie nelson ) shows up and takes the boy under his wing , brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him ( and saves his life more than once ) . with aisling 's help , he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into light . see my full review of the secret of kells at : http : //theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html
despite its budget limitations , this is a great film , proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash . the opening , in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings , is a nice red herring . after that , a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which , in turn , causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg ( maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this is n't the first time such a thing has happened ) . when the prehistoric beast appears , it 's a well-animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area . alright , so it 's not jurassic park , but it 's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies .
i admit i 've only seen about three of shakespeare 's plays ( romeo & juliet , macbeth , & of course hamlet ) one i liked , the other i found so-so ( macbeth ) , and hamlet i just found a masterpiece . i 'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play . the acting is extremely strong ( with a cast that features kenneth branagh , robin williams , and billy crystal how can you lose ? ) and the change in time period ( looks like somewhere between the 17 and 1800 's ) plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from . if you 're into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful 1996 adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh .
scott is right . the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie . the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good . however , the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies . chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value . especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies , japanese movies excel , example being the lone wolf and cub series . even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most , the sheer intensity of those moments made them better . but , this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese . the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever . the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene . if you have n't seen it , you have to . john woo is the man .
this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life . to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the homo-sexual revolution , and not just gay as a descriptor . or is it still used that way today ? i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 . it was released in 1993 , so it 's been around . i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man 's love for another over a 20 some odd year period . a love expressed in ways that only true love can be . there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain , along with scenes of joy and pleasure . there are scenes of life as a homo-sexual and life as a gay . the film itself was a work of love , and i believe it to be a diamond . at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids . as i write this , i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set . the advances in medical , political , and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film was set ( some 15 years ago ) are amazing . however , obviously , in the case of the disease of aids itself , we are not done yet . heck i guess we are n't done on all fronts . anyway , it 's just a pretty darn good documentary . i 'd encourage anyone that feels that they do n't quite understand gay life , gay issues , or the devastation of aids to watch this film .
if jean renoir 's first film `` whirlpool of fate '' first takes us into the world of the countryside , the rivers , the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore , it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged , the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards . put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great `` grand illusion '' and `` rules of the game . '' this is beautifully filmed , with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film 's interiors , and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well , particularly from werner krauss ' muffat . but the glamorous and sultry ms. hessling , who at first appears as if she might give louise brooks a run for her money in vampishness , never goes beyond a one note , selfish harlot portrayal . perhaps this is in part a problem with the script , which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions ; not having read the novel i 'm not really clear on whether the choices were well-made or not . still , the differences between nana 's suitors are well-drawn , and i particularly liked the relationship between muffat and jean angelo 's vandeuvres -- the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other , particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where vandeuvres warns muffat , and we wonder if violence will erupt -- this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has . far from his greatest achievement , and for me probably just shy overall of `` whirlpool of fate '' , this is still well worth seeing for renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally .
it has been some years since i saw this , but remember it and would like to see it again . it kind of became a `` therapy '' for me with a personal experience of my own . a thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he `` missed the ball '' and his team lost . he thinks about it 20 years later , `` if only i 'd hit that ball '' and how his life would be better because of it . then , he gets a chance to find out .... and gets a little more than he bargained for . it reminds me so much of when i was in high school , i twice tried out for our drill/dance team and did n't make it . this team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school . if you were on it , you were `` all that . '' i did n't try out till my last two years of hs and after the second time , i took it really hard . i 'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise , and that caused me to not make it . that was in 1987 . through the years , even now sometimes , i think `` if only i had n't hit my leg i would 've never worn those stupid tights . '' now i do n't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it , but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past . who knows , it could have changed the course of events to the point that i would n't have met my son 's father . i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change . be careful what you wish for ! ! !
i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action films . i 've seen all of the animated films , but out of the bunch , this is the poorest , and it 's rather disappointing . `` mask of the phantasm '' would rank as the best , then `` world 's finest '' , then `` sub zero '' , then `` return of the joker '' , and finally this ranks last . in this newest animated movie , there 's a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether she 's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance . but as bruce gets involved with three young women , he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl . the tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak , which was rather disappointing . bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time , the villains are re-used from the last films , and while the action scenes are exciting , they 're really nothing new . it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have , especially that of `` sub-zero '' which was heavy in drama and character development . everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for . all the while , i really enjoyed this , i had a blast , and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising , but this was n't as exciting as i 'd hoped .

my left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of christy brown , who had cerebral palsy , a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot , but he was defiant , he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds i have seen this film a lot of times and each time i see it , i find it equally brilliant each time.i wonder how did this amazing film not win an oscer for best picture , it is a shambles by the academy awards . jim shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world.the screenplay , the music and anything else is excellent in this film . as the film goes on , you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.ray macanally and brenda fricker are amazing as cristies parents and fiona shaw is equally brilliant as d.r eileen cole , who helps christy on his battle of defiance . the irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.my left foot was the start of a wonderful period in irish film . films so powerful and brilliant such as the field , the crying game , in the name of the father and michael collins followed my left foot.these irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple oscers and won some , a wonderful period for irish film.my left foot is a powerful outstanding film . daniel day-lewis plays the crippled christy brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for hugh o conner who plays young christy.to me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances , especially daniel day-lewis 's performance which i would regard as high as antony hopkins in the silence of the lambs . daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor . this is an excellent masterpiece in film , see it !
eskimo is a serious movie about the cultural chasm between an indigenous population and the encroaching white man . although filmed in a documentary style seemingly with non-professionals , eskimo is a skilled production that contains a believable story the audience will want to see through to the final shot . the native eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life than do the whalers that darken his landscape . when an eskimo man loses his mate , it is natural that other men share their women with their friend . it is also usual for their women to want to take the place of the missing spouse . all of this seems natural in the context of the desolate foreboding arctic setting . the trusting eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous white whalers ( with heavy european accents ) that do not view these natives as their equals . deceit , drunken orgies , rape , and death occur after the eskimo men depart for work on the icy cold seas . eventually the lead eskimo ( mala ) realizes that he has been duped and he takes his revenge . the audience would have cheered in the 1930 's theaters . enter the royal canadian mounted police and the moral dilemma of whether to bring back mala for trial . the mounties are played as feeling policemen that know this is not a cut and dry case . will the mounties get their man ? is it fair to hold mala to a code of behavior outside of his traditional society ? is there a way out that does not punish mala ? is it inevitable that the white man 's law must prevail ? is there no hope for innocence ? this is not a great movie , but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue addressed in a very different setting . i suspect that the filming of the sequences with animals was done before today 's disclaimer that none were injured in the making of the film -- so beware of the raw nature sequences . highly recommended .
when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it . it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview , its stunning , and then when it comes out , you hear nothing and totally miss it , and your memory totally does n't correct the mistake of missing it . man on fire was one of those movies . i was curious on a rental one time , and i decided to take it home with me , my precious blockbuster rental in my hands . i watched it , and witnessed such a beautiful movie . it is like none other ... drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular . the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique , unlike another movie . the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices , and the music is very intriguing for the setting . i got into this movie , and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy . i 've watched it several times now . denzel washington ( creasy ) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live . dakota fanning ( pita ) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start . they bond and become good friends , until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood , la hermandad . creasy ( denzel ) tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers , fearing that pita is dead . this is where creasy really shows the person he can become . he uses his contacts from pita 's kidnapping and creasy 's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit . my favorite line of all , is in this movie , when christopher walken tells the afi agent that `` a man is a work of art , in anything that he does .... cooking , whatever . creasy 's art is death ... he 's about to paint his masterpiece . '' he plays a very unique roll of creasy 's old partner and friend . after finally pursuing the brother of `` the voice , '' leader of la hermandad . creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice 's brother . in the end , creasy dies from being shot earlier , and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss . it is a very sincere and sad ending , but a great one . i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick . the story is in depth , everything is explained from beginning to end , and nothing corny at all in any way or manner .
first , nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly . not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard-boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ( ghost trains ) as a child . second , the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future . third , this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes , eva mendezes , and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb-lights are . mrs. christian is not a light , but a sun . however , `` dark remains '' is also of considerable metaphysical importance . they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and `` imagination '' that are not visible with one ' own eyes is not new . but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times . this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality ( by which reality turns into a sign ) , but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the `` real '' reality can . being a sign , the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects , i.e . the sign behaves like an object . now , in our usual world of perception , it is common that objects change signs . f.ex. , if someone grows a bird , his photograph will show him with beard , not without , as it did before . but the opposite , the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man . this is , very simply expressed , the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison , in this movie . this is new , and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well-known , mostly since the silent time .
i love this movie , but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid . the fateful game took place in 1972 . that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 . but almost all of the music played at the dances etc . is from the 1950s and very early 1960s . having just attended my 30th high school reunion , i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents ' music . i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically . but it was n't completely bereft , and the producers of the film should have taken more care . i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film . this was a bad director and/or producer decision .
gary busey is the title character , frank `` bulletproof '' mcbain , your standard-issue reckless maverick cop who 's earned his nickname because no matter how many bullets he takes ( 38 and counting ) , he never stops going after the bad guys . when a cutting-edge u.s. tank dubbed `` thunderblast '' is driven across the border into mexico , it 's nabbed by revolutionaries / terrorists led by general brogado ( rene enriquez ) and libyan colonel kartiff ( henry silva ) , who 's aligned himself with russian villains . the army personnel involved are kept as prisoners , chief among them devon shepard ( darlanne fluegel ) , who happens to be mcbain 's ex-girlfriend . mcbain is then recruited by the army for a rescue mission . busey may not have the physical presence of say , someone like schwarzenegger , who would have been another appropriate lead for a film of this type , but he 's a blast as a self- confident dude who 's quick with the wisecracks . fluegel is a great female lead ; she not only looks incredibly sexy but makes for a fine butt-kicking action babe . enriquez , silva , juan fernandez , and the always welcome william smith ( as a russian major ) are loathsome scum in the classic action movie tradition . the supporting cast is quite full of familiar and reliable character actors : l.q . jones , r.g . armstrong , thalmus rasulala , lincoln kilpatrick , mills watson , luke askew , danny trejo , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa . t.l . lankford and b.j . goldman supply the script , based on a story by lankford and veteran b director fred olen ray . it 's the kind of script where you just know the writers have their tongues in their cheeks : they know their material is absurd and cheesy , and just have fun throwing credibility out the window . veteran action director steve carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire , explosions , and general all-out mayhem . `` bulletproof '' is good fun for the action fan who does n't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor . 7/10
the dazzling seventeen-minute dance sequence of george gershwin 's 1928 orchestral piece , `` an american in paris '' , is an indisputable masterwork . choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by gene kelly , the vibrant combination of color , music and dance is still eye-poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists - dufy in the opening place de la concorde piece , manet in the flower market , utrillo in a paris street , rousseau at the fair , vincent van gogh in the spectacular place de l'opera piece , and toulouse-lautrec for the moulin rouge where kelly wears his famous white bodysuit . the 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting , not by a long shot , but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 oscar-winning musical . director vincente minnelli and screenwriter alan jay lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on jerry mulligan , a former g.i . who has remained in paris after the end of wwii trying to make a living as a painter . with his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style , gene kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality , but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree jerry . the love-triangle plot is focused on jerry 's involvement with milo roberts , a self-proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists . on their first date in a crowded montmartre nightclub , jerry unapologetically falls for lise , a young woman who turns out to be the fiancée of henri , a professional entertainer and friend of jerry 's pal , adam , an out-of-work concert pianist . romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic gershwin songs are performed . the best of these is the most imitated - a swooningly romantic song and dance to `` our love is here to stay '' along a faux-seine river in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights . the way kelly and leslie caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch . few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love . `` i got rhythm '' and `` s'wonderful '' spotlight kelly 's nimble tap-dancing and agreeable singing , while `` embraceable you '' is danced impressively by caron in a five-scene montage of henri 's all-over-the-map description of lise to adam . designed to show off caron 's dancing versatility , the sequence is similar to the one in `` on the town '' where vera-ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when kelly 's sailor character described his multi-faceted vision of miss turnstiles . as lise , the nineteen year-old caron ( in her first film ) dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years . looking quite glamorous , nina foch plays older as the manipulative milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate , while oscar levant is just his sardonic self as adam . performing an elegant `` i 'll build a stairway to paradise '' , george guétary plays henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end . this is not the best all-around mgm musical , but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile . the 2000 dvd contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras .
i 'll be honest with yall , i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i did n't think i would like it at all . but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it , plus their was something else with it i liked . the acting was great , not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines , john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy . this was a great show to watch , and i 'll tell you why it was a great show . my father who never watches sitcoms at all , he just watches movies , sports , and law & order , he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters , my mother , and myself , and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it . i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he had n't passed away .
the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships - first and foremost an adult son and his father , but also that son with his wife , his sisters and his mother . paul reiser has written a semi-autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father . the movie is funny , poignant and thought-provoking . it led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my now-deceased father and my adult son . peter falk is excellent as paul 's father - the role could not have been better cast . i hope that both mr. falk and mr. reiser are recognized in next year 's movie awards for their efforts - falk for his performance and reiser for his script .
it 's utterly pointless to rate this film . it 's as if you would condemn ( or praise ) the newly born for his future life . instead look at it as a powerful meditation at what could have been and what has been in the past 100+years . one hundred and eight years of the cinematograpy : what has become of the babe ? i like to contemplate on what would have ( creatively ) happen if europe was n't interrupted ( devastated ) twice by the great wars of the xxth century . on her ruins the bogus neon castle of the non-creative and reactionary circus named hollywood erected itself . before 1914 french , italian and scandinavian cinemas were leading the way both financially and of course creatively . french film in particular was already threading some very original and creative pathways that could have ( if not interrupted ) possibly altered the medium history in some unimaginable ways . one wonders what the film history would look like today if it was n't stultified and choked by the mercantile and cheap political agenda of the hollywood 's 80+ years of , what chekhov might define as the reek of greed and harlotry ... be it as it might , please at least become aware of la sortie as the key ( or at least one of them ) to the `` kingdom '' . thus the birthplace of cinema : lumiere brothers factory , lyon , france the date : march 19th 1895 ( there 's also a replica reel shoot in the summer of 1895 so if you notice summer lights and the workers ' lighter clothing : that was the version shown to the very first people who ever saw the moving images . * louis lumiere : creative ideas , cinematography , direction it was all louis ' own domain because auguste took care of the rest ( money ) . * first film reels were all fifty seconds long : the camera ( =le cinematograph ) & the cameramen ( le cinematographer ) having only paltry fifty seconds to make things happen ! * apparently le institute lumiere has managed to preserve around 1500 of these first films executed mostly by an industrious brigade of loumiere travelling cinematographers criss-crossing the globe . * * * so , all the stars in starry heavens and a minute of silence for perhaps the most magical invention in human history ( so far ) .
this is one of disney 's top five animated features , in my opinion . cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film ( as opposed to the compilation films of the 40 's ) , and expensive depth via the multi-plane camera returns to the film in no other way . although disney adapts the story somewhat liberally , you gather the idea of the era via the dress and set stylizations -- -a clear time period the story takes place . cinderella is more mature than snow white , and a multi-dimensional character . actually , all of the characters are somewhat well-developed , except for the prince -- left the most flat -- we know he has a sense of humor , and a great smile , but that 's about all . like snow white , disney has some permanent impact on the story in popular culture -- -in most versions of cinderella , the stepsisters are attractive , just not as pretty as cinderella , and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance . favorite disney additions : the mice ! also , appreciated the continuity -- cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film . the addition of the homemade gown as well as the following assault from the stepsisters was always horrific as a child -- i remember view master showing this with a black background and a large red light on it ! the broken slipper shows the unwillingness of evil lady tremaine to give up her hold over cinderella and admit defeat -- -audley would go on to characterize the most wicked of all disney villains , satanic witch maleficent , in sleeping beauty .
like his early masterpiece `` the elephant man '' lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight , simple story without losing his artistic touch . this is a true story of an elderly retired man ( expertly played by richard farnsworth ) who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at death 's door . a beautiful score from badalamenti , exquisite photography of rural life ( love those aerial corn-field shots ) , and a sly director 's hand that reveals man 's basic humanity , this is a beautiful slice of life film . its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep , but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end .
i think the weighted average for this film is too low . i give it a 7 . very entertaining , although over the top in a few places . my wife says it passes the danielle steele test . superb performances throughout , particularly by andie macdowell .
an excellent movie . superb acting by mary alice , phillip m. thomas , and a young irene cara . tony king was very realistic in his role of satin . this movie was one of the last predominately `` all black '' movies of the 70 's and unlike the `` blaxploitation '' movies of that era , this movie actually had a plot , and was very well done . the movie soundtrack , sung by aretha franklin , was popular on the r & b charts at the time .
i loved this flick when it came out in the 80 's and still do ! i still quote classic lines like `` say it again '' and `` you said you 'd rip my balls off sir '' . ron leibman was hot and very funny ! although it was underrated and disowned by mad , i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island ! i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out ! if you like cheesed out comedy , this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic ! it is military humor at it 's best and worse ! rent it if you ca n't own it !
i generally love these 1930 mystery/police charlie chan type of movies , and this is no exception . however , something seems bad with this movie . a late attempt to switch from cerebral moto movies centered around the plot contrivances to a salad bar spoilt by comedy relief that is as relieving as sore feet . a typecast buffoon appears from nowhere impersonating a clumsy englishman who plays the detective , and even other characters seem entangled into providing comedy relief . the plot may seem odd or a bare excuse to us today , but back then the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real , but a commonplace occurrence .
while the story is sweet , and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy , the uniqueness of the film ( and what makes it a masterpiece ) is the dream sequence . it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music ( gershwin ) , the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art , kelly 's enthralling choreography ( including his rapturous `` pas de deux d'amour '' , really a separate genre ) , with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set . matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist .
i had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently . i believe that it will be in theaters in canada some time around mother 's day . if it is in a theater near you ... go ! it 's not a funny feel-good movie - it 's more along the lines of a feel and think movie . the director does an excellent job of character development - letting you into the heart , mind and hurts of hagar little by little . at first , her attitudes and behaviors do n't make much sense . as her story unfolds , she becomes someone you can understand . as in life ... understanding brings empathy . i found her likable by the end of the movie - particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man in the shack by the lake . hagar 's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflective of so many of our own experiences in this world . her youngest son , john , who is full of life and adventure takes the viewer to the very edge of their seat - and into the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and rare . it 's fun to see ellen page acting in this movie . she is so very different than the young woman that she plays in juno . it gives me an even broader appreciation for her acting ability . if you loved her in juno , you 'll love her in the stone angel . of course , there is ellen burnstyn as hagar . there is likely no way of expressing the power of acting as strongly as the ability for the actor to make you forget every other character they have ever played . never once in the course of this movie did i ever think of ellen burnstyn - i always and only thought of hagar . she swept me into her character - hook , line and sinker . kari skogland 's capacity to capture on film this renowned book by one of canada 's most cherished authors is impressive . she brilliantly brings to the screen both the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman , hagar - the stone angel .
a few years ago , a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat ' on it . after we finished that movie , and were about to stand up , we saw that there is another film just after , tough on the cassette 's envelope the owner did n't write it up . yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening , which lacked credits . some two hours later , i just sat there wondering : how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before ? ... this film was europa . lars von trier woke film noir from the dead , deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets , yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war german photographs i saw . and then the tricky cuts ! the story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end . a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post-war germany , intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped . but he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance . he hires with zentropa , a dining-and-sleeping-car company ( modeled on mitropa ) , whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash . our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf , nazi post-war terrorists . when he does n't understand the world ( or just europeans ) anymore , in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved . as a final note , for historical correctness : in the real world , the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies , they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup . after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied-occupied aachen , two months before the capitulation , the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines , the werewolf . but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training , and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants , with hitler 's death and the war 's end it all fell apart . however , the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers . they feared the werewolf everywhere , suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later ( ignored by some recent pseudo-historians ) . for example , when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed-out bremen , or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin . the effect was strongest on the soviets , who arrested tens of thousands ( in large part children ! ) 'preemptively ' on suspicion of being werewolf , and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died .
there has never been anything like it , that 's for sure . this episodic , seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole , and as such it is not a movie about groovin ' gary , utah cross-dressing sensation . it is very self-consciously a film about how the filmmaker reacts to groovin ' gary . for harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance . he 's trying to atone for his sins - yes , gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired - through correction , commentary , and convention , reclaiming such hollywood-narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending ( two different ones , with a telling adjustment in the glover version ) and turning them to his own very personal uses . so while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference , the structure ensures that it is also a movie about movies - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity . there is just so much going on ; in telling and re-telling this story harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row , and he does n't miss the opportunity to make something of it . immensely moving , and as profound as camp ever gets .
i do n't know what movie some of these other people watched , but they must have seen a different `` joseph smith : prophet of the restoration '' than the one i saw . i think the movie was both well-done and inspiring . i think it 's definitely worth watching . it 's apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film . the background scenery is beautiful . i think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet . joseph 's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence . i would definitely recommend watching this movie .
sergio martino 's the case of the scorpion 's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70 's heyday of the genre . an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife . the money is subsequently snatched by a black-clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow . scorpion 's tail plays the mystery element , written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi , fairly straight . but , being a giallo , the murders themselves are memorable and well-staged . in fact , the violence in this movie is very strong in places - a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic . the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory . but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography . the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone 's avant-garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right . the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales - in this case london and athens - where martino manages to get in , respectively , the houses of parliament and the acropolis ! there is also some inventive camera-work too , the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside . in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento 's crystal plumage , however , it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria . so martino 's film is influential in its own right . this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non-genre fans can appreciate . the performances are good and the production values are fine ( although the plane explosion is , shall we say , somewhat low-budget ! ) . the dvd release by noshame is nice . it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus . however , it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option . this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras . this is a minor point though , the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection .
i first discovered alexander korda 's ( 1940 ) fantasy , the thief of bagdad in the early 1950 's on a re-issue billed as `` the wonder show of the century ! '' both korda technicolor films , the thief of bagdad and jungle book were shown on one never to be forgotten program . the music of miklos rozsa enhanced both films . the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful ! the thief of bagdad has remained on my list as the best fantasy film ever made . as the years passed , it became more difficult to enjoy the film 's color in the way it had originally been presented in . true technicolor gave way to a eastman color process in the middle 1950 's . both kino and samuel goldwyn reissued the film both theatrically and on video . but the eastman color prints were more pastel in nature and muted the vibrancy of the original technicolor . the laser disc release of this title also has the pastel look to it -- nice , but not as it should be . now comes the m-g-m dvd ( 3 dec 2002 ) issue . the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd that is nothing short of stunning ! ! ! it was so exciting to see it like this once again that after viewing the dvd once , i watched it a second time . the only `` extras '' are a spanish dubbed version , sub-titles in both english & spanish , and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer . thank you m-g-m for this exceptional dvd release . now , one can only hope that korda 's four feathers and a restored version of korda 's jungle book ( to replace to poor public domain prints in circulation ) will soon follow on dvd .
greetings from this portuguese guy : ) i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever , it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way , that it 's hard to see the difference . it has the same quality as godfather ! james gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove ! i would love the sopranos would never finish at all . it 's perfect ! it should be a subject in school : ) i saw sopranos when i was a kid , but i was too young to stay waked until the episode ends , so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted , like i did with prison break . in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best-ever series made for television . the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect . congratulations for such a work . sorry about my english . thanks for reading .
excellent pirate entertainment ! it has all the good ingredients to keep one 's attention -- an absorbing tale of intrigue , a fiery lady pirate named spitfire stevens ( maureen o'hara ) who 's attracted to the irresistible mr. hawke ( errol flynn ) who is out on a secret mission of his own . they make a fine romantic pair onscreen -- sigh ! anthony quinn is the mean , bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer . i noticed the very familiar face of mildred natwick playing a supporting role as mrs. macgregor , the protector of young princess patma ( alice kelley ) . there is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines , ships , and the bay . lots of action too of sword fighting clashes , ship battles , daring leaps of errol flynn ( robin hood on board ship ! ) . from the flaming redhead herself i once heard in an interview of maureen o'hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo flynn in sword fighting in those days but there 'd be no need to put it to the test here . very enjoyable movie .
wilhelm grimm ( alexander knox ) stands trial for nazi crimes . three witnesses give evidence - father warecki ( henry travers ) , wilhelm 's brother karl ( erik rolf ) and wilhelm 's former lover marja ( marsha hunt ) - before wilhelm speaks in his own defense . the film ends after the court sums up .... the film is told in three flashback segments as each of the witnesses takes the stand . the story is mostly set in a small polish village and memorable scenes include the village reaction to the death of anna ( shirley mills ) , who wilhelm is accused of raping ; the treatment of the jewish villagers as they prepare to be moved to concentration camps ; and the church service where willie grimm ( richard crane ) denounces his nazi upbringing whilst mourning for his girlfriend janina ( dorothy morris ) , marja 's daughter , after she has been shot at a brothel . throughout the film , knox is unrepentant and is very convincing as a bitter , resentful and evil man . martha hunt has some powerful moments and matches him with her strength and henry travers is also very good in his role as a priest . this film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished .
i was the production accountant on this movie , and i also got to do some voice-over work on it , so i 'm not entirely unbiased , but if it were awful , i would say so . i thought it was a fun film , not a critically acclaimed masterpiece , by any means , but there were plenty of laughs along the way . the bible states that laughter does good like a medicine , so watching this movie could be good for your health . so many of the actors in this picture had n't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film . susan sarandon , of course , is one who has since gone on to much greater fame . melanie mayron was seen on tv on a weekly basis as a photographer in the `` thirty-something '' tv drama series . robert englund later became known as freddie krueger , still haunting people 's dreams . one of my personal favorite actors on this show was dub taylor , who played the sheriff . he was an excellent comedic actor , and a truly nice , sincere person . we all had fun working on this show , and i think that fun comes through .
ira levin 's deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film . therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play , one man who is a famous mystery playwright , another man who is a promising writer , the playwright 's wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been , and one german psychic along for the ride . director sidney lumet , no stranger to film , is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on . the dialog is quick , fresh , and witty . michael caine excels in roles like these . christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act . irene worth stands out as the funny psychic . how about dyan cannon ? love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around , but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive . but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now ? deathtrap is funny , sophisticated , witty , and classy . the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat , and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending , but watching caine and reeve under lumet 's direction with levin 's elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film .
tigerland / ( 2000 ) * * * 1/2 ( out of four ) by blake french : throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible , and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield . joel schumacher ( `` 8mm , '' `` a time to kill '' ) , easily one of the riskiest directors currently working , has found resemblance with `` the thin red line '' in the way his new drama `` tigerland '' steps in an individual soldier 's shoes . this movie , written by ross klavan and michael mcguther , has more guts and irony than `` the thin red line '' or even `` saving private ryan . '' although the movie 's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present , it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war . i would want to know joel schumacher 's experiences with the army . are the men really this unabashed and brutal ? i am sure some of them are , but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named roland bozz ( colin farrell ) , who is rebellious against the ideas of war . his personality instantly counteracts with several other characters , one who becomes his best friend , paxton ( matthew davis ) , and another , wilson ( russell richardson ) , whose flamed temper often exasperates bozz 's tension with the idea of going to war . the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield , but on training grounds of a louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training . this film is specifically about the preparation for war , nothing more nothing less . it ends when the soldiers finally go to war , kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff . shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget , joel schumacher accurately displays a gritty , perverse , cruel , and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held cinematography , unique lighting techniques and direct sound . schumacher 's grainy and blown-out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature . this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie , quite graphic in its use of coarse language , perhaps a little too disturbing . waves of four-letter words pound the audience , some in shock of what they are hearing . even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking , true , and emotional . if anything , `` tigerland '' provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat . such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war , knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken . such thought-provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees . this movie is not for all audiences , but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army ... and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such .
this movie works because it feels so genuine . the story is simple and realistic , perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most/all of us experienced during our teen years . the actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers . the dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references . also , the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful , bringing the lower east side setting to life in a very tangible way . on an artistic level , i love this movie because it reminds me of great italian neo-realism films like the bicycle thief and la strada . movies rarely feel as `` real '' as this does ... or as bicycle thief did . and the only other movie i 've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is elia kazan 's splendor in the grass . writer/director peter sollett deserves tremendous praise . this film is quite an achievement . on a personal level , i am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic america with love and respect . as an italian-american , i hate the way my own people come off in the cinema ( as racist , womanizing , criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics ) , and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations . hispanics and asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in westerns and action movies . ( good thing gong li did n't try to become famous in america ! ) of course , thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures , and the influence of miramax , we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but raising victor vargas is easily one of the best . while i do really like my big fat greek wedding , it is a refreshing change that raising victor vargas is played straight ( with less exaggerated and broadly-drawn characters ) while still being very funny in its own right . finally ! latino characters worthy of note . i have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered . of course , now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the dominican republic , i hope peter sollett gets around to making a movie about italians soon ! : ) - marc dipaolo
it 's nothing brilliant , groundbreaking or innovative , but 'dog days ' is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study . it 's like crash tripping on a bad dose of heroin , but not really . it 's an austrian film following the lives of several depressed , deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other . it 's disturbing , yet very well-acted and it 's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do . certainly not for the weak-hearted , this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end , we just see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days . grade : b
this film has a rotting core of flexible morality , and yet a quirky sense of justice . so many of the regular joes among us would love to `` stick it to the man '' . the `` man '' in this case is represented by several different characters . mr. keller , who carla reports to at her office . later , paul owes 70 large to mr. marchand the club owner . and then there is paul 's parole officer . there seems to be so much question about this last character 's side story . reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well crafted subterranean game of ping-pong between our two protagonists , escalating tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically . they are beholden to each agent of the `` man '' . one or both could be fired , killed , or imprisoned if they do n't do as they are told . the film has a sense of relief at the end . carla finally gets laid . her boss is forced out for being a jerk . mr. club owner is a pulpy mess in his own bathroom . they get the $ money $ . and ... they need not worry about reporting in to the parole officer , because his moral weakness leads him to stash his wandering wife in the basement ( or whatever the police found to arrest him ) . it is a critical subconscious trigger to the lock tumbler that wound us up so tight . never mind that someone else may get paul 's file later to supervise his release ; for the moment they are free ! they might even get away with it ! woohoo ... they stuck it to the man !
this movie gets it right . as a former usaf aviation cadet , i can tell you this movie has it all . the tedium of the application process . the waiting for word . the joy of acceptance . the worry about making it through the course . the sorrow of watching one 's buddies ( perhaps the best of them ) wash out . the anguish of paying the ultimate price - the death of fllow student airmen . the glory of graduation . always the flying , the flying , the flying . many are called but few are chosen . we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do .
in one of neil simon 's best plays . creaky , cranky ex-vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special . the problem is they have n't even seen each other in over a decade . full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes , this story flies along with a steady stream of humor . good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew , rosetta lenoire as the nurse , and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director . steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves . trivia note : the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of 1929 and shows marie dressler , bessie love , polly moran , cliff edwards , charles king , gus edwards , and the singing brox sisters .
anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends , they both are the leads in their own respective bands ; anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols . what 's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ; its a love hate relationship . at times you both hear them praising one another , but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are . while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success , bjm still was stuck in the underground scene ; and for good reason why . the focus of dig ! is more towards anton and the bjm , as they have a lot more substance . they are the most dysfunctional band . during gigs they will fight and bash each other . anton will hit other members if he feels they are n't performing correctly . with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume , fight was always waiting to happen . you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ; that 's why people would go to their gigs , for the fights . anton is very unstable . always thinking himself as a music messiah , he wants to change music and create a revolution , but he could never get out of the underground . he is a very talented musician , its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill . but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created ; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs , alcohol and depression . on the other side , the dandy warhols were having their own troubles . they did n't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label . but they found huge success in europe . but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton . its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed . courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton , though anton would n't say it , he needed the commercial success that the dandy 's had , to make his revolution . over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands , there is a lot of footage . there is never a dull moment in dig ! . it is constantly moving along as it does n't have time to slow down as it has to much to say , seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job . ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more . even if you do n't like the bands it still deserves viewing ; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure . you wont be disappointed .
brutal , emotionless michael myers stabs his sister to death at age six on halloween night in 1963 ; on october 30 , 1978 , he escapes from a mental institution and institutes a new reign of terror in his hometown of haddonfield , illinois . he is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist ( donald pleasence ) who knows just how evil this young man is . it opens with a bang , and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire . it 's subtle compared to the nasty bloodbaths many of those subsequent movies were ; subtle , and scary . it retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated viewings . how many movies are there , really , that can continue to be frightening even after one has seen them before ? not very many . pleasence is great in what was probably the definitive role of his career ; jamie lee curtis , in her motion picture debut , became a bona fide scream queen after acting in `` halloween '' as well as a few subsequent slasher pictures , and she is an intended victim worth rooting for . co-writer / director john carpenter knows what works in this movie , making excellent use of shadows and dark skies ; notice how most of the movie is set after nightfall . with this picture , he and his former collaborator debra hill created a franchise that has spawned seven sequels , many imitators , and an upcoming `` re-imagining '' . it 's very quotable - who could ever forget dr. loomis ' ( pleasence ) speech in which he describes michael myers to the sheriff ( charles cyphers , a reliable repertory player in several of carpenter 's earlier works ) ? it 's fantastic , and worth seeking out . this is my favorite john carpenter movie of all time . it 's not totally infallible - there are script holes , after all - but overall it makes a solid impact . 9/10
the animation was fab and the film funny . the two circus bugs , tuck/roll were very funny . if you waited till the credits at the end , you saw a very funny sequence of film , where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies , that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable .
if you like adult comedy cartoons , like south park , then this is nearly a similar format about the small adventures of three teenage girls at bromwell high . keisha , natella and latrina have given exploding sweets and behaved like bitches , i think keisha is a good leader . there are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school . there 's the idiotic principal , mr. bip , the nervous maths teacher and many others . the cast is also fantastic , lenny henry 's gina yashere , eastenders chrissie watts , tracy-ann oberman , smack the pony 's doon mackichan , dead ringers ' mark perry and blunder 's nina conti . i did n't know this came from canada , but it is very good . very good !
this was different , that 's for sure . just look at the cast ! talk about oddballs . william h. macy and ben stiller were the stars , although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight , in this farce about superhero-wannabees . the most outrageous was played by paul reubens of `` pee wee herman '' fame . there is lots of humor , garish colors and no lulls . it 's a pretty entertaining , lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters , all of whom want to be heroes a la superman , batman , spiderman , you name . they have talents in strange areas , however , that the real heroes do n't ( and do n't want to ! ) . it 's silly , but you know that going on . it 's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity . it 's a long movie for one so hectic , so taking a break here and there is okay . the language was tame so kids could enjoy this , too . in fact , i do n't recall any swearing in here , except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering , `` what a dumb , f -- -ing movie . '' i thought it was fun two hours but i 'd rather watch it on dvd and take a few breaks .
okay , okay , maybe not the greatest . i mean , the exorcist and psycho and a few others are hard to pass up , but the shining is way up there . it is , however , by far the best stephen king story that has been made into a movie . it 's better than the stand , better than pet sematary ( if not quite as scary ) , better than cujo , better than the green mile , better the dolores claiborne , better than stand by me ( just barely , though ) , and yes , it 's better than the shawshank redemption ( shut up , it 's better ) , i do n't care what the imdb top 250 says . i read that , a couple of decades ago , stanley kubrick was sorting through novels at his home trying to find one that might make a good movie , and from the other room , his wife would hear a pounding noise every half hour or so as he threw books against the wall in frustration . finally , she did n't hear any noise for almost two hours , and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something ( i tell this with all due respect , of course ) , she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand , and the book was the shining . and thank god , too , because he went on to convert that book into one of the best horror films ever . stephen king can be thanked for the complexity of the story , about a man who takes his wife and son up to a remote hotel to oversee it during the extremely isolated winter as he works on his writing . jack nicholson can be thanked for his dead-on performance as jack torrance ( how many movies has jack been in where he plays a character named jack ? ) , as well as his flawless delivery of several now-famous lines ( ` heeeeeere 's johnny ! ! ' ) . shelley duvall can be thanked for giving a performance that allows the audience to relate to jack 's desires to kill her . stanley kubrick can be thanked for giving this excellent story his very recognizable touch , and whoever the casting director was can be thanked for scrounging up the creepiest twins on the planet to play the part of the murdered girls . one of the most significant aspects of this movie , necessary for the story as a whole to have its most significant effect , is the isolation , and it 's presents flawlessly . the film starts off with a lengthy scene following jack as he drives up to the old hotel for his interview for the job of the caretaker for the winter . this is soon followed by the same thing following jack and his family as they drive up the windy mountain road to the hotel . this time the scene is intermixed with shots of jack , wendy , and danny talking in the car , in which kubrick managed to sneak in a quick suggestion about the evils of tv , as wendy voices her concern about talking about cannibalism in front of danny , who says that it 's okay because he 's already seen it on tv ( ` see ? it 's okay , he saw it on the television. ' ) . the hotel itself is the perfect setting for a story like this to take place , and it 's bloody past is made much more frightening by the huge , echoing rooms and the long hallways . these rooms with their echoes constantly emphasize the emptiness of the hotel , but it is the hallways that really created most of the scariness of this movie , and kubrick 's traditional tracking shots give the hallways a creepy three-dimensional feel . early in the film , there is a famous tracking shot that follows danny in a large circle as he rides around the halls on his big wheel ( is that what those are called ? ) , and his relative speed ( as well as the clunking made by the wheels as he goes back and forth from the hardwood floors to the throw rugs ) gives the feeling of not knowing what is around the corner . and being a stephen king story , you expect something to jump out at you . i think that the best scene in the halls ( as well as one of the scariest in the film ) is when danny is playing on the floor , and a ball rolls slowly up to him . he looks up and sees the long empty hallway , and because the ball is something of a child 's toy , you expect that it must have been those horrendously creepy twins that rolled it to him . anyway , you get the point . the shining is a damn scary movie . besides having the rare quality of being a horror film that does n't suck , the shining has a very in depth story that really keeps you guessing and leaves you with a feeling that there was something that you missed . had jack always been there , like mr. grady told him in the men 's room ? was he really at that ball in 1921 , or is that just someone who looks exactly like him ? if he has always been the caretaker , as mr. grady also said , does that mean that it was him that went crazy and killed his wife and twin daughters , and not mr. grady , after all ? it 's one thing for a film to leave loose ends that should have been tied , that 's just mediocre filmmaking . for example , the amityville horror , which obviously copied much of the shining as far as its subject matter , did this . but it is entirely different when a film is presented in a way that really makes you think ( as mostly all of kubrick 's movies are ) . one more thing that we can all thank stanley kubrick for , and we should thank him for , is for not throwing this book against the wall . that one toss would have been cinematic tragedy .
the one and only season has just aired here in australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant ! i love it ! all the story lines are so good ! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today . yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other . their problems were real , and it really drew you into the show . the show is basically about this family called 'the days ' and their lives . the family consisted of abby day ( mum ) , jack day ( dad ) , natalie day ( sporty daughter ) , cooper day ( outsider son ) , and nathan day ( boy genius son ) . each episodes a day of their life , with coopers perspective on things throughout it . i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great . he was by far my favorite character . it ended with so many things it could 've continued with , i 'm really sad another season was n't made . it was a great show i 'm gon na miss it .
a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between . as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film . also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original . i 'm tired of the same old stuff in movies . a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between . as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film . also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original . i 'm tired of the same old stuff in movies . a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between . as a child of divorced parents i was totally relating to events in the film . also - a really cool zombie twist which i thought was very original . i 'm tired of the same old stuff in movies .
i found this movie hilarious . the spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest i have seen in this sort of movie . give it a try . if you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing , and you get the humor , you should enjoy the movie . i ( and the others who watched the movie with me ) felt the funniest part in the movie ( this is not a spoiler because i will not tell you what actually happens ) was a scene with the `` flashy thingy '' from mib . when they first discover the device and do not know what it is does ... and then again later in the movie ... you 'll understand when you get there . my only complaint about the movie is that i have never been able to find it in dvd so that i could buy a copy .
plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie , but `` follow the fleet '' 's screenplay is exceptionally mediocre . fred and ginger still come off all right -- they play `` bake '' baker and sherry martin , dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy . when they meet again , their love-hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments . but for much of the movie , they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry 's sister connie ( harriet hilliard ) , her love for sailor bilge smith ( randolph scott ) , bilge 's dalliance with another woman , and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father . though hilliard is rather charming , this plot is uninteresting . but at the same time , `` follow the fleet '' is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents . astaire gets two good solos with `` we saw the sea '' and `` i 'd rather lead a band . '' he sings expressively and , of course , dances electrifyingly -- and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual . rogers sings the catchy `` let yourself go '' and later does a solo tap-dance to the same tune . the three duets really save the film , even though they 're all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses . fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of `` let yourself go '' . later , they sing and dance `` i 'm putting all my eggs in one basket '' as if it were an early rehearsal of the number , flubbing the choreography to comic effect . at the end , the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet -- it makes it part of a show-within-the-show . the situation is contrived , but the song , `` let 's face the music and dance '' , is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote ( it 's reminiscent of cole porter ) , and the dancing matches it in elegance . quintessential astaire and rogers . it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of `` follow the fleet '' again , and , in fact , it 's not necessary , because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers . but i could watch the songs over and over .
i tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now i 've seen the film ! ! what a ride ! and what a trip to finally get to know darius weems ! such a courageous , wise , funny and talented spirit ! and what a crew ! to listen to darius laughing from being in the water at panama city , to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in louisiana , the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon , the excitement of rafting through some rapids , the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi , and the phone calls home , and as always - boys will be boys . this film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike . darius and his mother are models of strength and courage . and the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation . they got darius a new wheelchair ; they documented accessibility problems ; they took darius on the trip of his life ; and they touched many , many lives . by raising awareness of dmd and encouraging funding for research , this film will help accomplish the final goal of darius goes west - a cure for dmd .
i saw this movie a million years ( 5 years to be exact ) ago for the first the time . in the light of recent events with the australian woman schapelle corby being imprisoned in indonesia for so called smuggling pot , i decided to watch this movie again . i excepted to cry my heart out , 'cause i 'm sucker for hot girls in need ( just read my review of 'the stalking of laurie show ' ) . some moist escaped my eyes , but it were hardly buckets filled with tears . why ? not because the two heroines were n't utterly adoring and helpless , not because the movie was n't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions . why then ? why did i not cry ? i wanted to cry ! when i rent a movie like this , i except to be moved , to sob like there 's no tomorrow , to feel miserable and like it . this movie was simply too short to do this . it was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements , and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside . clare danes and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends , but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing ( and oppressing ) surroundings . the mental journey is missing here for some reason . you only get to see the key moments of it ( which are very touching , i admit ) , probably because of bad editing . sometimes i felt these girls were walking around in a postcard . the relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention . what 's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents ( especially between alice and her dad ) ? you catch a glimpse of it , but the film does n't quite offer the whole picture , sadly enough . nonetheless this was a great movie , and at the end i even had to bite my lip a bit . but i guess this has more to do with the acting skills ( and the looks ) of the actresses ( and the music ) then with the merit of the director . to be honest , i hardly knew who kate beckinsale was before i watched this movie ( again ) . now , i am a fan ! great movie , as long as you do n't expect it to be classic cinema .
... would probably be the best word to describe this film ( in my opinion ) . besides one great heck of a fan service for fan girls ( well , that was redundant~ ) , it was the story that blew me away . hurray for takahisa zeze and gackt ! and i know some people will disagree with me on this one , but it was n't any of the big three actors ( the guys that played sho , son , and kei ) that gave the best performance ( for me , anyway ) . it was taro yamamoto , boy # 5 from battle royale ! do n't get me wrong , i like hyde , i worship his voice , but the problem was that some of his scenes came a little bit 'off ' , but i loved that scene where he danced with the dead guy 's body killing the other guys . and gackt was n't at all that bad too , i preferred how his character was kind of aloof from the start . nothing much i can say about my background on lee-hom wang , i wo n't pretend to know him , but he carried his own weight with the star-studded cast . this movie paved the way for one of the best collaborations i 've ever heard , orenji no taiyou ( forgive my spelling if it 's wrong ) . while the complete song lasts about nine minutes , you would n't notice the length because you 'd be enjoying hearing gackt and hyde together . anyway , this movie is a must-see not only for the fans ( huge fan base~ ) but for those who enjoy sci-fi , futuristic movies , asian-style .
in another one of bugs bunny 's hare-raisingly wacky shorts , the famous leporid * works in a department store display case , when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him . of course , this proves nearly impossible , as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve ( and knows when to cross-dress ) . as always , they keep everything coming at top speed , and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted ! among other things , `` hare conditioned '' is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the '40s before the termite terrace crowd polished them . but do n't get me wrong , the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived . anyway , this is a great one . * leporids are rabbits and hares .
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young , it had everything that was great with 90 's kids movies ... lovable dinosaurs , cute kids , an eccentric villain , and a few great songs ( and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs , but ones that are atually entertaining ) ! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever ! i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie , and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations ! sorry not the most informative , i 'm in kinda a rush ... just please , trust me . all who go against this movie are killing their inner child !
halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child . he takes out his problems on his older sister , whom he murders at the beginning of the film . this is just the start of things to come from michael myers . donald pleasance plays the doctor who 's been studying myers for years . he knows that something is different about him , something mysteriously evil . this evil will not be contained , and it can not be stopped . after an escape from an institution , myers tracks down his younger sister . if he kills her , there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy . but he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way . he manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs . there have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer . but this one started it all , sort of . if you think about it , most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have freddy kruger or jason chasing around half naked girls . well , if it was n't for halloween , those characters would n't have haunted our dreams when we were children . halloween 's director , john carpenter , got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s . this films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of jamie lee curtis , who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer . this film may seem cliché today , but back then there was n't much out there like this . it 's been copied from and ripped off of , but halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie . it still gives you chills listening to carpenter 's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy michael myers .
i had nowhere to go . i was on a flight to vancouver . i would probably have missed this film if i had n't chosen air canada . watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front , i found this captivating and mesmerising . i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to it 's end . now i 'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i 'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door , is yet to be discovered ! the photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills out ' the story the photographs tell . recommended ( if you have time on your hands ) .
we so often talk of cinema landmarks - kane , the godfather , a bout de souffle . one film however is too often overlooked by `` serious '' film critics . i am talking of course about the classic doc savage ( m.o.b . ) this film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism . not to mention kung-fu . it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history ( until of course queen 's breathtaking work on flash gordon ) . although a bit of a rarity , this film is well worth seeking out - it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold .
though the story is essentially routine , and the `` surprise '' ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience , you can see what attracted these good actors to the project - it offers them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine , and shine they do . the film is impeccably made - for its time . it was remade in 2000 as `` under suspicion '' and if you only want to see one version of the story ( that 's all it deserves , really ) , i recommend the latter one , with hopkins ' up-to-date direction and the more explicit references to plot points that the original could only hint at . the ending , however , still blows . ( * * 1/2 )
i really enjoyed this movie . i am a single dad with a 17 year old daughter who is smart , athletic and talented . i wish my girl applied herself so well to solving crimes and helping others ! so for me , perhaps this is pg level fantasyland . i read many nancy drew books in my teen years , long , long ago . sure this character was ably played by emma roberts but did not resemble the nancy drew i recall from the books . that is due to script , not the acting . emma is an adorable teen , playing a self-confident , industrious and proud character with good manners and good taste . she is not caught up in the trendy competitiveness around her . there are some weaknesses in the plot , aside from not resembling the nancy drew of the books , and trying to figure out what decade we 're in . ( like , what is that car , anyway ? ) i read the imdb overview before seeing the film , as i was researching rachael leigh cook from other movies . this is not one of her best roles , but i will continue looking for more of her films . rachael was too old to play this lead , but does a fine job as the grown-up orphan central to the mystery . i am very disappointed in other reviews written here . some expect perfect connection with the books , some expect more credible situations or adult action film . i got what i expected ! good entertainment well targeted to young teen girls , and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of conduct and achievement . this is a teen pg movie , not james bond ! which would you want for a role model for your teenaged daughter ?
partially from the perceived need , one feels , to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950 's movie-going public . the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper-class bureaucrats running the foreign office -- - the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves . but after that , the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot . terry-thomas watchable as always , but the great talent in the cast ( peter sellers , et al ) is largely wasted . a diverting , but not great film .
there are moments in the film that are so dreadful , your teeth ache . but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies innocuous and bland , paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and leering went out of style . vanities is so horrifically anti-female that it 's delicious . as kitty carlisle sings , women are displayed with price tags that would insult a bronx hooker . they emerge from clams ( nudge , nudge ; wink , wink ) in postures of absolute submission . minions of the law , so stupid they can not find the door , get to look up their skirts and snicker . bare-breasted chorus girls sit uncomfortably in giant cacti ( could they be a source of hallucinogens , perhaps ? ) while we listen to `` sweet marijuana '' and watch as blood falls on a chorines 's breast . sure , carl brisson learned his lines phonetically and does n't seem to have a clue what he is saying . but it 's all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking . taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise . watch this with a charter member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood machismo sch tick between body blows . toby wing , by the way , is the icing on the cake . and duke ellington does n't hurt either . a must stroll down memory lane .
this is a script that ed wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made . aris iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other , more transitory valuables . this is a dialogue-free movie , that some may foolishly describe as silent . in fact , it is a quite noisy film , without the inane chatter of most flicks . in the hands of these filmmakers , the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the hollywood script mill , particularly that stupid boat movie billy zane last was in ( 'watch out ! ' , 'oh no ! ' - j. cameron .... ick ... ) i 'll take zane 's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day . billy zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film . ricci is radiant as always , and the gods are shining when you can put sandra bernhard , rick ( y ) schroeder , eartha kitt and andrew mccarthy 's name on the same poster . the design is perfect , the pyramid set exquisite , and ron perlman 's beastly performance is simply wonderful . overall , this is a chaotic , visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of ed wood jr. , auteur and cinenephile . a must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate iliopulos and his cast obviously do . a film to make you wish you had made it yourself .
this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization . in reality , perhaps they are . after all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne . matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him . there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real . there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less hollywood than many pictures . these sequences add realism to the film in feeling . the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off . this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series .
after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making . the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project . it would be great to see a contemporary documentarian ( ken burns ? ) take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone . with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since 1974 when the world at war was produced , an updated version of this series would be welcome . the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original . if you are interested in this era do n't miss this series . it is required viewing .
very nice action with an interwoven story which actually does n't suck . interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts . having jenna jameson and asia carrere helps liven it up , too . jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding ! worth picking up just to see her !
what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band . this disc is not for the faint of heart ... the music is incredibly intense , and very cool . what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long . it is true that their records were great , but their shows were the top of the heap . in 1969 when this concert was shot , the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands ( and audiences ) had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuosity -- something that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina . what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise . try the concert out , it really is amazing .
to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it did n't go into theaters , the deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when used , there are a few dull moments when the story 's following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday get 's the props it should.the very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writer , the property he buy 's turns out to be where the witch ( tooth fairy ) lives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger do n't wan na give anything really away just a little info if you 've wanted to see this movie then do so it 's worth the price of the rental
probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life , and i enjoyed it . the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i.e . mozambique , angola , and guinea ( bissau ) - cape vert . most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of caetano 's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including spinola , who took over as the new president . the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .
in this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies . this is amusing at first , but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances , how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable . characters often interact in a peculiar way , with no tact or manners or respect . i believe this is intentional , not bad acting . after all , who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city 's inhabitants behave like that . i did n't like most of the action scenes , apart the death of the priest : too cheap even for the seventies . the plot is n't too polished . but the great scenes and ideas - like the death of sol , the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with , the `` furniture '' - outweigh the shortcomings of this film . 8 out of 10 .
i watched the un-aired episodes online and i was so sad that the show wo n't be back . it had the best cast of mature , talented actors and an amazing chemistry . it seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life . towards the end the show became engaging , sexy and highly watchable . of course , some of the story lines are not realistic , so what ... the characters are all likable and you root for them . the show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites : `` sex and the city '' and `` felicity '' . big kudos to all the cast . note to abc execs : nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results . the show audience will mostly record it . i 've been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with reality-tv or teenage oriented shows . why to get a mature , thoughtful , well-acted material we have to switch to hbo or fx ? i can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online . the new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers .
to all the haters out there : condemning a tv series with one episode is like judging an entire book after reading the first few pages . that being said , i was a huge fan of bsg , thought it was some of the best tv drama ( not just sci-fi ) on the air . but it was time for it to end and the story to move on . i liked the bsg epilogue `` the plan '' , but it raised as many new questions as it answered , so i eagerly anticipated `` caprica '' and i was not disappointed . i was hoping it would not try to be another bsg , and i was pleased that `` caprica '' is something different , and i personally found the story exciting , in a different way than blazing space battles , explosions and sci-fi special effects ( do n't get me wrong , i like that stuff too ) . eric stolz and esai morales give solid performances , and alessandra was just wonderful . i ca n't wait until next week .
i have seen this movie many many times and i will never get tired of it . it is a classic in every sense of the word . the movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time . for those of you who are not a fan of `` subtitles '' or of foreign film in general , open your mind . this is a great movie for `` the beginner '' because the story is so entertaining . do n't get me wrong , it is 100 % japanese ( and that is what makes it work ) , but everyone will get something out of it ( even if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called mr. aoki - one of the funniest characters i have ever seen ! ) i ca n't even think of this movie without smiling ! ! i love it ... and i think most people will too .
a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth . ( things must be pretty bad back on mars . ) two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash . whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy 's pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner . the diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning . now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge . the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus , although he did n't notice who they were . the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed . one of them is an alien , but which one ? all of them are suspect . there 's the crazy old man ( jack elam ) , of course , who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit . there 's a blustering businessman who must get to boston ( john hoyt ) . a young couple on their honeymoon . ( execrable performance by the husband , ron kipling . ) except for the couples , nobody has noticed anyone else . and even the couples are suspicious of each other . bride to newly minted husband : `` i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin . '' the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason , the lights go on and off , the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously . it 's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle . there is no discernible `` depth '' to it . it 's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens . it 's not a warning of any kind , just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses . i always enjoy it when it 's on . it 's especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman , knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm 's version of shakespeare 's play . and here he is -- with three arms . oops .
of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film . from that point of view it is utter fantasy . but who cares ? it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane , battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching . films like this are worth a hundred citizen kanes.it is about what cinema does best : great camera-work , great settings and great performances . the three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented , keeping the best till last . i will gladly watch this film again and again and again and ...
i was around 7 when i saw this movie first . it was n't so special then , but a few years later i saw it again and that time it made fun , a lot : ) i think the best parts of the film are : yeti 's body language and the 'special effects ' also . if you wan na watch this movie , do n't wait for a hollywood made blockbuster , even this film was made from approx . 1000 dollars : ) i 've a copy of it.movie and video version as well ( but i do n't think it had been ever shown in cinemas ) watch it , enjoy it ! ! ! yeti for ever ! ! !
ms patty duke 's story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles . i saw myself acting out just like her . i was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children . i saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and i have loved this movie so much . anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie . never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for . that is not the issue here . the issue is how ms duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame . ms. duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope . unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they do n't know the hell they have to live with . the movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts . it was so real ... so , so , real . it was like watching myself up there on screen . i wish i could thank ms. patty duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness . bocka
of course , by any normal standard of film criticism , soldier is a very poor film indeed . kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the crash mats . abandoned on a junk planet , he 's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening , family life and , um , breasts . kurt does n't talk much . finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they 're running away . kurt gets angry and kills everyone . a planet gets totalled . the end . unless the academy start a new category for `` best explosion '' , soldier is not going to win any awards . however , as ludicrous as it is , it remains an enjoyable experience . the military hardware is the coolest since aliens ( the apc 's especially ) and , at 90 minutes long , it does n't outstay its welcome . please note that the below mark is only a guide . knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you do n't like miniguns . 7 out of 10
endearing tale ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not all that much comedy ( compared to a i almost wet myself movie ) although funny enough . not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me , but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important . maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally ? ahab no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie . really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling , reminding you of what romance could and should be like , something to shoot for . my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
they had me from the first show . welcome to trinity county . a sleepy little mayberry-like place with one slight difference . the sheriff is really satan . there 's the spoiler . not like you would n't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway . oh , but that 's not all . it turns out that satan has a son named caleb . some people are trying to keep him good , but it 's an uphill battle . sheriff buck ( satan ) knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness . subtle . sneaky . he does n't always come off as evil . most of the time he 's a hero . everyone owes him a big favor , because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it . so every time you think someone will finally take him down , one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it . in one of my favorite episodes , lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them . lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil . the robber ( ted ) was hesitant to shoot them . lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience . if he had no conscience , he would have shot them by now . if he had a real conscience , he never would have become a criminal . so he started calling him half-ted . it was pretty funny . he was taunting the criminals . and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-ted at all times . and of course he was in complete control at all times . they actually had you favoring satan . very very excellent show . it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time . twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural that 's good company .
`` the notorious bettie page '' ( 2005 ) directed by : mary harron starring : gretchen mol , chris bauer , lili taylor , sarah paulson , & david strathairn mpaa rating : `` r '' ( for nudity , sexual content and some language ) it seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life . from ray charles to johnny cash , biopics are very posh right now . `` the notorious bettie page '' is the latest of these to be released on dvd . it features gretchen mol as the world 's most famous pin-up model , bettie page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color . unlike `` ray '' , `` walk the line '' , and `` finding neverland '' , however , this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the oscars this year . this movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in bettie page 's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested . this does not mean , however , that it is a bad movie . in fact , `` the notorious bettie page '' is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie -- a solid work of cinema . this film focuses more on page 's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography . it is filmed with fervor and care and mary harron 's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about . everyone knows bettie page ( played by mol ) . whether you know her as an icon or a simple porn star you know her . she is a woman who had a very profound impact on american culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time . now , most people know her as one of america 's first sex symbols -- a legend to many models , especially those of playboy and other adult-oriented magazines . she lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and page 's bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the american public into an uproar . in fact , the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn . the performances in `` the notorious bettie page '' are absolutely wonderful with gretchen mol standing out . her performance as bettie page is simply brilliant . i understand that , when she was announced for the role , many people were skeptical . her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when i think of great performances . now , it will . she completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance . david strathairn is fresh off of last year 's `` good night , and good luck '' , in which he gave one of 2005 's best performances . here , he gives yet another fine performance even though he is slightly underused . i was shocked at how very limited his screen time was but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie . the only performance i have seen from lili taylor was that in `` the haunting '' ( 1999 ) . while most people ignored the movie , i found it to be an enjoyable , if not completely shallow , horror movie and i also have always thought that taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught nell . here , taylor gives yet another credible performance . she gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of gretchen mol . after everything was said and done , i realized that `` the notorious bettie page '' can not be compared to other biopics , such as `` finding neverland '' and `` walk the line '' . it is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career , from the beginning to the end . her personal life is briefly implied , but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point . we watch the film knowing that page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will have but we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life . she is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself . after all , she was an adult model turned christian missionary . this movie does not over dramatize anything . it could have included fictitious moments of page sobbing hysterically and begging god to forgive her . it could have shown page running and screaming through the rain , trying to escape the ghosts of her past and yet it does not . `` the notorious bettie page '' tells a simple story and that is something rare by today 's standards . fortunately , it is quite refreshing . final thought : `` the notorious bettie page '' is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography . overall rating : 9/10 ( a )
this sci-fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 . visually it is a wonder to behold , but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and progress.this gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times.raymond massey and cedric hardwicke , both great actors , come off as quite a pair of fanatics . ralph richardson is very good as the `` the boss '' a megalomaniac warlord . the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time . i 'm sure glad that war did n't turn out as it did in the movie . there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie 's different episodes . although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be , this movie sticks in your mind long after you 've seen it .
when i was six yo , i learned about a series called `` los campeones '' , and even if i was just a kid i did everything i need to convince my parents to let me watch `` the champions '' and `` the avengers '' once every week . i think that was the golden age of english series ... ( i already own the complete cycle of `` the prisoner '' ! ) but lasted also a few years later with `` the tomorrow people '' , `` the worst witch '' ( i just me , or this is `` harry potter '' in girl , of course , before as much as i want `` the campions '' to be in zone 1 or zone 4 , i 'm also waiting for `` dr. who '' ( pack the whole series in a set of , uhm , maybe 300 dvd 's , please , i could n't expend more for it , 8 ) , `` people of tomorrow '' , and several other 'low budget ' , but great stories to be available within my reached zones . i speak and understand english , but not all my relatives do , including my parents , whom introduced me into these great stories ... i hope someday , someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as i originally view them ... dubbed or subtitled , but in the same format i saw them . remember , zone 1 or 4 are ok with my tv set !
well , this might be one of the funniest movies of all time , and sandy gives a tour-de-force performance ! alas , her career never quite took off , but - at last - she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures : `` the king of comedy '' , `` dallas doll '' , and `` without you i 'm nothing '' . she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america . sexy and fierce , tender and sensual , philosophical and melancholic , she convinces the audience in every scene , and she actually is `` really pretty '' . watch this one ( if you 're not from iowa ) , you 'll certainly enjoy it ! !
i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill , jackie kennedy 's sister and the cousin of these women , would encourage the maysles ' to make `` big edie '' and `` little edie '' the subject of a film . they certainly could be considered the `` skeletons '' in the family closet . the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women . i 'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating . ( i.e . `` are they nuts ? or am i missing something ? '' ) . this movie is hard to come by . netflix does not have it . facets does , though .
the movie starts something like a less hyper-kinetic , more pastiche dead or alive : strange underground activities are done while bodies are discovered by police officers . but when a police officer is killed , one tatsuhito gets involved ... and when he discovers that his brother shihito is also involved , things get bloody quite fast . an earlier work of miike 's , shinjuku triad society is still filled with his usual in the ol ' ultraviolence and sadistic sex acts , though it 's not one of his more eclectic or flamboyant pieces . rather , it 's a pretty well crafted bit of pulp fiction , as tatsuhito digs his way through the underground , a maze that leads him to a gay triad leader who sells illegally gained body organs from taiwan and keeps an almost-brothel of young boys ( one in particular the character who kills the cop at the beginning ) . tatsuhito 's brother is getting involved with said society , so tatsuhito himself is forced to become a dirty cop and use similarly violent and sadistic tactics to penetrate into this sordid realm . what 's mainly interesting about this little bit of work is the relationship tatsuhito has with his nemesis , wang . tatsuhito is a japanese born in china , later moved back into japan , and alienated for it . wang is a chinese who felt alienated in china , so killed his father and developed a crime wing in japan . wang also is a surprisingly shakespearian character , which is weird enough as it is , much less that you actually begin to feel sorry for him by the time his ultimate showdown with tatsuhito comes to be . and tatsuhito himself is a similarly tragic figure when he 's forced to contend with his lack of ability to control his brother . while it would be rude to state that miike 's movies are successful mostly on their shock value , it is true that sometimes it 's easy to lose track of how well miike can create bitter , dis-impassioned characters . -- polarisdib
this is one of those movies that , after watching it , you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing . the acting is spectacular for starring two children ( i usually hate movies with whiny kid acting ) . bill paxton is awesome , his directorial debut is even better than what i expected of an actor whose most memorable line is `` game over , man ! game over ! '' ( from the movie `` aliens '' ) . the best part about the movie is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play a family , and when they are doing their `` work . '' it really makes the movie believable and memorable . keep it up , bill . i 'll be waiting for more movies i '' m sure to love !
rented the movie as a joke . my friends and i had so much fun laughing at it that i went and found a used copy and bought it for myself . now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie i give them sasquatch hunters . it needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better . no talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are sasquatch repeated in a chant . i loved the credit at the end of the movie as well . `` thanks for the jeep , tom ! '' whoever tom is i say thank you because without your jeep the movie may not have been made . in short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at . if you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you do n't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy .
haunted by a secret , ben thomas ( will smith ) looks for redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does n't know . once his plan is set , nothing will be able to stop him . at least that 's what he thinks . but ben had n't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she 's the one who will end up transforming him . will smith is back again with director gabriele muccino , after the life inspiring movie `` the pursuit of happiness '' . `` seven pounds '' is yet another life changing movie experience , which not only does reminds you of their previous collaboration , tearful , but inspires you joyfully in the end . will smith , also is the producer again with some of the others . these movies are very realistic , which depicts a common man 's life & his struggles through life . seven pounds might have took some time to gain it 's actual momentum , but just after half an hour of the movie , the movie is all set to rule your heart . also , this movie has some twists revolving around , which lets the viewers keep guessing . director gabriele muccino once again is the winner all the way , with his emotional yet inspiring message . he makes all the characters of the movie very real , that the people would actually find themselves in somewhere of the movie . along with the director , will smith is yet another winner , with his superb acting skills . once again , the duo of the director & the actor works as a charm . also , there are other talented actors in the movie who did their part pretty well . rosario dawson , beauty with brains , that 's what she can be called . she looks beautiful & does her part extremely well . barry pepper , gives a great support to the movie & woody harrelson does the same , although woody did not had much screen timing ( would have been good if he had more ) . you wo n't forget this movie easily . watch this movie & change your life . top class cinema !
i f you thought sam mendes ' first film , the much heralded american beauty was a movie with style to spare , wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort , the unrelentingly grim 30 's gangster melodrama road to perdition . some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to the godfather , a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with mr. mendes ' extraordinary technical prowess . if the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great , then yes , road to perdition is a distant cousin to the godfather in terms of what it achieves in cinematography , editing , music scoring and sound . what it does n't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over . as with american beauty , there is a cold , distancing feel to this movie , despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love , loyalty and betrayal . this story of a hit man ( tom hanks ) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss , an elderly irish mob leader ( paul newman ) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past . the father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom . that being said , i have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies i have ever seen . veteran cameraman conrad hall will very likely win another oscar for his work here . the production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel . mr. mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color , and he and mr. hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks , blues and grays that dominate the movie 's color scheme . if i have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch , with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : daniel craig is the classic `` man you love to hate '' , the spoiled , impulsive son of newman 's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable jude law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film 's riveting second half . but acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here . if a rolls-royce was a movie , i 've no doubt it would look like road to perdition .
this movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded.this movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights , a very fit stallone putting in a good performance as well , an exciting plot , and a great performance from it 's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways.the movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play.the plot and story cries for this movie to make stallone an extra special human , much like the rambo or rocky or bond movie characters.they chose to humanise stallone 's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot 's style , weakens the excitement factor.also , the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times.the script should have been more realistic and less `` talky '' .another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.the movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses.they should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie.instead , they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences ( ala `` a-team '' tv series ) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops.this movie had a lot of all time great potential.crisper action sequences , better dialogue and more rambo/rocky style emotion/determination from stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level.i know this was not stallone 's fault.i sense the movie 's director wanted to tone down stallone 's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer.sill a good movie though ........
thanks to kevin smith , a bunch of geeks are running around saying that return of the jedi is n't any good because it 's actually fun to watch . and oh no ! muppets are involved ! that makes it bad ! everyone liked return of the jedi until someone in a kevin smith movie made a negative comment about it . now all of a sudden people people look at you like you have some kind of disease if you mention how much you like it . this movie is so much better than anything kevin smith ever even considered creating that it boggles my mind that the man would even think of denouncing it . this movie is good fun ! it 's just as awesome as i remember it being when i was six ! enjoy this movie for what it is and stop stealing kevin smith 's opinions ! his are n't correct ! and that ewok song at the end ruled ! i bet you people do n't even enjoy `` ewoks : battle for endor '' ! ! ! ! i 'm going to set you all on fire !
ice age is not only animation of the year ( in my eyes ) it 's also the best animated feature i 've ever seen ! the teaser excited me last year and i 've spent many happy hours on the website . scrat is cool ! and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes . the animation is superb . your heart really goes out to the characters in this film . they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed . it 's hard to say which one really steals the picture . i experienced their journey with laughter , tears and amazement . nothing was forced or over done . the emotion was genuine , especially in the dramatic second half . the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in 1997 , also a fox production . and before that it was the land before time 1988 . all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience , not just the cynics . 10/10
i first saw this film when i was about 13 . it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now . but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now . there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it . what we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side , beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow vision - on the other , two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil . this all makes for a great film story , but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate ' .
actually my vote is a 7.5 . anyway , the movie was good , it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it , do n't misunderstand me , is not the funniest movie of the world , and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies , but this one has its own taste , a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends ... i think that not exactly but who cares ? also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic , chris rock appears in it , the name is down to earth , men , that one its a very funny movie , see both if you want and i know that you will agree that mr. rock won with his movie . i would liked that the protagonist male character were given to ashton kutcher , however , the film is good .
surprisingly not terrible and well animated for one of disney 's straight to video throw away sequels . like the previous sequel ( the lion king 2 ) i was glad that disney brought back most of the original voice actors which makes a big difference and they kept a good level of traditional animation . the plot wanders around for a while but we are distracted by an unending string of jokes ranging from hilarious to dull . to break up the detached plot and jokes they gave us some silly musical sequences , which much like the jokes , range from entertaining to a quick trip to the fridge . for the most part the mst3k-like moments are bland and full of untapped potential and really do n't add a whole lot to the movie other than to act as a vehicle for an hour-long flashback . the new characters are at least likable , and the old characters are out doing their thing so i ca n't fault them there . overall this movie in not bad and it makes for a nice frivolous filler between the more serious lion king titles .
my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film . does it work ? yes . gee runs for mayor and gets shot . the homicide `` hall of fame '' turns up . pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series . a lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too . the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up . and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox . this is a good film .
i also viewed this film at the santa barbara film festival . it was an excellent film about adult family relationships . paul reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family . it was funny , warm , poignant , and moving , as well as entertaining . a film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews . i would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film . let 's only hope they 'll have the chance . i would rate this film as one of the best movies i 've seen in a year . it contains no violence , action scenes , murders , sex , so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up . believe me , there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value , instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given .
after realizing what is going on around us ... in the news .. in our homes .. the whole new world .. i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week ( in my town ) .. i started looking for this series .. 3 days ago .. didn ; t have luck till this moment .. and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs .. people , i believe they stopped the show because it 's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world ... it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying .. the people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now .. i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye ...
i got hooked on this as apparently abc has licensed this show to pearl tv in hong kong . it caught be my surprise , as it was a break from listening to anything chinese . but i started getting reeled in , as the cast and the story lines are just nyc enough and thoughtful . nothing too unbelievable , though i think it 's very very stereotypical of them to write damien as a potential black man with a sheet ! ! ! ! that has been the most disappointing aspect . the rest is great and i 'm sad to learn on imdb that i ca n't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the us . i 'm am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste . but just as shows that show characters getting closer , it 's probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in . which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks .
each of the major studios cranked out jazzy one-reelers throughout the thirties and forties ( with universal taking the lead ) . while most looked as cheap on screen as they were to make , warner bros. ( which abruptly stopped making them in 1946 ) often distinguished theirs with offbeat camera angles , mirrors and optical effects , thanks to some creative directors like jean negulesco . it is fitting that the best of this genre should come from this studio . what sets `` jammin ' the blues '' apart from the rest of the pack is that it more closely resembles an avant-garde experiment than a hollywood musical . filmed in july 1944 , it transforms an ordinary jam session into a `` trippy '' dream-escape from war-time troubles , highlighted by the tune of `` on the sunny side of the street '' . gjon mili and cameraman robert burkes ( later to work with hitchcock ) were allowed plenty of artistic freedom , perhaps because lester young was not glenn miller and the studio could care less how he and his fellow musicians were presented . the optical printer is put to good use , with multiple images of the same performer appearing at once . ( norman mclaren really milked this process two decades later in `` pas de deux '' , while linwood dunn 's team achieved different effects in `` citizen kane '' . ) the strong emphasis on silhouettes and lit cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time ; in some ways , this predated the psychedelic sixties , but with a distinctly forties film noir style .
i gave it a 10 , since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to . the reason i 'm troubling you is to add a personal observation on castle 's work . i 've seen `` homicidal '' and `` the tingler '' ( the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white ) a few times and `` the house on haunted hill '' many times . even i am not old enough to have seen them when castle was up to his showman tricks , thus i can appreciate them for their own merit . and while most pass him off as second-rate , schlocky , hammy , etc. , i believe they do him a disservice . the end sequence of `` homicidal '' is genuinely shocking and works today - and the premise of `` the tingler '' while silly , was highly original . but `` the house on haunted hill '' was a triumph . having used that frank lloyd wright house as its exterior , the great vincent price and a solid cast , plus a good score and production values - when i first saw it at a packed late-night showing in the late sixties , it produced an audience reaction i 'd not seen before and have not seen since . it was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement ( if you 've not seen the film , stop reading now ) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall . with no telegraphing of what is coming , the camera slowly pulls back , forcing the audience to switch their gaze to ... i 'm saying no more ( my `` spoiler '' declaration above only covers this movie ) . the point is , i believe this ploy was deliberate - not accidental - and when it happened , the whole audience screamed ( including most of the men ! ) it took the audience about ten minutes to calm down . now that is superior film-making . a flamboyant showman he might have been , but `` house '' and the other two films i 've mentioned were good movies . castle may not have been a hitchcock , but he was no ed wood , either . it 's easy to concentrate on someone 's quirks and forget to examine their talent . so i hope this documentary acknowledged that . i look forward to seeing it .
to suggest anton newcombe of the brian jonestown massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly . in dig ! which won the grand jury prize at sundance , we watch him and his band self-sabotage over seven years , while ex-friends and contemporaries the dandy warhols rise to comparative greatness ( a mobile phone advert , anyway ) . what elevates dig ! above its contemporaries is the immense , near-biblical comic-tragedy being played out : a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise . for all his `` look at me , i 'm a bloody genius '' posturing , newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted , if immensely troubled , musician - far more talented than his rival , the dandy 's courtney taylor who narrates the picture . if newcombe is dennis hopper , taylor 's peter fonda . even sadder , taylor appears to realise this , evinced by his weary , self-loathing voice-over : he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost ? in truth , they sold out , made indie-lite records , kept their teeth nice and clean , and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus . and jettisoning all credibility in the process . newcombe , on the other hand , lives in filth , is continually busted , beats up fellow band members on stage , kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in dig ! being ferried away by police , having lost the right to see his child . two of the best films about rock 's subculture have been directed by women : penelope spheeris 's the decline of western civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released .
steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful , original , raunchy breath of fresh air . i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was . basically the movie 's title says it all : andy stitzer is a 40 year- old male who works at an electronics store . he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics , and has the biggest collection . his peers that work in the store with him find out that he 's a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game , and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings , but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity , but he eventually gets lucky in the very end . leave the little ones at home , but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy . it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning , and by the time it is over , you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments . only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel was n't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago . he is definitely gon na win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards . you can bet your hard earned dollar on that , people ! i give this one a perfect 10 !
this documentary is incredibly thought-provoking , bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of aids . the past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments home . if this movie does n't make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people , you do n't have a heart .
it 's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos . even people that have seen the film ca n't get their mind off of that rape scene . it 's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction . it 's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie . people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene . the acting , plot , cinematography , and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it 's brooding charisma . the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter . the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them . the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires . not many films can make you feel this creeped out . bottom line : this movie is a classic . i ca n't really say much more than that .
this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way . dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives . laced with dreams - dripping in reality , the american dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the devil ray 's mid-life rookie , jimmy morris . australian born actress , rachel griffiths , plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know ; and dennis quaid was perfection cast as the wannabe , gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience . it 's real . the on-screen chemistry works . if you like baseball heart-warmers , you 're going to love this film . the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there . my popcorn became the a la mode ' . and hey : buy the cd ! the music rocks and carries the story magnificently ! syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should , an area that disappoints me more often than not . criticisms : i 'd have given the baseball to somebody else . but quaid has something to teach us all about character ' and heart . st. rita and the nuns were a nice decoration , but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them . a little long . worth every minute in the last analysis . 8 / 10 .
although the plot was a bit sappy at times , and very rushed at the end , as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story , overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre . however , the actress who played the babysitter , mariana klaveno , was very good ! i hope to see more of her around in movie-land . the music was also well done , getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh ( think `` jaws '' ) type music-based tension build-ups . i do n't think i 'd want to watch `` while the children sleep '' again , but if i did , it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno .
i absolutely loved this film ! i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it . i was completely enthralled through every second ! i found the story gripping , the acting intense , and the direction spot-on . i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie . even though there was nothing `` scary '' about the story itself , i was soundly on edge through the whole movie - and for the rest of my evening . i found that there were so many perfect choices made ... the casting , the script , the little bits of humor sprinkled in it . there were so many points where the film could 've gone for the cheap thrill , but it never did , and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately ... and for the last number of years .
i hope she can keep acting and directing . she 's surely up to the task and could easily develop that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare works of art . her work has a rare kind of generosity and her timing is spot-on ! oy i 'm kvell
finally a thriller which omits the car chases , explosions and other eye catching effects . the movie combines a simple plot ( assasination of a french president ) with an excellent background . it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities , and explains why we would obey almost every order ( even murder ) which would be given to us . furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled . the best thing on this movie is , that there is no classic `` hollywood end '' which can easily be predicted .
interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to . however , i 'll try . this was a very good action film with some great set pieces . you 'll note i specified the genre . i did n't snipe about the lack of characterisation , and i did n't berate the acting . enjoy if for what it is people , a well above average action film . i could go on but i 've made my comment .
there 's nothing really to dislike about `` the odd couple , '' and it 's no surprise that jack lemmon and walter matthau make a hugely winning comedic team . but there 's something so underdeveloped about neil simon 's adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied film . i have not seen the play , but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful , since simon wrote it , so the defects can not be blamed on a stage-to-screen adaptation . there are some interesting ideas in this story -- two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently -- that simon never fully fleshes out . still , there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours .
i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do . this film was void of all the video whore clichés , and it also skipped the gangsters , rappers , and foul language . it examined several relationships among physicians , african americans , and african american male/female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level . i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues . the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time . i saw it at the boston film festival as well . it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences . black people ( and everyone else ) would love a movie like this- if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there ! as an extra- if your a doctor , a resident , a medical student , a premedical student , married to a doctor , have a doctor sibling , have a doctor in the family , or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well . it portrayed residency and the practice in a true-to-life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors , residents , and medical students who viewed the film . dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is greatly apparent .
feroz abbas khan 's gandhi my father , a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the mahatma and his son harilal gandhi . for a story that 's as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell , it 's a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically . gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school . now the film aims to convey one very interesting point - the fact that gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person , ended up being an unfair father . this point is made in the film many times over , and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to england , which gandhi twice denies his son . instead of showing us how exactly harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head , the director just moves along with the story , thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment harilal feels towards his father . which is why when we finally see an outburst from harilal , it comes off looking like he 's over-reacting . the point i 'm trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why harilal became the rebel that he did . we never really understand why he turned to islam , and then back again to hinduism . the thing is , we never really understand harilal at all . and that 's because the director of this film is too busy focusing on mohandas karamchand gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle , a story most of us are already familiar with . to put it simply , gandhi my father promises to examine the strained father-son relationship , but it does n't so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in . we understand harilal had to live with the burden of being gandhi 's son , but show us why that was a burden to begin with . show us incidents of their early conflict . for example , it 's not enough that gandhi merely says he 's opposed to harilal 's early marriage , tell us why this opposition ? it 's not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out - for constantly shuttling him between schools in gujarat and south africa , for making him relocate every time gandhi needed to relocate . words are not enough , show us how these incidents shaped the character of harilal gandhi.what 's more , instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous gandhi versus gandhi relationship , the film goes off on too many tangents , thus diluting the impact of the central theme . this was never meant to be a film about the struggle for independence , and yet on many occasions that 's exactly what it seems like , because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment , even though much of it has no relevance to the film 's basic premise - the stormy father-son relationship . so you see the problem with this film is not that it 's a bad film , but it 's certainly a very confused film . what happens to harilal 's children after his wife 's death ? does he ever have relationship with them ? where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the mahatma and kasturba ? none of these questions are answered in a film that 's basically meant to be about relationships in the gandhi family . the film version of an immensely popular play directed by feroz abbas khan himself , gandhi my father is a disappointment , no questions asked.cinematically , it struggles to translate the filmmaker 's ambitious intention to the screen . practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fade-ins and fade-outs , never quite seamlessly leading into each other . on the positive side , there is inherent nobility in the film , which you recognise . the filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative , trying hard not to take sides , never once judging either father or son , painting neither as the villain . what the film does do , however , is make clear the fact that gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation , but evidently alienated his family . of all the actors in the film it 's only akshaye khanna who really shines in the role of the luck-deprived harilal gandhi . it 's a wonderful performance , and it 's not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character . but akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure . just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wife 's dead , and you 'll realise how much he conveys through body language alone . darshan jariwala , meanwhile , who plays gandhi senior , adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the mahatma in his later years , but it 's the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in south africa that is the actor 's best contribution to that role . the abundantly gifted shefali shah plays kasturba , the woman who 's meant to be torn in this father-son conflict , but if she 's unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then it 's really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script . much effort 's gone into the making of this film and that 's evident throughout , but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what you 'll remember about it when you leave the cinema - it 's just so boring.director feroz abbas khan 's gandhi my father is a sincere effort yes , but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay . what we learn from the film is that gandhi and harilal made each other very unhappy . and with this film , the director makes us too .
after you 've seen this small likable and comical film , you will for sure feel better . cheer to yves b. pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment , that according to me , will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the quebec . the actors isabelle blais , emmanuel bilodeau , sylvie moreau and stéphane gagnon all deliver a touching performance . i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'amélie poulain have given me . so if you 've like the jean-pierre jeunet magnificent film , i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b. pelletier , les aimants
the secret fury , in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama ( directed by mel ferrer ) boasts top-notch principals in colbert and ryan ; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end , when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre . but for some viewers the film 's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance -- the immortal ethel mertz on `` i love lucy . '' oddly , vance had very few film roles ; her true home was broadway , where ( among other gigs ) she understudied for ethel merman . here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme ; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she 's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel 's linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty .
i 'll be honest , i finally checked this movie not because of the stars -- though they were reasonably watchable and compelling , particularly the three leads -- or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service ( something , i 've been informed through the dvd extras of this show , has yet to ever happen.assuming that 's true , that 's remarkable ! ) . i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis ! ! well , okay , clark johnson , one of my faves from `` homicide : life on the street '' and a veteran ( mostly ) tv director . i 'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average , despite the possibilities . veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison ( michael douglass ) has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend , targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez . ( david rasche . anyone remember `` sledgehammer '' ? ) . his affair with the first lady ( kim basinger , clearly one of the hotter first ladies we 've ever had , fictional or real ) is certainly not helping his standing . he 's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief ( kiefer sutherland , almost still completely in `` 24 '' mode ) . throw in some other pivotal service agents ( martin donovan and the foxy , somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria ) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that does n't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired , if underwhelming , results . the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers . the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie , though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most ( myself included ) interested .
a laurel & hardy comedy short . the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle , a mad scientist who 's just perfected his rejuvenation serum . stan & ollie proceed with their dirty work , spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof . then the professor wants to try out his new potion ... a very funny little film . the ending is a bit abrupt , but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific . especially good is stan & ollie 's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney . that 's lucien littlefield as the professor .
actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray little richard than leon . he captures little richard to a most believable essence . the outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie . although the movie is a little long , it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of little richard in mind . the ending should have taken a direction of moving little richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium . he will always be the king of rock-n-roll as far as i am concerned regardless of what the other media says .
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war . the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused world war ii and hitler 's rise . every school child , nay , every american should watch these films today because they are so apropos . history has been repeating itself over and over again ! the lord chamberlains are still alive and kicking ; the tactics used by the nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the communists and now by muslim terrorist groups , are still working to these evil group 's advantage . by sitting back and letting hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive - france , america and england caused over 50 million people 's deaths . americans , french and british today would happily let hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties . these great films may be too simplistic for world war ii history buffs . they do n't tell the horrors that the soviet union caused simply because at the time america was teamed up with them , fighting hitler . this film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war .
well not actually . this movie is very entertaining though . went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the `` i think there might be something in my eye '' routine . the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance . jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides . in fact all the characters are great . the movie is not overly funny or sappy , good flick to go see with the wife . all in all 8/10 .... note * i am not an easy grader . thats all from bigv over and out !
back in the forties , when movies touched on matters not yet admissible in `` polite '' society , they resorted to codes which supposedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while alerting those in the know to just what was up . probably no film of the decade was so freighted with innuendo as the oddly obscure desert fury , set in a small gambling oasis called chuckawalla somewhere in the california desert . proprietress of the purple sage saloon and casino is the astonishing mary astor , in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder ; into town drives her handful-of-a-daughter , lizabeth scott , looking , in technicolor , like 20-million bucks . but listen to the dialogue between them , which suggests an older lesbian and her young , restless companion ( one can only wonder if a.i . bezzerides ' original script made this relationship explicit ) . even more blatant are john hodiak as a gangster and wendell corey as his insanely jealous torpedo . add burt lancaster as the town sheriff , stir , and sit back . both lancaster and ( surprisingly ) hodiak fall for scott . it seems , however , that hodiak not only has a past with astor , but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances . the desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil , with face-slappings aplenty and empurpled exchanges . do n't pass up this hothouse melodrama , chock full of creepily exotic blooms , if it comes your way ; it 's a remarkable movie .
in my opinion , this is a pretty good celebrity skit show . i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host . there are many reasons why i said that . even though hal sparks was an okay host , i sometimes wish that greg kinnear had n't left . if you ask me , it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore . still , i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities . if you ask me , that was pretty darn funny . before i wrap this up , i must say that i kind of miss this show . now , in conclusion , i highly recommend this show to all you die-hard sketch show fans . you will really enjoy it .
the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in . it is well made and very powerful . the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective . i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society . it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it . some parts were difficult to watch , as most reality is , but it is not over done . its good the first time you watch it , but it becomes even better the second or third time around ; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge .
the second official episode of the `` columbo '' series ( `` murder by the book , '' filmed later , hit the airwaves first ) . robert culp , who would match wits with peter falk 's detective in several future installments , is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a client 's wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes . the two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series .
the 700 club gives a great perspective on world events . some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy . i find the program to be informative and inspirational . it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful . there are very few shows that can point to a 40 year track record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them . while mr. robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated , i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism . i have certainly said some foolish things in my life . i would certainly be willing to forgive mr. robertson since he puts out a great show .
ok i 'll be honest , when i first saw the trailer for the programme , i thought it was an advert for some sun-screen product . with all the people walking around on the beach . despite this i decided to watch it , thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at . but i was seriously amazed . from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked , why is he lying in the trees , why did the plane crash etc etc . it 's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence , humour , action and suspense . but 'lost ' manages all of this . with a great cast and crew , beautiful locations , and pretty decent special effects , 'lost ' will catch anyone who tunes in , and is a must see for anyone who 's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv . lost is on tuesdays at 10 on channel 4 ( uk ) 4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 , 42 =o
i simply love this movie . i also love the ramones , so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place . there is n't a lot of critical praise to give this film , either you like it or you do n't . i think it 's a great cult movie .
clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the 4th movie of the dirty harry series . clint is older but he 's still got it , harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery ( where the memorable `` make my day '' catchphrase comes from ! ) but the city he took a vacation was worse , a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one . the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie ! an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious . clint eastwood 's sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator . worth a watch if you like clint eastwood , the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers .
this movie really is a mixed bag . on the one hand , the story and concept of the movie are really good , tense and have some nice plot twists in it . but than again on the other hand , it all is told very slow , without style and uninvolved . still i regard `` just cause '' as an above average thriller simply because of the fine cast . maybe sean connery was miscast in his role . i mean , he is n't really that believable as a the main 'hero ' and father of a young daughter ( played by a still very young scarlett johansson by the way ) and husband of kate capshaw . i feel that he simply was too old for the role to be really credible in it . however sean connerey is of course a great actor and that is the only reason why he is still able to carry the movie as good as he does . but he of course is helped by a very solid supporting cast that consists out of actors like laurence fishburne , blair underwood , ned beatty , hope lange , lynne thigpen and ed harris . all actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time , which is a real shame , as well as a missed opportunity . especially ed harris is just totally great in his role as a psychopathic serial killer . he 's truly chilling and acting superbly . normally he does n't play this ruthless , chilling sort of roles in movies , so he really surprises with his role in this one . his performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie . however due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formulaic , none of the characters in the movie really work out well because it feels all too distant . it really is the way of storytelling that kills all the movie its fine potential . arne glimcher directs the movie with little style and keeps the pace too low at times . because of this , we as viewers , never really get involved with the story or any of it 's characters . it really is too bad , for `` just cause '' had more than enough potential . a fine cast and a slick story with some unexpected twists and turns in it in which nothing is what it seems . the cast and story are the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller , that will probably still please the fan of the genre . it however is an eternal shame that the movie is lacking in its story telling and style , or else this movie could had been a real classic in its genre . 7/10
this movie , while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by mgm and starring janet leigh , is still a great film . danny glover in one of his best performances brings george knox , a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper , to life . as for this movie being `` stacked '' , how about adding christopher lloyd ( his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen , a wonderful actor ) , joseph gordon-levitt ( third rock from the sun ) , brenda fricker ( a charming and well seasoned irish actress ) , tony danza ( yes even he is good in this film ) , matthew mcconaughey ( he stole the show in dazed and confused , and his role may not be as pivotal in this film , but he got exposure ) , adrien brody ( what i said about matthew mcconaughey goes the same for adrien , except the dazed and confused part ) , some great character actors like taylor negron ( david ) , tony longo ( messmer ) , jay o. sanders ( ranch wilder ) , neal mcdonough ( whitt bass ) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances , ben johnson ( hank murphy , the owner of the california angels ) , and the rest of the cast does a great job , plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone , i do n't care what recesses of depression you 're in . i loved this film as a kid , and it brings back memories when i watch it today . i need this on dvd . i recommend it to any parent who 's looking for something their kids have not seen , and everybody else , for that matter .
at first this looked like a boring comedy like the odd couple , but when i got into it it turned out to be a really funny film . basically forgetful ex-comedians willy clark ( golden globe winner , and oscar and bafta nominated walter matthau ) and al lewis ( oscar winning , and golden glove nominated george burns ) were a great comedy duo , and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a tv show . willy 's nephew , ben clark ( golden globe winning richard benjamin ) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other , how wrong he is . they can not get on all the time , they are both forgetful , especially during conversation , but they do it eventually . also starring lee meredith as nurse in sketch ( miss mcintosh ) , carol deluise as mrs. doris green , al 's daughter , rosetta lenoire as odessa , willy 's nurse and muppets from space 's f. murray abraham as mechanic . i think the best line of the film is burns mentioning that matthau called him `` a son of a bitch bastard '' . it was nominated the oscars for best art direction-set decoration and best writing , screenplay adapted from other material , it was nominated the bafta for best screenplay , and it won the golden globe best motion picture - musical/comedy , and it was nominated for best screenplay . very good !
the film gets my stamp of approval . the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue . this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film . dickinson 's character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film . the best work angie dickinson did since point blank !
a top notch columbo from beginning to end . i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer , ruth gordon . as an avid columbo fan , i ca n't recall another one in which he does n't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes . in this one , as he 's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the `` message '' that the nephew left behind , it finally dawns on him . the music in this episode is very good as well , as it is in many of other ones .
this movie was excellent . it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the 80 's . i give this movie high marks for it 's no-holds-barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated ( thanks to the `` regime '' ) community . this is a graphic movie . it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it 's tragic remains . nothing is `` candy-coated '' with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen . this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo . i 'm familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film . it 's not a comedy , but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor , this movie is a must-see .
the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones . the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor , and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two . oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided , but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it . i suppose i was thinking more `` leisure suit larry '' risqué than the producers were ... definitely not a pg-13 movie , which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors , but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones . i liked it , but i doubt it will be a smash hit ... ( which is sad , as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to )
this is one of my all time favorites . if the movie has a flaw , it 's that it comes at you like a raging bull . it does n't so much engage the viewer as assault him . '' scarface '' is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself . nothing is left to the viewer 's imagination . moroder 's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee . like the chorus in a greek tragedy , it wails and gnashes , broods and tugs , a constant reminder of tony 's inexorable fate . not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress , `` scarface '' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train .
okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch . it 's about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac ( akshay kumar ) starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious . sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely . but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses . there 's garam masala at every step of the movie , songs rock but somethings lacking . the comedy 's not up to the mark and deserves an award . its nice but not all that excellent . some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it did n't deserve that many laughs . but of course everyone 's opinion is different . so if you wan na watch the movie you 're welcome to do so .
when i saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s , i was in awe of this film . visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in europe and usa made you relate with what antonioni was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie : blowing up in your mind the `` tyrannical '' establishments and big business interests . the repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert , the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water , painting a plane in psychedelic designs ( even the staid british airways did it a few years ago ) are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all over the world for decades . even pink floyd increased their fan following after the film was released . you see this film some 30 years later and you begin to wonder why the same film has lost its appeal . today anti-establishment films have more substance -- facts , documentation , fine performances , and superb screenplays . antonioni seems to be out-of-date ; a flawed genius . even viewing antonioni 's `` blow up '' today gives you the similar feeling that he is passe . `` zabriski point '' has to be evaluated for what it was when it was released . it was a great film if you were to see it on a wide panavision screen as opposed to the dwarfed tv screens . the visual and aural ( mick jagger , kieth richards , pink floyd , et al . ) allure of the film still remains . the lead pair were not great actors but they were cute and natural . one of them ( mark frechette ) died in prison in usa extending the reality of the non-conformist values he personified in the film . today , antonioni seems out of `` sync . '' but watch carefully and you will appreciate the muted sounds of the regular actors -- rod taylor , g.d. spradling , the ladies at the swimming pool , the cops at the air-strip . the real sounds in contrast are from the non-conformists . antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his grasp of the medium can not be questioned even today . he knew what he was doing .
i thought that this film was very well made , heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless . orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable . how true it is to what really happened i have no idea , but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do . maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged , so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought ? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film . all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it did n't do better in the cinemas .
this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies : bad porn movies without the hardcore sex . the plot in this one is n't so bad as these things go ; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife . the rest of the movie , however , leaves something to be desired . bad acting , bad direction , bad looking woman , bad sets , bad cinematography , bad sound and bad sex scenes . the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic . they do n't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene . how dumb is that ?
i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version ( which is brilliant ) . the 1985 was adapted by arthur hopcraft , who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year ( 2005 ) . i remember great acting , especially from rigg and elliott , and moving music . ( music in the 2005 version is far more understated , but very telling . ) just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points : richard carstone is ada claire 's boyfriend , not esther 's . esther had no uncle . charlie drake never played krook in either version , nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss ! krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version . toby was played by bernard hepton . both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens ' great novel . now read the book ! it 's not perfect , and the sentimentality may make you wince at times , but i defy you not to cry - and laugh !
24 has got to be the best spy/adventure series tv had ever aired . the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling . the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it . and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time . i rate this , along with the simpsons and the x-files , my three most favorite tv series . this first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate us senator david palmer who is also running for president . bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and , at the same time , figure his daughter 's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom . thus , begins an adventure on the best political style and , what 's best of it , is that it always takes place in real time , which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over .
this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based . the right to be presumed `` innocent until proven guilty '' is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society ; but according to fred schepisi 's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial , it was not granted to lindy chamberlain , accused of killing her baby . the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely ( a dingo was alleged to have taken it ) , but those implying her guilt even more so , and there was no solid evidence against her . but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt , and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media ( and the media themselves , of course , were anything but innocent in this process ) . so although cleared by an initial inquest , they were later prosecuted and convicted . although chamberlain was eventually released , this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence `` proving '' their innocence , something no defendants should have to produce . ' a cry in the dark ' is well acted throughout , especially by meryl streep , who puts on a convincing australian accent ( at least to this pom 's ears ) and manages keep lindy sympathetic ( to us ) while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure . the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking , because we believe in the characters as real . regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story ( something i ca n't comment on ) , the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership 's least charitable instincts . no legal system will ever be perfect ; but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away . i 'm not a religious man , but the bible still contains some killer lines ( if you 'll excuse the pun ) . `` judge not lest ye be judged '' is one of them .
i try to watch it everyday most of the time , and even though i have watched it for the past 4 years , i have not seen every episode . the show is about danny tanner who is guy who does news for sports . his wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks jesse , an elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair . joey , an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls , donna joe , they call her d.j. , stephinie who is the second oldest and michelle , the youngest . they all live under one roof with no one to help them out . later in the show , jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins , nicki and alex . ( this starts to happen in the new seasons ) this show is awesome , if you like the suite life of zack and cody , that 's so raven , boy meets world , and designing woman , you will love this . ( it starts to get better in the ending seasons ) watch it , you will love it !
apart from having the longest reign in british history ( 63 years ) , queen victoria also holds two other distinctions . she was , apart from our current queen , the oldest ever british monarch , living to the age of 81 . and she was also the youngest ever british ( as opposed to english or scottish ) monarch , coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen . and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her , they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl ; the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in `` mrs brown '' . `` the young victoria '' tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign . it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal , sarah duchess of york , whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra . there are three main strands to the plot . the first concerns the intrigues of victoria 's mother , the duchess of kent , a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter , largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy , who was widely rumoured to be her lover . ( according to one unfounded rumour he , and not the late duke of kent , was victoria 's natural father ) . the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert , and the attempts of king leopold of belgium , who was uncle to both of them , to influence this romance . ( leopold 's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of saxe-coburg , to which both he and albert belonged ) . the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history , the bedchamber crisis of 1839 , when supporters of the tory party ( which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy ) rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne , even though the whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government , with the monarch reduced to a figurehead . scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views , and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes , as he seems to lean to the side of the tories , the predecessors of the modern conservative party . their leader robert peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified , whereas melbourne , for all his dash and charm , is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform . there may be some truth is these characterisations , but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from william iv 's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration . lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies . prince albert , for example , was not injured in edward oxford 's attempt on victoria 's life , and melbourne ( in his late fifties at the time of victoria 's accession ) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany . king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent ( who was his sister-in-law ) , but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet , as he is shown doing here . i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a `` regency order '' ; the duchess 's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830 , which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession . no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act . there are also occasional infelicities . in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard , a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a `` danger ! major cliché ahead ! '' warning . yet in spite of scenes like this , i came to enjoy the film . there were some good performances , especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy . it is visually very attractive , being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama . jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william , although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top . ( although not as disastrously over the top as he was in `` moulin rouge '' ) . the main reason for the film 's success , however , is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert . blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life , but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination , the black-clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused , but a determined , strong-minded and loving young woman . her love for albert , and their happy family life together , was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people . ( with the exception of george iii , victoria 's hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues ) . blunt and friend make `` the young victoria '' a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history . 8/10
i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney ( whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit ) and his ocean 's 11 director steven soderbergh . worse , we picked this up in a discount bin for $ 4.99 ( canadian dollars at that ! ) what a grand and pleasant surprise . but then i 'm of the opinion that if william h. macy is in it you ca n't be disappointed . this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s . ok , with more profanity . this is an oddball and at times gut-splittingly funny film . the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying . perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history . maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast . best $ 5 i 've spent in ages .
dark angel is a futuristic sci-fi series , set in post-apocalyptic seattle , centering on max ( jessica alba ) , a genetically enhanced young woman , on the run from her creators . the dark angel universe is absorbing , ( not as much as say buffy , but absorbing nonetheless ) with an interesting and believable set of characters . certainly , it is not for everyone , but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there . dark angel is criminally overlooked , and under-rated , and was unfortunatly canceled after only 2 series . which was a great shame , as this had the potential to become a great series , although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of long running bbc sci-fi comedy red dwarf . as it is dark angel remains unfinished , so seek it out , and if you want more , lobby fox to make another series .
'moonstruck ' is a love story . there is not one romance , there are at least three , but they all have to do with the same family . loretta 's family . loretta ( cher ) is about to marry johnny cammareri ( danny aiello ) . she does n't love him , but he is sweet and good man . when he leaves to visit his dying mother in italy loretta meets johnny 's brother ronny ( nicolas cage ) . he and johnny have n't spoken each other in five years and loretta wants to invite him to the wedding . of course they fall instantly for each other . how this story and love stories of loretta 's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself . every seen is a delight to watch , with cher as the bright star in the middle of everything . she won and really deserved the oscar that year . cage is pretty good , and goofy as well , and olympia dukakis as loretta 's mother and vincent gardenia as her father are terrific . this movie is funny , charming and therefore highly enjoyable .
i really miss the production of good old fashion spooky films . if ismail merchant and james ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one , save for the lack of an internationally known , top drawer cast . this is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn , and you do n't even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers . bravo to director herbert wise , writers susan hill and nigel kneale , top production design by jon bunker , art direction by john ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though i 'm living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st century . i gave it a `` 9 '' out of `` 10 '' because with the production and budget constraints of television , they really pulled of a great show .
i was very impressed with this film . i would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns . i say that for the whole thing : the acting , mature dialog , no- nonsense story and excellent cinematography . director anthony mann , who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era , also made some westerns such as this one . it has that same film-noir look . mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period . . if you like this movie , i recommend the mann-stewart film `` bend of the river . '' in a nutshell , the story is about a man , `` lin mcadam , '' ( stewart ) who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle , a weapon he won fair-and-square in a contest . it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain . all of those villains are interesting characters . aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters , dan duryea , stephen mcnally , millard mitchell , charles drake , will greer and j. c. flippen . all of them are fun to watch . it was a bit of a stretch , however , to see rock hudson playing an indian ( `` young bull '' ) , but you ca n't have everything .
this is by far one of the better made movies and did n't leave me disappointed at all . the sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . the are always chances a movie wo n't hold ones beliefs as well as another , but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent . dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent . as for mr. washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light .
if you have n't already seen this movie of mary-kate and ashley 's , then all i can say is : `` what are you waiting for ! ? '' . this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much ! it 's fun , romantic , exciting and absolutely breath-taking ( scenery-wise ) ! of course ; as always , mary-kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway ! would any true fan want it any other way ? of course not ! anyway ; it 's a great movie in every sense of the word , so if you have n't already seen it then you just have to now ! i mean right now too ! so what are you waiting for ? i promise that you wo n't be disappointed ! sincerely , rick morris
i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv . it was on the sundance channel and was just starting . i love music , especially late 60s and this is what the bjm sounded like ( the dandys are alright ) . everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music , to anton and joel 's personalities , to the illicit drug use . it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch ( the look on their faces were priceless ) . anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all time . just watch it ... seriously
richard linklater 's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the 90 's best thinking person 's romantic movies . julie delpy turns in one of the decade 's most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train ethan hawke . the dialogue ( and there is oodles of it ) is sometimes meandering and overly precious , but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic , intellectual , and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing , touching and insightful moments .
one woman , by herself in a house for 45-minutes of screen time , does n't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat ... but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come ! writer / star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress , and enlarges them to terrifying proportions , so do n't watch this film alone !
when i was over at hollywood video i looked through their clearance out movies and there was demonicus for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off ! i saw it only once before and could n't pass up this great deal ! the second viewing was much better than the first . the box is so cool and the music is very good . if you have n't seen demonicus yet i recommend that you do or if you rented and hated demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind . if you seen a copy at hollywood video for the price i got it for do n't pass it up as it is a great deal ! demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it ! it has very low budget and actors i 'm sure that nobody is familiar with . we began the the video game uh i mean film with a guy and a woman some where in italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says do n't go in there and what does he do ? the normal stuff ! he did n't listen to her ! he goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named tyrannous ! where did the chair come from that tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the cauldron pot come from ? so every cave is complete with a caultron pot ? tyrannous is wearing his armor , helmet , and has a weapon or two.he does the dumbest thing a person could do , he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of tyrannous ! from there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real tyrannous . now , i said before its like a video game.its hard to explain but it just feels like it.the music even sounds like video games.the acting is really terrible.the actors say things like why is he doing this , oh he was nuts already and fine since he 's nuts i 'm going home ! also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break ! this movie has some errors but it is n't a classic like werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see demonicus !
this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class , their problems , relationships and interactions with each other . it should have managed a wider distribution as it 's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time . the swimming instructor is an almost-olympian , reduced to teaching adults basic lessons , and often the target of horndogging from his female students . he attempts , more or less , to fend them off , with varying results . the students characters are mainstream u.s.a ; teachers , policemen , college students and retired people , all of whom have n't learned to swim for some reason . the movie covers their relationships , including friends , relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class . several subplots provide amusing fodder , including a teacher going through a divorce , some high school students making a documentary , and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys . this is a good date movie , or just one to watch when you 're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality .
things to come is an early sci-fi film that shows an imagined world , or `` everytown '' through 100 years . you can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts . the film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the `` boss '' wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again , after everytown was bombed and war broke out . this film only has about 3 faults : it 's audio is muddy and video had some quirks , the characters are n't deep at all , and the overall plot is n't altogether solid . the plot is lacking something that i ca n't put my finger on ... it just seems a little `` fluffy . '' but if you love sci-fi and are interested in what h.g . wells though might happened in the next hundred years , this is a must see . it 's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing : a long , drawn-out war , because they were just about to go to war with germany , and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything . things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once .
brian dennehy , bill paxton , joe pantalino and , best of all , jeff fahey , all in one film . wow is all i can think to say about that . these are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together . it 's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film . the film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time , and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent . i can not describe how good it was to see bill paxton and jeff fahey together on screen , the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves , it almost brought a tear to my eyes . a good film , a great cast , go see . why ? four words , fahey , dennehy , paxton , pantalino .
if anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this film please read the bottom of this description : first telecast by cbs on november 30 , 2003 , the made-for-tv finding john christmas is a sequel to the previous year 's a town without christmas , with peter falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel max . valerie bertinelli plays kathleen mcallister , a divorced small-town nurse whose depression ... over the fact that the hospital er she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $ 100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist noah greeley ( david cubitt ) . the picture shows an act of bravery performed by noah 's firefighter brother hank ( william russ ) , who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and has n't been seen since . hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare , but this proves impossible when noah 's newspaper posts a $ 50,000 reward to identify hank , known only to the public as `` john christmas . '' and there 's something , very , very curious about that photo : it also shows a santa claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant . that elusive `` santa '' is of course the angelic max , who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems , dispense advice , tie up loose plot strands -- and even share a musical duet with kathleen 's talented daughter socorro ( jennifer pisana ) . interested in having a copy : write to me here : iamaseal2 @ yahoo.com
i swear , that zombie was killed like twice , and kept coming back . i gave this movie an 8 . let 's face it folks , this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying , i.e. , a `` handy-cam '' , shot film . hey , hey , hey , welcome to total indy film making . the fact that todd sheets got over 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents . yes , the story has gaps , yes , we see the same zombies over and over again , but who really cares ? take it for what it is , a fun and gory horror film , one to share with your buds , or to gross out the people you really care about lol . mellow out people , i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like `` titanic '' or `` twister '' instead . peace , and support independent film making ! ! !
i 've just finished listening to the director 's commentary for this film , and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film , like mann 's the insider , is completely subjective . it 's from howard 's pov . so , any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it , as ebert did , is really about nolte 's character actually . if you feel , as he did , that the film `` does not work '' , then you 're saying , i think , that howard does not work . and , to be frank , you might be right . howard 's reasoning and personality really would n't stand up to professional mental treatments and analysis . but , hey , that 's the nature of people . andrew .
stars : julianna donald , lonny price and louis zorich . cameos : art carney , brooke sheilds , liza minelli , james coco , joan rivers , dabney coleman , linda lavin , gregory hines and others . muppeteers : jim henson as kermit , rowlf , dr.teeth , swedish chef , waldorf , ernie and others . richard hunt as scooter , janice , statler and beaker . frank oz as fozzie bear , miss piggy , animal , bert , cookie monster and sam the eagle . jerry nelson as camilla the chicken , floyd pepper , lew zealand , crazy harry and pops . dave goelz as gonzo , zoot , beuregard and bunsen hunnydew . steve whittemire as rizzo the rat and others . another great muppet flick . this time , kermit , fozzie , miss piggy , scooter , rowlf , the electric mayhem , gonzo and camilla the chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they 're trying to get on broadway . after miserably failing at getting it produced , they all split up and go their separate ways . i love the characters and cameos . the songs in the film are `` together again '' , `` look at me , here i am '' , `` saying goodbye '' , `` and i 'm going to always love you '' , `` rat jazz '' and `` he 'll make me happy '' . frank oz directs this movie excellently and all the actors do a great job acting like the muppets are real . see it ! 91 minutes . rated g. my rating : a .
kiera nightly moved straight from the p & p set to this action movie ... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically . a great success in love actually and as lizie in jane austen 's classic , she is , once again , `` having a go '' . just as her bikini clad warrier woman in king arthur was more skin than muscle , it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life ... but then this is exactly what domino harvey ( the real one ) did , and i ( being one of nightly 's biggest fans ) believe she carries if off . stuff .... * 90210 ( for the non american world ) is the post code of beverly hills in la , where all the film stars live . * domino harvey father 's mostfamous film was manchurian candidate ( which appears in the film ) . * domino harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in june 2005 , after having been arrested for drug dealing . she had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film . * kiera knightly alludes to domino harvey 's sexuality in her interview with lucy liu . if you find this film a bit far fetched , then check out domino harvey , as the facts are more amazing than the fiction .
typical de palma movie made with lot 's of style and some scene 's that will bring you to the edge of your seat . most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller , is the style . it has some brilliantly edited scene 's and some scene 's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat . the best scene 's from the movie ; the museum scene and the elevator murder . there are some mild erotic scene 's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie . so this movie might not be suitable for everybody . the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work ! it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie . there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast . michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking ( not bad for a 49-year old ! ) . the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well , just like his score for the other de palma movie , `` body double '' . brilliant nerve wrecking thriller . i love de palma ! 10/10
return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series , and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga . with han solo imprisoned by jabba the hut and the empire building a new death star , the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side , and only our favourite heroes can pull it off . the opening sequence , set on tatooine , we see jabba 's palace , a pit of slavery and scum , and new home to han solo , as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue , and with luke 's jedi powers , they have the edge . we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end . han , leia and chewy battle it out on endor , desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the death star . the rebel fleet led by lando , battle with the imperial fleet while they wait for the shields to go down , and luke has a final showdown with darth vader . an epic end to a classic saga , and it 's only just of the pace of the first two . 10/10
now , admittedly , i 'm no ardent student of the genre . as a matter of fact , i 've tended always to shy away from westerns because , in spite of all their critical cachet as america 's primal stories ( or whatever ) , they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either `` shoot up the injuns , '' `` the big gunfight , '' or `` hey , let 's form a posse ! '' in other words , it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention , that it left precious little room for surprise or originality . ( and yes , i have seen at least some of the so-called `` greats '' , and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including stagecoach , rio bravo , my darling clementine , and of course the infamous [ but profoundly dull ] clint eastwood-sergio leone teamups in the '60s . ) but when i saw this movie on tv - as part of a commemorative jimmy stewart weekend upon his death - i finally got it : i understood , at least in theory , what the western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation ( aside from just action and thrills ) . it is the push-pull between lawlessness and order ; the american west represented freedom , but also the prospect of the wild , the untamed . respectable folk could get hurt out there . which , of course , meant that perhaps - just perhaps - it was n't meant for respectable folk , and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty , those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers , and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land . in such an environment , of course , the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free-spirited enough to be out there in the first place ( and so reject `` society , '' at least as it manifested itself on the eastern seaboard ) , and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just is not right . catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder in the main character himself is , i believe ( after seeing this movie ) , the highest and truest goal of any western . sadly , it is so often not the case , as the white hats are completely white , the black ones completely black ( and let 's not even get started talking about the indians , ok ) and there is precious little shades of gray in between . not in this one . jimmy stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold . he is joined in this by his lifelong buddy , played by walter brennan ( perhaps the western cliché character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here , as always ) - and no one else . pointedly , they are out for themselves , and while stewart displays his patented charm ( come on , we could never really dislike the guy , now could we ? ) , we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self-centered , self-interested character : none of his `` gosh '' or `` oh golly gee '' humanism is allowed to come through . or , rather , it has to be earned , by the end of the picture , in the way i described above . he must confront the lawlessness in himself , and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners ' starting point on their gold dust trail . this town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff , mr. gannon , played by john mcintire in one of the best `` bad guy '' performances i 've ever seen . he comes on with so much charm and humor , and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with stewart , that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he * is * the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in , it does so with double force . further , by establishing a type of breezy ( if necessarily guarded ) camaraderie between mcintire and stewart , the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are - and so how far a moral distance stewart must walk by the end of the film . i wo n't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes - see those for yourself ( as well as the rugged and gorgeous alaskan scenery - filmed on location , mind you , not cheap painted stills that the studio made up ) . what 's key here is how much this story focuses upon character , with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static ( read : `` talky '' ) . definitely one of the greatest performances i 've seen from stewart , showing he could play the renegade , the `` man 's man '' just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door . if anything , in fact , his `` everyman '' qualities lend greater strength to his characterization , making him seem less mythic or overblown - -like , say , eastwood or john wayne - and more a three-dimensional personage . his relationship with brennan is well-played : understated , but nevertheless touching ( with a faint suggestion of george and lenny from `` of mice and men '' - an altogether different type of `` western '' ) . i certainly have more westerns to see , but this is for now my favorite , and the yardstick by which i will necessarily judge all the others . it deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is .
this movie is not a kung fu movie . this is a comedy about kung fu . and if , before making this film , sammo hung had n't spent some time watching films by the great french comic filmmaker jaques tati ( i.ie. , e.g. , esp . jour de fête ) , he is certainly on the same wave length . personally , i think tati 's films are hilarious ; but they 're not to all tastes . some have told me that they loathe his work . i 've never figured out why , but i think it 's because the character that tati usually plays himself is so totally dead pan , so unaffected by the events around him ( which he is usually causing ) that many miss the more subtle comic bits happening around him . at any rate , tati 's main shtick - or at least his best known - is to take a pretentiously upright petite bourgeoisie with 19th century sensibilities and drop him into 20th century france where he must confront a society that is largely defined by the gradual eroding of those sensibilities . he usually has serious difficulties with little things like record players or radios . he 's a hazard in a car , but the world 's no safer when he rides a bicycle . but through it all , he never loses his aplomb , which is derived from his inner recognition that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th overall . in a similar fashion , the character sammo hung himself plays is a country boy come to the big city of hong kong , utterly convinced that what makes the city interesting is that bruce lee made kung fu movies there . this gets him into trouble in small ways , since he takes in stride happenstance which would never be noticed in a small town but which are deemed inappropriate in a big city - such as the moment when he appears to be urinating in the street , a cop stops him , only to discover that hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt , soaked during an accidental dip in the bay . what 's interesting about this gag is why it is hung does n't understand what the cop 's fuss is all about - in a country town , as long as no one 's looking , if you got ta go you got ta go . in other words , hung is not really urinating in the street - but he certainly would - and what 's the problem officer ? of course hung 's obsession with bruce lee also gets him into big troubles as well . he beats a gang of thugs who have refused to pay his restaurant-owner uncle . of course , in a bruce lee movie , the thugs would be considered trounced , and they would have learned their lesson . but in hung 's hong kong , reality unfortunately prevails , and the thugs return when he 's not around , to trounce his uncle . of course , hung finally triumphs in the end , just as tati always did . characters like this must always triumph ( at least in comedy ) because they are completely innocent , and as such , despite their comic missteps and misunderstandings , they really represent what is best in the humans we admire and wish to be . we do n't really want to be bruce lee ( who has to experience the loss of all of his friends before he gets a chance to beat the bad-guy ) , we , in our own innocence , really want a world where lee 's heroics are possible . unfortunately , that world only exists on film . `` ah , but what if ... ? '' - and in that question we find sammo hung at his comic best .
this very peculiar setting of wagner 's last opera definitely grew on me . when i first saw it , i was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images , and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story . however , if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherché `` gimmicks , '' i think you will find that the film does manage to capture the very strange , other-worldly atmosphere of the opera , and that there are moments which are particularly fine . personally , i never really understood the role of kundry until i saw how edith clever portrayed her . her performance ( a lip-synchronized mime of the singing voice of yvonne minton ) is nothing short of dazzling , from end to end , and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film . another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of robert lloyd of the crucial role of gurnemanz , one which lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world . i have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of gurnemanz on the stage of the metropolitan opera several times , and the lusciousness of his voice , and the warm , fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved , as did his performance in the character 's two major monologues , the karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in act 1 . the version i have seen was a videotape made for america , and so there were subtitles which , alas , could not be done away with . this is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera . this seemed to me to be quite contrary both to wagner 's clear avoidance of christianity , and his very deliberate attempt to `` generalize '' the christian elements of the story . ( see footnote with spoiler at the end of this review . ) i find it nearly impossible , when viewing a film with subtitles , to keep from absorbing them , and strongly recommend that , if in the dvd versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off , you do so , and instead , if the opera is unfamiliar to you , that you read the libretto carefully beforehand . the bottom line is that there is much in the film which i dislike , and would just as soon have seen done differently ... but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since i first saw it , and i find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again . __________________________________________________________________ footnote containing a spoiler : a good example would be kundry 's famous line , `` i saw him ... him ... and laughed . '' this gets translated , in the subtitles , for reasons which escape me , as `` i saw the savior 's face . '' it is especially irritating to me , because throughout the libretto , wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character who need not be the biblical jesus as `` der heiland , '' i.e. , the german for `` the healer '' -- a reference to the wound of amfortas , and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing .
exquisite comedy starring marian davies ( with the affable william haines ) . young peggy arrives in hollywood seeking stardom . cameo performances showcase `` all the stars in mgm 's heaven '' in the famous commissary scene , plus lots of vintage film making detail for the scholar . pic also captures for posterity davies ' famous , wickedly sarcastic impersonations of the top stars of the day ( her swanson is a beaut ! ) . `` peggy , '' even catches herself as she encounters the famous star marian davies at tennis , turns up her nose and comments , `` ohh , i do n't like her ! '' my print was perfect . story , direction , acting an authentic charm and a must for all silent afficinados .
i do n't like `` grade inflation '' but i just had to give this a 10 . i ca n't think of anything i did n't like about it . i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it . i 'm sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about , with j lo and richard gear , will be excellent , but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that i am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved , or its setting changed to a different culture . a story i found worth watching , and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort ! imagine that ! all the characters seemed well-developed , ... even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting , and the casting seemed very appropriate . it 's always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age , and perhaps this does n't quite qualify ( there is plenty of learning how to dance , but no singing ) but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man , successful with a family in japan , looking for something ... he knows not precisely what . to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film , thank you for creating and doing it .
i 'm writing this 9 years after the final episode was aired and i am still reeling from the impact wildside has had on me . it has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded . but it took it further and did n't stray from the realism of the streets , often portraying life events and characters down to a t. i am sorely missing this series , instead we have are given the stupid `` underbelly '' which is over dramatised and acted creating a whole load of american-esquire garbage . wildside stayed true to the uniqueness of sydney and for that i am truly indebted to this wonderful series . the acting was a-grade and it 's a shame to see only a few actors have furthered their career whilst others have faded into obscurity . i do n't want australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history , thus i ask the abc to release the complete series on dvd , not the first three . give this series the ending it deserves .
the real story ( took place in kansas in 1959 ) of a murder ( perry and dick , two ex-convicts who broke into a remote house on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met ) . richard brooks directed the chilling and disturbing capote 's book about the reasons that drove these kids to the crime ( are they natural born killers ? ) . the crime scenes are very brutal and haunting because of the lack of senses and reasons for what we witnessed . stunning black & white cinematography from conrand hall , excellent country - road music score from quincy jones , amazing performances in two principal roles from robert blake and scott wilson and first time in a movie a sad comment about capital punishment at the last moments before their deaths . jones , hall and brooks ( as director and as writer for adapted screenplay ) are academy award nominees . gripping , superbly directed and frightening , one of the best films of this decade
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . if you know the real world and the people from those shows , this movie will be top notch , if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you wo n't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show .
the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series ! mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama ! i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters ! explaining just enough to stay excited ! of course this show has some flaws ! in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason do n't show up in the third season ! many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just are n't there ! like rose and her husband ! where the hell are they ? what happened to them ? maybe they will return in later episodes ! but it is a little inconsistent ! that being said `` lost '' manages to be thrilling every episode ( especially the first two seasons ) ! that is a very hard thing to do ! i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show ! this is not a bad thing ! it even saves some episodes from getting boring ! one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters ! you will grow to love these characters ! good or bad ! but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure ! the danger of `` lost '' getting canceled due to declining ratings is near ! and that would be devastating !
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie . its got a pretty good plot , some good action , and the change of location for harry does not hurt either . sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that . eastwood is in good form as dirty harry , and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop . if you liked dirty harry , then you should see this one , its a lot better than the dead pool . 4/5
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it , and ended up really enjoying it . it lacked authenticity and believability- some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre , and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed ( perhaps this is typical of woody allen ? excuse my ignorance ) but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard . it was n't even at the jokes in the movie per se , but at the whole movie itself . the acting reminded me of seinfeld 's acting , where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes- they are corny , but if you do n't take the movie too seriously , you can really appreciate the humour of the actors , not the characters . if you 're looking for a random movie , and you like woody allen , i 'd definitely recommend it !
casting unknown michelle rodriguez as diana was a stroke of genius . she 's perfect . her acting inexperience actually works in her favor . we 've never seen her before so it really feels like her story . she also brings across genuine toughness . this works against her though , because we never doubt her . you never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we do n't think she can beat . so as a boxing movie , it fails . then again , this is n't really a boxing movie . how do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that is n't a boxing movie ? you do n't . but karyn kusama has anyway . like many indie films , `` girlfight '' defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life . diana is doing poorly in school . she beats up people she does n't like ( all the other girls in her school for example ) . she does n't fit in . her father is forcing her kid brother tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough . he gives tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives diana nothing , as if she has no need to defend herself , nor anything worthwhile to make of her life . tiny wants to go to art school ( cliche ' , yuck ) , so he gives up his boxing allowance to diana , who actually wants to box . things get complicated when diana falls for another boxer , adrian ( santiago douglas ) , who 's looking to turn pro . from there the story winds down toward the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title fight . what left me cold was that i never found any of this all that interesting . it 's all just a bit too believable . kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports . a lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances . the mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing , where anger is your friend . so this time it 's a girl . big deal . or there 's another position to take : finally , a boxing movie about a girl . women 's boxing has been around a long time . the brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people 's their lives and their feelings . the whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture . respect . overcoming adversity . self-discovery . i recommend `` girlfight '' because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director . the dialogue never rises above soap opera quality , but the story itself actually changed my view on some things . yes , the world now seems like a better place . a film did that . grade : b-
i typically do n't like reality shows , particularly the ones that are profiting off of `` american idol '' 's success . but this one i can live with . comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts , and if they like them , those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience . then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do `` survivor '' style competitions using comedic tactics . then one will be determined as `` last comic standing . '' i do like stand up comedy , so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests . there are usually some pretty funny comics selected through . it started the careers of such talents as alonzo bodden , ralphie may , and josh blue . my negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama . at first they lived together in a house like `` big brother , '' but now they 've done away with that , thank god . and there are a lot of comedians i felt , were only chosen not because they 're funny , but because of race , ethnicity , attitude , sex , etc . when other comics clearly should 've beaten them out . but overall , it 's a well-made reality show , which are two terms up until now i thought were an oxymoron .
i loved this movie ! chris showerman did an amazing job ! not only is he an incredible actor , but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique ! he did a great job on the delivery of his lines , plus transformed into george better than fraser did . a great performance for his first major roll ! this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love . my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out . in addition to the movie , the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious . two thumbs up on this one ! i highly recommend it to everyone !
a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude . keep your freddys and your jasons -- this film is in the same company as `` the haunting '' ( the original ) . lyrical and truthful , it stays with you long into the night , much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows . a smart rent .
i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting . it was raw and honest and felt as if i was really watching the `` real people '' not actors . it 's great entertainment , it also painted the people as human on our level not below us . it is a very good film .
it was an excellent piece to the puppet series because this film showed all of the series , from one to seven . and this was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because i would have never guessed that the puppets would be in pain . plus it showed some of the puppet master series that i did n't see and i what to see it so badly like part two . it showed an appearance of torch which can turn things and humans , which is cool , and showed the return of the puppet master from part one . it also showed little aliens from part 4 that was also cool , it showed other people episodes that might be good to them and it did.so thanks to this puppet master is going to be a big hit .
i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto , a short film festival in guanajuato , mexico . one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction . the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed : one long continuous shot of a futuristic paris in glorious black and white . i should n't go on with the details 'cause i think it is a film worth seeing . the sci-fi story might be found average for many ... to me was really good . the action is great , the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere . things you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully . the cast performance is good , in my opinion no one hits the wrong note . now , the thing that i found awesome is the animation . 3d grafics look 2d . a bw comic book brought to life . the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand ( i 'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth ) . the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film : 7 years ! the director , she said , is brilliant , but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv . so , many people had true faith in them . they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them . do n't miss it . i think you wo n't regret it ... maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think .
classic , highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director carpenter and star curtis . seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on halloween . halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece ! carpenter 's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt ! the direction often consists of such simple elements , shadows , dark streets , creaking doors , that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy . carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling , that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage ! plus , he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong . highest kudos also go to carpenter 's simple , yet frighteningly unnerving music score . in a sense , halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film ! the cast is excellent . young jamie lee curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter laurie strode , she 's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films . the great donald pleasants does a perfect performance as a myer 's doctor , who 's desperate to capture him again . supporting cast loomis , soles , castle , and others are good too . so like its own villain , halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill . it is a must for all genre fans ! * * * * out of * * * *
this is my favorite movie ever . i have watched it at least 10 times and i cry every time . my family begs me not to watch it so i wont have a crying fit . i think i love that it is a true story written by antwone himself just as much as i love the movie . the acting is top notch , and the actors were perfect for their role . denzel washington is one of my favorite actors . but this is my favorite movie he has done so far . i took care of a little boy who was also born in jail . he was the most precious little boy i had ever met . he has now been adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years . i saw this movie while the fight was still going on and his future was unsure and i am so happy he is safe and loved . and i am so happy antwone 's happy and found his family . i would love to know more about him and how it has been since meeting his family . i just cant say enough good things about it ! !
`` capitães de abril '' is a very good . the story is n't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in portugal . but it gives us an idea of how it was like . the fiction of the story is n't of great interest , but it does n't spoil the movie . the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia are n't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds . captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of april revolution . all the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully . lisbon looks beautiful as ever . do n't miss it ! i liked this film very much .
when the scientist and family man matt winslow ( robert urich ) finally accepts the invitation to work the micro-digitech corporation in a space suit project , he moves with his beloved wife patricia ( joanna cassidy ) and their son robbie ( barret oliver ) and daughter chrissy ( soleil moon frye ) to a huge modern house in the corporation compound . they meet their friend tom peterson ( joe regalbuto ) and his family completely adapted to the new lifestyle , and tom invites the winslow family to join the steaming springs country club . tom tries to seduce matt telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in micro-digitech , but matt is not tempted with the offer . later he is introduced to the director of the club , jessica jones ( susan lucci ) that befriends patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children . matt feels the changing in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club , finding an evil secret about jessica and the members . in the 80 's , when i saw `` invitation to hell '' , i liked this movie that partially recalls `` the stepford wives '' , with people changing the behavior in a suburban compound . i have just seen it today , and i found a great metaphoric message against the big corporations , when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries . i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story , but i believe it fits perfectly . my vote is seven . title ( brazil ) : `` convite para o inferno '' ( `` invitation to hell '' )
10 out of 10 , this brilliant , super documentary is a must see , with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years , untill this was screened in 1974 . the film clips in this documentary from the war does n't miss out anything , some of the clips left me dumbstuck . the whole series is over 20 episodes long , and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war . simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still , and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch . you must watch this at some time , even if it 's a few episodes , even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war , in a world at war ..
saw this again recently on comedy central . i 'd love to see jean schertler ( memama ) and emmy collins ( hippie in supermarket ) cast as mother and son in a film , it would probably be the weirdest flicker ever made ! hats off to waters for making a consistently funny film .
very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes . she enlists the aid of a police cadet , and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record . an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat .
i saw the movie recently and really liked it . i surprised myself and cried . this movie is in the same niche genre as `` away from her '' - or even `` the bucket list '' but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity . it 's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as hagar . the director does a masterful job with the challenge . hagar 's hard to understand . her world has hard edges and she is n't a warm endearing woman at all . the first scene gets this across without any compromise . hagar ( ellen burnstyn ) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law . she figures it out en-route and freaks out . her edges are really hard . she is mean . she is belittling and selfish . she is a stone . i did n't like her - not even a little bit . throughout the course of the movie , we get insight . we find out why she does n't like petunias , why she favors one son over the other , how her losses have formed her character ... i started to see the angel ... and i started to like her . i especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack . ellen burnstyn , you are a brilliant actor . kudos . kudos . kudos . what a scene ! this is n't a `` feel good '' movie , but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy . i understand more clearly that hard edges in a person 's life are there to protect , they are there for a reason ... hagar is n't my mother - she is n't even my mother-in-law or neighbor ... but parts of her are present in many women ( and men ) in my life . those parts somehow make more sense to me now that i 've watched the stone angel .
buffs of the adult western that flourished in the 1950s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome . of course , we can go back to howard hawks 's red river ( 1948 ) or further still to john ford 's my darling clementine ( 1946 ) , but if we want to stick with this single decade , then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that era 's initial year . one is `` the gunfighter , '' an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger ( ringo ) facing his last shootout . another from that same year is `` winchester '73 , '' and it 's worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim , mustached , highly realistic range riders . in the gunfighter , he 's the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang . in winchester , he 's the sidekick to jimmy stewart , a kind of horatio to stewart 's hamlet in this epic/tragic tale . the plot is simple enough : stewart 's lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match , beating the meanest man in the west ( stephen mcnally ) , who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father . when the brother steals the gun , stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier , meeting up with both outlaws and indians . ( in one wonderful bit , two future stars - rock hudson and tony curtis - play an indian chief and a u.s. cavalry soldier - during a well staged pitched-battle . dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader , while shelly winters , just before she began to gain weight , is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together . today , filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen , but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time , with not a minute wasted . such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp ( terrifically played by will geer ) make brief appearances , adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature . the final battle between good and bad brothers , high atop a series of jutting rock canyons , is now legendary among western buffs . it 's also worth noting that stewart , however much associated he became with western films , does what is actually his first western leading man role here - yes , he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier , but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns !
this movie is not schlock , despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions . a dark fable for adults . exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies , and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme . a weird movie with enticing visuals : shadows and contrast are prominent . definitely worth a look , especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence . through all the cruelty and wickedness , a moral , albeit twisted , can be gleamed .
i liked this movie very much . although this movie does n't boast of big ( or even known ) names , its very charming . its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gon na be just fine in the end . my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part . i rate this movie at 7.5
let 's cut a long story short . i loved every minute of it . a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style . there 's an evil magician , a pretty princess , a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after . modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic . only quibble : the special effects are pretty dated ( loved sabu with the djinn 's foot , though ! )
late , great grade z drive-in exploitation filmmaker par excellence al adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci-fi soft-core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw-dropping stupidity . in the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the big brother-like impotent bumbling idiot the controller ( an amusingly goofy erwin fuller ) . however , sweet'n'sexy cinderella ( radiant blonde cutie pie catherine erhardt ) remains determined to change things for the better . with the help of her effeminate fairy godfather ( a flamboyantly campy jay b. larson ) , cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud tom prince ( the dorky vaughn armstrong ) and teaching everyone that making love is a positive , pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity . adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all-thumbs incompetence , staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair . the uproariously abysmal `` we all need love '' number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel ; ditto the equally abominable `` mechnical man '' routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots . louis horvarth 's crude , static cinematography , the tacky plastic miniatures , sparky sugerman 's groovy throbbing disco score , the copious gratuitous nudity ( ravishing brunette hottie sherri coyle warrants special praise in this particular department ) , the brain-numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor ( roscoe the robot law enforcer is especially irritating ) , and the uniformly terrible performances ( renee harmon 's outrageously hammy portrayal of cinderella 's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here ) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy .
it 's easy to make really general comments about a film like this . the fact that it 's one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it `` started japanese cinema '' and was `` unlike anything the west ever made . '' the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off `` caligari '' on more than one occasion . but style was meant to be imitated , and does n't take away from this film 's importance . what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles , opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities . for this purpose , the madhouse is the ideal setting , and the writers knew this . this is a landmark film , and every effort should be made to track it down . 5 out of 5 - essential
i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago , after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5 . nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is . i have n't enjoyed anything as much since firefly ( also and amazing show ) . i 'll admit season 2 wqas n't quite as good , but there are still some amazing episodes ( see designate this , bag 'em , the berrisford agenda , harbor lights , freak nation etc . ) and alec is great . i 've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3 , and i have to say , i ca n't believe it was cancelled - i wo n't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked ! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie ( although at the moment it seems highly unlikely ) . as proof of my obsessiveness , max 's barcode number is 332960073452 , and in the two weeks i 've had it , i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice . it 's just too good .
i love this show and my 11 year-old daughter and i love watching it together . it teaches good old fashioned values in a fun , adventuresome and entertaining way ( albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time ) . it 's also really fun to make fun of ... you know , rewind and insert your own dialog , in place of the actors ' . i have my dvr set to record all the episodes and i happened to catch the tail end of an episode ( just prior to the next one starting ... so i do n't know what episode it was ) but there was an absolutely terrible sequencing mistake ! adam had handed sheriff coffee a small swatch of `` leather '' , which was torn from some outlaw 's coat as he tried to make his getaway , i suppose . well , roy happened to have the coat , so he laid it out on his desk and placed the swatch right where it had been torn from . the swatch was exactly rectangular ... which i reckon would be nearly impossible to tear from a piece of leather ( post-1950 's naugahyde ? yes . leather ? i do n't think so ) . well , the swatch lined up perfectly and the mystery was solved . not 10 seconds later in the scene , we see the coat again , still lying on roy 's desk . but this time the swatch is more like the shape of north carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat ( but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the coat ) and the seam ( which was smack-dab in the middle of the swatch ) is now gone ... as is the seam in the coat . my daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again ! it 's prime for youtube , i tell ya ! we still totally love the show though and the sequencing errors make it lots of fun !
difficult film to comment on , how do you say it 's bad ? well it is n't , but then it 's equally difficult to say it is good . what it is , is compelling viewing , it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there . it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life , you know you want to turn away but you have to watch . the naudet brothers handle the commentary very well , even in the most tragic of circumstances , there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults . the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on . you ca n't change history , and you should not want , this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour .
like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons , this movie has humor at different levels . i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son . both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times ... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan . the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times ... the adult-level humor ( that is , humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences , no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here ) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults . for example of the adult level humor , the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors . the martian pilot , blaznee , has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson ; the scientist , that of peter seller 's dr. strangelove . the special effects are surprisingly good for this film . the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie 's favor , and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles ' needs over box-office draw power ( an excellent example is wayne alexander 's `` vern '' character ) . i had to write this review ... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now . good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie .
yokai monsters : spook warfare ( yokai daisenso , 2005 ) a movie about `` yokai '' or traditional japanese `` monsters '' of folklore . it is alternatively known as big monster war or as ghosts on parade . the yokai of the first installment include the teapot freak , kappa water imp , a living 'brella , a woman whose sheeks can grow extremely gigantic , a woman with a second face on the back of her head , a dwarf priest with an enormous gourd-like wrist , & so on . these sorts of whimsical monsters derive not only from fairy lore , but from a type of summer entertainment of the tokugawa era , comparable to today 's halloween haunted houses , or the `` freak shows '' of yesteryear but with exclusively phony freaks . ghosts & goldfish monsters & dancing one-headed umbrellas were trumped up to create `` chills '' during the hot summers . the fatcheek woman & such were recreated by tricks or illusions , based on monsters depicted in medieval scrolls ; & if their design for the movie is a bit simple & hoky , this makes them all the more representative of what historically was recreated for summer chills . these rather endearing monsters have to face off & destroy an ancient babylonian vampire demon who has come to japan & disguised himself as a samurai lord . despite that some of the japanese apparitions are a bit goofy , & too many of the costumes scarsely more than masks without even moving lips as they speak , it is all played very poker-faced & is very charming . it has some beautiful cinematography , much as would be provided in a cgi film of the same decade . viewed in the right mood or with the right friends , it is exciting , moving & touching . yoshiyuki kuroda also directed the famed lone wolf & cub : white heaven & hell ( 1974 ) & and was the special fx director for the excellent daimajin trilogy . the yokai monsters series is not the equal of majin at its best , but the yokai are nevertheless great fun . the first miike movie which is the most child-oriented of his family films , with the gozu & izoo consecutively more serious though none too severe for young viewers .
after garbo 's introduction to sound in clarence brown 's `` anna christie '' , jacques feyder made a german version of the movie where all of the cast , except for garbo , were different . while the american version is still more available in the usa and most of the american viewers have primarily seen this version , the germna `` anna christie '' is more likely to be viewed in europe . as i have seen both films , i feel the right to compare the two closely-knit productions . is jacques feyder 's film different ? is it better than clarence brown 's ? in this analysis , i would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common . they have identical sets , very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes . here , you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life . here , you also have the humorous , though a bit shorter , sequence in the amusement park . however , when emphasizing garbo herself , i address the first difference . she does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking . the viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks , which occurred , most probably , to 1931 viewers . garbo was very good in american film and she is also very good here . yet , to me , she seems even more genuine in the german version . it is noticeable that garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much ( the effort that was artificially created by the sensation : garbo talks ! ) . her german is not very well pronounced ; yet no one cares : everything is perfectly understood . therefore , i can easily say the same i did in my american version comment : skaal greta garbo ! yet , the film differs in one very important issue : the rest of the cast . here comes the question : which portrayal seems more captivating , which one is better for sure ? the differences are filled with varieties . salka viertel ( or salka steuerman ) , garbo 's lifelong friend , does not do the equally great job as marie dressler in the role of marthy owens . she is not bad , she is different , sometimes overacts ( from today 's perspective ) but is no longer that genuine in the role as marie dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time . some people even claim that dressler was better than garbo in the film and that opinion , though appears to be questionable of course , carries some truth . theo shall is more sympathetic as matt than charles bickford but when applied to him , this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks . who shines in the german `` anna christie '' , who is really worth greatest attention is hans junkermann in the role of chris christopherson , anna 's father . george f. marion vs hans junkermann is like a day vs night difference . junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict , a man with hopes , with fears , who overdoes the care of his daughter . the scene of anna 's first meeting with her father is truly magnificent , the opening moment of chris ' conversation with marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance . junkermann is the chris whom you like , who you sometimes laugh at , whom you sympathize with , who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind . great ! if you have seen the american `` anna christie '' and have a chance to get the german version , i would highly recommend to you this movie because it 's a slightly different look at the story , a nice and accurate way to compare , a fine enrichment to clarence brown 's movie and , foremost , a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance : hans junkermann 's . skaal or prost , hans junkermann !
this is the only david zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind . the funniest movie of 98 with night at the roxbury right behind but i did not think theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he . dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews.anyway see it you wont be dissapionted
`` why did they make them so big ? why did n't they just give the money to the poor ? '' the question about cathedrals was asked by a student to mr. harvey during a school field trip to salisbury cathedral . `` that 's a good question , '' he replied . `` partly to inspire them - to get them to look up with awe . '' i 'm not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone , but this movie certainly had that impact on me . it was awesome ! it did n't start out that way . for a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of - well - a school field trip to salisbury cathedral . if you 've ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it . you have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day , the bus driver who 's driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control . been there , done that , got the t-shirt was my initial reaction . i figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students . yawn ! but it turns out to be so much more ! timothy spall was brilliant as mr. harvey - a sombre , unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals . over the course of the movie , his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story . we also get introduced to some of the troubled students - most notably helen , also brilliantly played by nathalie press , who 's into self-mutilation . this is n't a religious movie , but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes . when harvey 's colleague jonathon ( played by ben miles ) says `` i do n't care what anyone believes as long as they do n't try to force it on anyone else '' harvey replies , `` that is n't tolerance - it 's indifference ! '' - which is , in fact ( in my opinion ) what often passes for religious tolerance in our society . there are scenes of reconciliation between various characters , and the final scene of the movie was brilliant . as harvey climbs back on the bus , director susanna white has the camera slowly pan upwards , so that the final shot is simply of the sky - hearkening back to harvey 's comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe . the cathedral accomplishes its goal . we look up into the universe in awe , seeking something greater than ourselves , however we choose to define it . this is a very powerful and very inspiring movie . 9/10
i watched this movie every chance i got , back in the seventies when it came out on cable . it was my introduction to harlem , which has fascinated me ( and bill clinton ) ever since . i was still very young , and the movie made a big impression on me . it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up , trying to decide whom they wanted to be , and making some bad choices as well as good ones . i was dazzled by lonette mckee 's beauty , the great dresses they eventually got to wear , and the snappy dialogue . as someone being raised by a single mother as well , i could really identify with these girls and their lives . it 's funny , these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles !
lily powers works at a speakeasy until her father dies.she then goes to new york to work at an office building.there she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they want.and what men want is her ... well , you know.alfred e.green 's baby face ( 1933 ) is a movie of high sexual content.for a movie of that era , anyway.this was one of the last pre-code films that were made.barbara stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as lily.other actors of this film include george brent ( courtland trenholm ) , donald cook ( ned stevens ) , alphonse ethier ( adolf cragg ) , henry kolker ( j.p.carter ) , margaret lindsay ( ann carter ) and theresa harris ( chico ) .the young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy jr.this movie deals with a brave topic and it does it good.baby face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch .
i have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting dvd that the criterion company releases . i figure that even if i dislike the movie , criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film . i read up on them , and i buy the ones which are the most interesting to me . le million is my latest purchase , and i must say that i was not disappointed in the film . it is cheery , funny , and romantic . everything about it is quite excellent . the songs are wonderful . if i understood french , i would probably hum them and sing them all day long . the acting is very good for this kind of movie . american musicals of the classic hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story , but in le million , the characters are rather well developed and the story , while not being anything extremely impressive , is not at all lacking . i loved the developments of the relationships , especially the relationship between the once best friends michel and prosper . the romantic moments are also very well developed . the direction is nearly perfect , with several very memorable moments . probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument . they hide on the stage of an opera performance , and the opera singers sing lines which the couple , michel and beatrice , interpret to their own situation . this is definitely one of the high points in cinema history . the scene managed to make me laugh , to win me over with a very sweet romance , and make me smirk at just how clever the director was . i give this film a 9/10 . p.s . - some information for anyone who has the same faith in criterion that i do and is planning to buy it . amongst the criterion discs i now own , le million contains the fewest features . all it has is a photo gallery ( not all that useful ; one might flip through it once ) and a rare television interview with rene clair , the director . this piece is of some interest . he was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film , and when talkies were first appearing , he said that they represented the death of film . i think most film-savvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that , but it is interesting to hear him explain it . also , if you have read the description of this movie on amazon.com , please note that they were wrong in one important respect : not every line in the film is sung . in fact , it contains no more songs than a regular musical . it is actually a lot more like a chaplin or buster keaton or marx brothers film . my criticisms of the disc are not that important . heck , criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints . the fact is , their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 ( now 21 ! ) people have voted for on imdb , and only about a hundred people , if that , will ever see the film . heck , if you look at the criterion web site , le million is nowhere to be found . i have no clue why not . it 's something they should really be proud of ( of course , their web site is surprisingly horrible ) . they did a fine job on this film . bravo ! they deserve all the money i can stand to give them !
i love this episode of columbo . maybe it 's because ruth gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer abigail mitchell , an american version of dame agatha christie . she is delicious to watch as the perky , lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident . she blames her niece 's husband , the nephew . she plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her . i would have loved somebody else than mariette hartley to play veronica . i never really like hartley in anything personally . and of course with columbo , there are some laughs like when he questions veronica at a belly-dancing class . ruth 's abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk .
my short comment for this flick is go pick it up . chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller . there is no way the character of miklos , claiming and pushing for room in every way possible , wont push your nerves to the edge ... 2 thumbs up !
loosely based on the james j corbett biography `` the roar of the crowd '' , gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett , but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s . the story follows corbett { a perfectly casted errol flynn } from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico , thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world , john l sullivan { beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond } . not all the fights are in the ring tho , and it 's all the spin off vignettes in corbett 's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture . there are class issues to overcome here { perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two } , and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers , but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does . along with the quite wonderful corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jim . the film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you alexis smith } . the fight sequences stand up really well , and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was , his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history . as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context , and it 's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner , and as far as this viewer goes .............. it will do for me to be sure to be sure , 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture .
once again , i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88 . fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap ( i mean horrible beyond belief ) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good . this movie is much better than i expected . i found it very engaging , though it was obviously made by an amateur . the direction is nothing special , but the story is intriguing with some good thrills . i expected it to be more of a comedy , but i was n't too disappointed . for a thriller , this movie is surprisingly good-natured . there 's no bloody violence , no profanity , no nudity , no sex . usually , these movies require all four of those elements . the pg rating is well-deserved -- not like `` sixteen candles '' where the `` f '' word is used twice and there 's a brief gratuitous nude scene . i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could 've been developed more . the film does tend to be plot-heavy , and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side . instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them , we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors . they end up kissing at the end , but there 's so little chemistry that it seems forced . `` the dream machine '' is no gem , but it 's good , clean entertainment . it 's quite forgettable -- especially with a cast of unknowns , except for haim -- but it 's also much better than you 'd expect . my score : 7 ( out of 10 )
shall we dance is an excellent film because it shows how something , like dancing , can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit . dance is seen as the expression of existence , and the birth of individuality . the is certainly the case with aoki . at work he is a humble office denizen , but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released . surprisingly , this release is frowned upon in japan , due to the rigid culture of conformity . at the start of the film , all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance . they will be scorned , or deemed perverted , for expressing their passion through dance . this film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions . it will leave a smile on your face for days .
having only seen two of his pictures previously , i 've come to terms with altman . before , though , i always labeled his style of film-making `` boring . '' you just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his crazy genius . `` health '' is fairly underrated , and very questionably out of print . in fact , i do n't think it 's ever even been issued to vhs . why is that ? when all of these crappy films get dvd releases daily , this one is left behind for no good reason ? honestly , i had no real problems with this film . it was , for the most part , consistently amusing and funny . almost all of the scenes are mysteriously interesting for some reason , be it the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances . there is real skill here . and paul dooley 's stint on the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating . if you can , try to find a copy of this forgotten little gem . it 's not perfect , but it 's much better than most of the sludge out there getting dvd releases . hell , i 'd be happy with a nice vhs copy of this thing . it 's often on the fox movie channel , though , so look out for it .
i 'll be honest with you ... i liked this movie . it 's a great zombie flick that is packed with action , original ideas , good acting , but is also packed with bad zombie effects . part iv , entitled `` after death '' is also good . i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere . 10 out of 10 fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master , skinned alive , slumber party massacre , sleep away camp , and other full moon pictures flicks . for other recommendations , check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section .
johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories . the music is great , you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like ( i 've been there too ) , and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion . cash 's narration is good too . but .... 1 . the actor who played jesus was miscast . 2 . there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music . 3 . because it is uncompelling , i doubt we 'll see this ever widely distributed again . i 'd love to buy the cd . tom paine texas , usa
the movie starts out with a bunch of dead men walking peeps sitting in individual cells , waiting for their inevitable meeting with death represented by the electrical chair . then our `` hero '' , who is called tenshu , is taken to the chair , he 's zapped , and then .... he 's still `` alive '' . aha ! he is given a choice by some creepy military guys who look really cool : either we zap you until we 've made sure you 're actually dead or you can walk through this door and take whatever destiny might lie ahead of you '' . our hero says yes to option 2 , and then the actual story commences . he wakes up in a different sort of cell ( very high-tech and very big ) , where he finds another cell-mate , who also managed to survive the electric boogie-ride . a voice in the speakers tells them that they are free to do whatever they wish , as long as it happens within that room . sounds a little suspicious , but the two men accept : what else can they do ? what these two men do not know is that they have been set together , so they can awaken an inner urge to kill within them . basically the unknown scientists in the background p * * s them off until they decide that they should kill each other . sounds weird ? indeed , but there 's a greater purpose to all of this . this is the part which should not be revealed , and so it shall remain unrevealed . but fear not , it is the unknown that lures the viewer to watch more of this pseudo-action movie , fore it has an entirely different approach to the question : how long time can you stand being with a man who 's an s.o.b . and would you kill him to obtain freedom ? the first hour is basically trying to awaken your interest , it sneaks up without you actually knowing it . then it becomes a roller coaster ride with wild matrix-like action fight-scenes with a touch of individuality to honor the comic book from which the movie is based upon . the movie is indeed very special , so special that normal cinemas wo n't view it under normal circumstances . however , the story is fascinating , the music is fantastic , and the actors do their bit ( some more than others ) to make the movie truly unique . if you should be so fortunate that your cinema or video store has it , watch it , and enjoy the fact that not everyone is trying to make mainstream movies to earn huge bunches of cash .
this , despite not being the original - it began life as a play in central europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed ( mgm 's own remake with period songs in the good old summertime , the broadway show she loves me , even the excellent theatre revival in paris a couple of years ago ) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat . several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try , for example , removing ugarte , ferrari , renault etc from casablanca and yes you 'd still have rick and ilsa and viktor lazslo but they 'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below . jimmy stewart and maggie sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of frank morgan , felix bressart , joseph schildkraut and andy hardy 's sara haden and this is before we factor in that lubitsch 'touch ' . okay , maybe they were a tad more naive , innocent even , in that jurassic age but how many genuine film lovers , sated with scatology , screwing and in-your-face sex , turn back to those days of stories , style , slickness and skill and wallow in great movies like this one . by far the best thing about this technological age is not csi but dvd that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it .
sublimity is the way we have to reach for the beauty . and sublimity is the stuff this film is made of . if not his best , it 's my most loved of all bogdanovich movies . this unique masterpiece remind us , as most of the other films from the director , what life is ( or should be ) about : love , lost ( or failure ) and hope and faith and charity . as the song from whom the films takes its title ( gershwin 's well known composition ) the film makes the impossible true , and tries to make us aware that no-one is able to judge anybody ; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction ( the first ten minutes , with the detectives following the ladies , almost without a line of dialogue , constructed upon the looks and views of the characters -- with that `` bogdanovich touch '' based on the point-of-view -- is a class on cinema language , something that p.b . learned well from his admired directors from the golden age of the movies ) . with a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack ( including the best of sinatra 's `` trilogy '' ) , this movie , full of self-consciousness and compassion , and far away from self-indulgence and emptiness ( as some critics wrote ) , deserves a better place on the history of american cinema than where it have been placed . it 's not `` long on style , short on substance '' : it is complex in its simplicity , and beautiful , absolutely beautiful .
this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen ( thanks to rick baker et al ) . back in the late 80 's i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three jc , sh & yb . i was n't sure what to expect when i payed my hard earned money to see this in a `` triple bill of classics '' at the old scala . i need not have worried , i was left breathless by this movie . if you 're a fan of hong kong action / kung fu movies and have n't seen this movie , do so now !
this picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of sheriff buford pusser . bo svenson takes over the role of sheriff buford pusser , and luke askew plays the role of mobster pinky dobson . the last that we saw sheriff pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed sunday morning drive . after pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife . is pusser able to complete the revenge that he 's after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes . the only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story . how could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet do n't do anything about it . since there was real no name actress in this picture i ca n't give it 10 weasel stars but i can give 8
i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv . i remember my father remarking that `` this is how it could have happened - adam and eve . '' i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve , her eyes were blackened . i asked my father why were her eyes blackened and he told because she was tired and hungry . having not seen this episode in 45 years , i still remember it vividly - the tv transmissions back and forth with the home planet , scenes of bombs shaking the headquarters , with the final scene of the two walking off , adam carrying his pack and eve following . it may not have been a theatrical work of art , but it certainly left an impression on me all these years .
this is a great , ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s ' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was . i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid . it does n't help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown 's graveyard when i was ten . turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan . so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile , but i love it now , as a 24 year old . i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover , but to my surprise , it ruled . it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal . and you got ta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd . this movie is awesome , if you love 80s metal and bad movies , this one 's for you . 9/10 !
i really in enjoyed watching this movie . like most of the people that watched it . i was n't sure that i was getting . whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies ; i.e . sister act . however this was not really comedy . it is a drama with comedic moments . so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking . this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood . i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie . this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks , but also about relations with in the black community . i do think that it is worth a chance . if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie is n't for you
rated e i never actually owned a nintendo 64 but i have played one many times.in my opinion along with conkers bad fur day , super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the nintendo 64 system.i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.if you have an n64 and do n't have this game you should try to find it.the original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment.the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game.you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the 120 power stars from bowzer.now you can do it in a 3d environment.super mario 64 is a very fun and good n64 game and i recommend it . 10/10
i love tudor chirila and maybe that 's why i enjoyed the movie so much . two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert . i saw the trailer and the video `` zmeu '' before the movie and i thought i had it all figured .. i was wrong : instead of a good movie i assisted a great one ! i felt the movie . it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of all it pictured love .. i ca n't even begin to describe the soundtrack .. so i wo n't : ) i 'm not a movie critic .. i ca n't describe it in more words .. my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless .. thank god for the keyboard : ) thank you tudor giurgiu , thank you maria popistasu , thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila . encore ! : )
this film has very tight and well planned dialogue , acting and choreography . recommended film for anyone who wants to see masterful writing and plot . question : does anyone know where the house is actually located ? it is one of the most interesting houses , a 19thc windmill .
i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you 're planning a romantic evening with him/her . the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen . after the original film , we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . jane 's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan 's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually in love . one 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually . and jane 's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality . the skin show in this film is off the charts . in addition to jane 's two-piece sexy midriff , leg , and hip baring costume , she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan . ( although it is not o'sullivan , but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene ) weissmuller , also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth . the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips . it 's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry . although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come , they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .
i remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoying this . i recently had the opportunity to watch it again , for the first time since then , as it was aired on `` walt disney presents '' on the disney channel . i 'd forgotten most of it , and some of it was geared towards kids , but it was still enjoyable . i ca n't wait to show it to my niece and nephews .
it 's not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you 're not 100 % sure of your mental stability , because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are . i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film , so the majority of the viewers would n't have the level of `` maturity '' to reach in to its delightful side . kind of like tarkovsky films , but different in a way . i , myself , ca n't say i had a lot of fun watching it . but it 's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliché that hollywood offers . hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over . you ca n't simply sit back and watch it , you 'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film . a film that 's similar to this in style is nachtgestalten , but it was considerably better , and way less violent . this one for instance , is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad-tempered . most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film . i give it a 9 because i 've seen the multiple-stories-in-one-film phenomenon in another film and it was better . but this one 's an outstanding piece on its own . worth watching , but get ready to see something disturbing .
obviously written for the stage . lightweight but worthwhile . how can you go wrong with ralph richardson , olivier and merle oberon .
abu , the thief of bagdad , helps king ahmed regain his kingdom from a wicked sorcerer . as europe was going to war and significant sections of the world was going up in flames , sir alexander korda 's london films unveiled this lavish escapist fare from the legends of the arabian nights . replete with swords & sorcery , it gave audiences in 1940 a short respite from the headlines . it also is a fine piece of film making , featuring good acting and an intelligent script . conrad veidt gets top billing and he deserves it , playing the evil magician jaffar . his saturnine face with its piercing eyes makes one recall the macabre roles he played with such relish during silent days . here is a villain worth watching . as the boyish thief , sabu is perfectly cast in this , his third film . while not a hero in the typical sense of the word , his character is certainly heroic in deed & action . the rest of the cast do fine work . john justin is both energetic & sensitive as the unenlightened king who must learn about the realities of live the hard way ; sabu gets a significant part of the action ( when he 's not transformed into a dog ) but justin is appropriately athletic when needs must . lovely june duprez plays the endangered princess of basra , coveted by two very different men . appearing late in the film , massive rex ingram shakes things up as a genie with an attitude . allan jeayes uses his fine voice to good advantage as the storyteller . miles malleson gets another eccentric role as the childlike sultan of basra , forever dithering on about his mechanical toys ( malleson was also responsible for the film 's screen play & dialogue ) . aged morton selten portrays the benevolent king of legend . mary morris , later an exceptional stage actress , plays the dual roles of jaffar 's accomplice and the six-armed silver dancer . the film was begun in britain , but wartime difficulties made korda move it to southern california , which probably explains the presence of american ingram in the cast . the art direction , in vibrant technicolor , is most attractive , especially the fairy tale architecture in blues , whites & pinks . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * born sabu dastagir in 1924 , sabu was employed in the maharaja of mysore 's stables when he was discovered by korda 's company and set before the cameras . his first four films ( elephant boy-1937 , the drum-1938 , the thief of bagdad-1940 , jungle book-1942 ) were his best and he found himself working out of hollywood when they were completed . after distinguished military service in world war ii he resumed his film career , but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films , black narcissus ( 1947 ) being the one great exception . his final movie , walt disney 's a tiger walks ( 1964 ) was an improvement , but it was too late . sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963 , only 39 years of age .
anne brontes epic novel the tenant of wildfell hall should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms . its a fantastic story and tells the `` real '' truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband . its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book . based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the 1840s . do watch this film , its a great version of the book and very moving indeed . i 'm sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced . excellent acting and great locations .
to me movies and acting is all about telling a story . the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account . in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best . to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel , made this story all the more compelling . you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman , gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life . susan hayward 's fear , reluctance , but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her . one could also feel david 's anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home . as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle . raymond massey 's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger . the sets were real enough , and the atmosphere believable . all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it 's kind . i gave it a rating of ten .
this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment - its the best ending of any movie i 've ever seen . perfect , beautiful , funny , simply wonderful . i found this movie delightful , even with it 's french taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on . i loved it - it 's a great love story . and i loved the way algerians were woven in - and by the way , the music during the final credits is great . i want the cd !
before there was crash , there was this interesting film called grand canyon . released about 14 years sooner than the former film , grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime . to me crash was still a slightly better film , but grand canyon was no slouch either . taking place in los angeles , an upper-class lawyer named mack ( kevin kline ) takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time . he calls for a tow truck , and has to wait for awhile , only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car . soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment , and out steps simon ( danny glover ) to take the truck away . both men are threatened , but simon manages to get himself , mack , and the car out of dire straits . it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier . you see simon 's sister deborah ( tina lifford ) is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children , and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people . mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretary 's friend jane ( alfre woodard ) . this is the main plot of the film , but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above ( mary louise parker ) as well as mack 's wife , ( mary mcdonnel ) who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto ( jeremy sisto in his first movie role ) has gone to camp for the summer , and will likely be moving on with his own life soon . the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes . this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the story . the director lawrence kasdan , whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill , has created a splendid movie here . the cast is excellent , and most of the ideas are well thought out , but alas it falls short of greatness because some points , that would 've made the film even stronger , are glossed over . the story involving the secretary is one , and the second involving simon 's nephew is the other . these scenes should 've been more apart of the entire story , and then maybe lawrence kasdan 's views of life between the upper and lower classes would 've been more on a superior level instead of just very good . still grand canyon exceeded expectations , and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after . there is also a small role for steve martin as davis , a producer of violent films , who offers his own views on life , and has a small part to play in this movie 's ideas .
watching fire and ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year . it was n't at all a bad movie , certainly not average , but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional ( which , perhaps as based on frank miller 's comic book , was the right decision to go with ) . but its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat , with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings . while i would probably re-watch fire and ice before 300 again , they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being , naturally , that it 's frank frazetta , the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics , collaborating with director ralph bakshi , in what is n't typical hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans . what this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time ( it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their masters of the universe vhs tapes back in the day ) is the possible cons mentioned before and , maybe , that you will see something somewhat unique . fire and ice is n't even the only bakshi rotoscoped feature , but it 's possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made , and he and his team create a whole striking world that 's part pre-historic , part out-of-this-world fantastic , and part medieval , and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds , the skies and grounds . there 's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design ; bakshi went as far as to say it 's more frazetta than him . this may be true , but it does n't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we do n't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion ( my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide- how they rotoscoped that amazes me ) . i neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it . if you 're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a 'damsel ' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada , so suffice to say it 's about , well , fire against ice , with characters named nekron and darkwolf ( the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance ) and teegra ( the typical hottie who 's almost * too * perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure ) . what the plot does do , as an asset , is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action , the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle , like when the ogres are hunting after teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes . and per usual for bakshi , he conjures up some craziness ( if not quite his usual inspired lunacy ) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material . if you 've seen wizards , you 'll understand what i mean to a lesser extent . so , if you 're an animation buff , seek this out right away for some 'old-school ' ( i.e . 1980s ) action and incredible design . for everyone else , it 's ... good , not great , as i would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension , with some alterations , 300 .
i sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope . i did n't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter . but it absolutely did , and then some . first , i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon . at times it seemed that harris was channeling lennon . the resemblance was often uncanny , and he clearly studied lennon 's mannerisms and vocal inflections . aiden quinn was quite good as mccartney , also bearing a striking resemblance to macca , although he did occasionally trip over his scouse accent . this work of fiction was well-written and well-directed . it was pure fantasy , of course , but sometimes i felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion . the rooftop scene was especially moving , as mccartney told lennon what he had never heard as a child -- that he was worthy and important , and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents . i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band ! my one complaint would be this : i am not so sure that john was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life . he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely , and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans . only a few years later , he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered . mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer . i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage . and i am quite certain that lennon and mccartney would still be friends today . well done , vh1 . i will watch it again and again .
and i am a nicole kidman fanatic . i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book , which , for all i know , she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie . all four of the principals are excellent , but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing . while one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie , this one asks too much of the viewer . it could have been very funny ( which it is in parts ) or quite frightening ( which it is in one scene ) but the director did n't seem to know which way to go .
dirty harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them . probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has ... anyway ..... an action-packed story set again in san francisco and santa cruz . the chief rapist , played by andy drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end ( of course ! ) . not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original dirty harry .
critics need to review what they class as a quality movie . i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films . europa is a breath of fresh air , a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film . lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension . the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters , and the focus of the conversation they are having . other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene . the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect , again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions . i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own , and really heighten the drama of the film . a film to buy if you do n't own already and one to see if you have not . 10/10 do n't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors .
tho 35 years old , groove tube looks a lot like actual tv today ! specialty niche networks ( nude sports ) , a tv show about stoner drug dealers called the dealers ( ala weeds , and even predating 1978 's cheech & chong up in smoke ) , weird beer commercials ( butz beer , no less bizarre than bud bowls ) , dirty-minded kid 's clown koko ( shades of pee wee herman ) , even chevy chase doing slapstick humor ( a violent barbershop vocal duo ) a year before his 1975 debut on saturday night live . and thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned groove tube an initial x-rating , i still ca n't hear curtis mayfield 's `` move on up '' without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies -- -- for similar sketch-style movies , see tunnelvision , kentucky fried movie , amazon women on the mood , monty python 's beyond the fringe , dynamite chicken , and the firesign theatre 's everything you know is wrong .
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said ? well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks . how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know . im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was . however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real . and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me .
a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting . there are also some very innovatively shot scenes and good music , although the daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unfitting to the situation , although this is not a mayor problem . it also poses interesting questions about justness of revenge and limits of friendship .
this movie is awesome . sort of . it dosent really say much , or do much , but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is . the high school is taken over by evil ms.togar that hates the one thing that all the students love , rock & roll . riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show , and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle & the ramones . this movie has everything , a bad script , questionable directing , bad actors ( ie clint howard & p.j . soles ) , an awesome soundtrack , extreme campyness , these elements & much more come together to make this what it is , a classic . note - during the live ramones set , notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd . neat-o .
if you are a crispin glover fan , you must see this . if you are a sean penn fan , you must see this . if you are a movie fan in general , you must see this . if you have no idea who crispin glover is and you have no idea who sean penn is , this film will probably still have a lot of value , but the more work you 've previously seen by crispin or sean , the better . this movie is so funny , but it is also pure genius . there is nothing that i know of that resembles this film . it is its own genre . i doubt that anything like it will ever be made again . i can not say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it , and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that . in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review , i ask that you view the film again . in reality , there is no point at which this film could fairly be called `` boring . '' this is possibly the funniest , most entertaining , and least boring film ever made . and it only gets better with age and repeated viewings . a timeless classic that , unfortunately , very few will be able to claim to have seen . beaver trilogy is the brilliant work of director trent harris , also responsible for the amazing rubin and ed , which crispin glover also stars in . unfortunately , copies of this film are rare and hard to find . i managed to find a vhs version after some diligent searching though , and there are a couple of ways to find it that i know of . but i really wish someone would put this onto a dvd .
this film lingered and lingered at a small movie theater in town , and the word-of-mouth buzz got me to see it . a comedy about disabled people - the subject matter keeps lots of people away from a funny and heart-warming film .
fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley 's henry fool . i have n't seen the earlier film , and i do n't know if that 's a good thing or not . i can only regard the current film on its own merits . for most people , hal hartley 's style of film-making is something that you either like or you do n't . his combination of action , drama , absurdity and dry , ironic humour really resonates with me , and fay grim is no exception . it has an air of sharply-written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud . for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness . it 's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakes . during the second half of the film , the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage/conspiracy thriller . whether this was hartley 's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear , but i think a bit of editing or re-writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the film 's original momentum . the performances were generally good , particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum , who had the most screen time . saffron burrows , james urbaniak , carl montgomery and elina löwensohn all played good support roles . the film 's visuals were nice ( set in new york , paris , berlin and istanbul ) and the music ( also by hartley ) was good without being intrusive . the film is well-written and i enjoyed this it immensely . if you like hartley 's earlier work , you 'll probably like this .
the more i watch nicholas cage , the more i appreciate him as an actor . watching this movie now ( in 2005 ) , i can see that it does n't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s . i do n't really think it can be considered a film noir , but it is pretty dark at times , due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters . typical performances from each of the three main actors , who all did a good job with their roles . i thought , however , that hopper and boyle 's characters were left undeveloped , as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it . hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy . the plot is really good , and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic , there were parts where i had to hand it to the director ( i.e . when he first sees the sheriff ) . all in all , this movie is definitely worth watching . * * * 1/2
when john singleton is on , he 's * on * ! ! and this is one of his better films . not quite as tight as boyz-n-the-hood , but close to it ( and with much of the same stellar cast ) . this film was very well written , very well put together , and very well shot . there 's very little to criticize , and most of my complaints are superficial ( eg : where did fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff ? no mention of a rich background ... and why does n't professor phibbs have an office ? a professor of his stature * should * have one ... and while we 're at it , for an engineering student , hick or not , remy 's a pretty dumb character - i 'd think that he 'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon ) . but that aside , the film was very sharp . a good array of characters and points of view ; and singleton does n't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic , and he does a good job of interspersing the panthers and supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides . much of the cinematography was excellent ; i especially loved the scene where kirsty swanson gets intimate with taryn and wayne each scene spliced together really well . also the malik/deja scenes were really well shot as well . the dialogue was a bit much at times ; this film had a tendency to get * really * preachy at times , and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness ( we really did n't need the us flag with 'unlearn ' typed onto it , give some credit , we 're not morons ... ) . and to top it off , although * most * of the time singleton uses melodrama quite well , sometimes it gets * way * too cheezy ( like deja 's death , which is fine until she screams out 'why ! ! ! ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene ) . but the acting , in general , was top of the line . fabulous performances by omar epps ( perhaps the best i 've ever seen ) , kirsty swanson ( who knew buffy could act ? ? ) , michael rapaport ( surprised the hell out of me ... after true romance and beautiful girls i though he was a one-role actor ) , and of course ice cube and laurence fishburne are * always * outstanding . downside ? jennifer connelly was flat ; though it 's not completely her fault : her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional . generic to the highest degree . and tyra banks , who had the role , was nothing short of horrid . she whined and whined and whined . yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably ( though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule ) . finally , the soundtrack ! wow ! an amazing soundtrack ( which is definitely worth buying ! ) which fits the film like a glove . each scene has a twin song ( although the tori amos songs started to * really * annoy me by the end ... not her best work ) . liz phair , rage against the machine , ice cube ... how can one go wrong ? ? all in all : a really good watch , a really strong cast , great script , great film . 8/10 .
i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title , until one day i was scrolling through john candy 's film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named `` once upon a crime ... '' . something rang a bell and i clicked on it , and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories . i 've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a `` great '' comedy . it is , however , rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills . the movie has a large cast of characters , amongst them an american couple who find a woman 's dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival . from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers . kind of a mix between `` it 's a mad mad mad mad world '' and a lighter hitchcock feature , this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as john candy - to star in it . the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast , and the ending has a funny little twist that is n't totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected .
claire denis 's chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film . the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon , giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction . however , the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient . for example , a central theme in the story is young france 's inability to form strong relationships with others . although this portrayal is executed flawlessly , notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france 's return to her childhood home , the girl 's lack of intimacy with the film 's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development ( or lack thereof ) as a protagonist . the general stagnation of the film 's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot . the film raises a great deal of tension between characters , particularly between aimee and the men in her life , but never fully addresses this social friction , leaving the viewer unsatisfied . the final few scenes are powerful but depressing . denis 's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint , but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama , chocolat is definitely not the best choice .
i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther . having a baby sister .. you know how it is . by now i memorized both the plot and the lines . after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see ... the second one was significantly weaker ... then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1/2 ... i was like ok there we go again . after watching the 1 1/2 i was like wow . all my expectations ( for repetitevness ) were broken . a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time . i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100 % . i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon .
`` burning paradise '' is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo lam 's urban cynicism . when one watches the film , they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that does n't matter , it 's attitude and atmosphere that counts . this great film has both ! ! always trying to be different than his contemporaries , lam gives us to traditional heroes ( fong sai-yuk and hung shi-kwan ) and puts them in a `` raiders of the lost ark '' setting . however , these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie . instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results . what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime , there is no holding back . too bad , they do n't make films like this more often .
i ca n't believe how many people hate hal sparks ! he was my favorite host of the show , hands down . i hate celebrity gossip and generally dislike talk shows , but when hal sparks hosted talk soup , it was must see tv for me . i rarely missed an episode during his run , and was saddened when the guest hosts started pouring in ( although most of the guests still did a fine job ) . anyway , for all the people who dislike hal sparks , i imagine they must have never seen the weekend specials . they were hour long episodes of talk soup that comprised the best clips from the entire week , and were padded out by sketch comedy bits . the original bits that hal sparks did were hilarious . in one he got possessed by a bad comedy demon , and in an exorcist like scene his head spun as he told dated jokes about airline food . one episode was dedicated to making fun of multiplicity , as a bunch of cloned hal sparks kept multiplying through out the episode , over-running the studio . ok , maybe these do n't sound as funny when i describe them , but all i know is that besides talk soup , the only other two shows i watched consistently during those years was the simpsons and late night with conan o'brian . so if you like the comedy stylings of those shows , then you 'd probably like talk soup during the sparks years . that said , henson and tyler were both great hosts as well . all three hosts brought something different to the table but they were all fine comedians in my opinion . of course , throughout the tyler and guest star years , my interest in this show began to wane , but every now and then i catch the soup , the show 's spiritual successor , and sure enough , the new host can bring some pretty unexpected laughs from time to time . ok , i 've wasted enough time talking about a tv show that is n't on the air anymore and on a channel that i generally despise . go watch something else !
hlots was an outstanding series , its what nypd blue will never be , on hlots the plots are real , the dialog is real , the relationships are real . with hlots back as a movie , tying up all the loose ends , it was good to have all the gang back together , even a few that passed away show up ( wont say how ) the storyline was fast paced , emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out . homicide , life on the streets , network drama at its best ! ! ! ! 5 stars ! ! ! ! thumbs up and all that . thanks nbc for giving us the finally we did n't get !
please , future writers , producers , directors - learn from this movie ! never before have i seen such a bold and original tale created for the big movie screen . bold , because the script constantly made a step so many fantasy movies safely avoided - a step to something new , creative and daring . just when you think 'oh , i 've seen this before ' or ' i am sure this is what will happen now ' - stardust would make an unexpected twist and involve you more and more into the story . the actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such talent it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie . robert de niro is gorgeous and performs with such energy that he simply steals the show in each scene he 's in . michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch , and claire danes a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star ' , yvaine . other big names make outstanding roles . i had the filling everyone is trying to give his best for this movie . but once again , the story by neil gaiman , all the little things he 'invented ' for this universe - simply outstanding . i watched this movie at a pre-screening today , a day before the official release , and do hope it will have huge success . there is so much humor , but also tense moments as well as lovely tender scenes . the look in the eyes of yvaine , the 'frivolities ' of captain shakespeare , the passion of lamia the witch - impressive , unforgettable for me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 , watch it and enjoy it 11/10 - outstanding peace and love
so , neighbor was killing neighbor . reminds me of iraq . as i watched the american flag ( 50 stars in 1864 ? ) being dragged behind the horse , i realized why burning that piece of red white and blue does n't upset me as much as our destruction/indifference to the bill of rights . i 'm a southerner , and must have some historical memory . watching the tobey mcguire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave , as he looks at the scalps of blacks and germans ( his ethnic background ) being wagered at a poker game ..... was interesting . many twists in this movie . the wife , who is forced into her marriage , shows both lust and a strong will , characteristics we 're not used to seeing in 'respectable victorian southern belles ' . the crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin , head of the copeland horse-thieving gang , inc. in mississippi , was hung about that time . bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside , armed . remind you of iraq ? and how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background ? and why southerners are still fighting that civil war today . too bad we ca n't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we 've just invaded and are occupying , fomenting civil war everywhere . that 's mesopotamia , now called iraq , who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil . the wild-eyed killers in missouri , raiding lawrence , kansas could as easily be the insurgents we 're fighting now with no success . another anomaly was the father 's tribute to the yankees who move into lawrence and erect a school `` even before they erect a church . and for that reason , they 'll win . '' huh ? ? ? ? ? i was taught history in birmingham , al and we were taught that the north was much more industrial and richer ..... that 's why they won . course , they also literally had god on their side . as you see here , when the freed slave indicates that he 's cutting out to free his mother , sold into slavery in texas . god , what a horrible legacy slavery gave us . acting pretty good , lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle ( but did n't hear any rebel yells , so reminiscent of football games in alabama ) . you also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was , as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid . they have lost sight of why they 're fighting , and so do we . just more mindless slaughter . you 're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from iraq , as the bushwacker ( ahh , what connotations ) first has his arm seared shut , trying to save it , then has it amputated , and then dies . so much suffering for such a stupid cause . the cinematography is fantastic . now i have to get back to the dvd and get the production notes , one of my favorite parts of any movie . i suspect that this movie was written by a gore vidal , as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era , if you knew history . the dialogue is definitely thought-provoking . not your ordinary blood and guts war movie , by any means . you see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers , still fighting cause they have nothing else to do . you see the southern raiders , living off the land , stealing indiscriminately . yet , at the beginning , you 've seen the battle stop , so the women could be evacuated from danger . as i read the escalating number of women and children dying in iraq , i 'm thinking , `` where did we lose our sense of honor as a people ? '' i have forgotten why i sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years , but some book somewhere lauded it . with good reason . tobey at his best , pre-spideyman . buy the dvd or rent it . and tell me why others laud this , not just liberals cest moi .
the first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials . they focused on the sara good 's family . she is famous for cursing a priest which came true . in the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of ann putnam sara 's husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul . which does happen at the end of the movie . dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake . which never happen ann putnam saves her from the flames . the girl is safe she goes to ann putnam 's grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft , and lets her burn to death . now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed , and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials .
this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment . it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats , brat brothers , over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters . i 'm almost surprised it 's disney ! to its credit , ' 8 simple rules ' knows it 's a comedy and does n't try to be more . too many shows ( eg , 'sister , sister ' and 'lizzie mcguire ' ) think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting . this is a trap ' 8 simple rules ' has avoided ; it does tackle some issues ( such as being the school outcast ) but it has fun while doing so . in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character . and i think , although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark , ' 8 simple rules ' can still do well if it remembers its humour and does n't make cate 's father a second version of paul hennessy .
this would have to be one of the funniest tv sitcoms to come out of the states since the demise of `` everybody loves raymond '' . warburton is always hilarious , and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection . david spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines . after having raved over the british series , `` coupling '' i can see from just where the creators of `` rules of engagement '' got their original idea , but this is not intended as being a `` brickbat '' - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart . but it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series , particularly in the very difficult field of comedy . having been a part of a professional tv comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in australia , i can appreciate particularly , the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew . one of the few grievances i have with the series is the very obviously `` canned '' laughter . surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series .
i gave this a 10 out of 10 points . i love it so much . i am a child of the 80s and totally into heavy metal for many years . those are the reasons i like this movie so much . its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy ( judas priest , lizzy borden , raven , twisted sister ... ) and his vinyl collection ( unveiling the wicked by exciter , rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth ) . also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot . if you are into metal , then trick or treat is your friend . do n't buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds , watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory 80s . you will not be the same person after .
watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing . i was too young to watch it when it was originally released , and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago , but it has absolutely stood the test of time , and i have watched it several times since . everything about this film is brilliant , from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman ( even though i know this movie well , i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks , or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way ) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences . it 's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are n't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one . midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools . 10/10
i could not believe the low 5.6 rating on imdb about johnny dangerously at the moment i wrote this review and i thought i had to do something to promote that memorable piece of comedy as much as i can . seriously , to get a rating so low , the people who voted must have a very limited sense of humor , not to mention a very shallow opened mind . if you do n't like humorous flicks , do n't watch them ! combining absurd humour , a very good storytelling , and an outstanding pace given by the multiple running gags , this movie has made its way into my dvd collection . and that is without mentioning the visual farces embedded here and there and of course , the use of `` clin d'oeils '' and `` clichés '' based on our favorite organized crime movies . i showed this movie to a lot of people and , being introduced to it without any specific expectations ( except maybe watching a comedy ) - the very state of mind you should have to watch any movie in my opinion - they all liked it very much . it goes well , it 's not long to watch and there are absolutely no slowing downs in the evolution of the story , which i think is really straightforward . sure it 's not perfect , some gags fall a bit short , but no movie is perfect , especially when considering other opinions that yours . that is why i rated this movie 9 out of 10 . this movie is in my opinion a precursor like `` top secret '' and `` spaceballs '' in the field of absurd but well-thought comedies . which are nowadays more and more absurd while cutting down on the thought and ingeniosity side . sometimes gags need more culture than a lot of people imagine to be understood correctly , if at all . as a final word , i would like to say : watch it for yourself , do not follow average joe 's saying and if you do n't like it , then you 'll know for real it was not good for your tastes , which is understandable but unlikely in my opinion .
this movie surprised me in a good way . from the box i got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller , even though it was somewhat exciting . there 's a lot of nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and james belushi was born to do bill manucci , he does a great job . the rest of the cast ai n't half-bad either and especially timothy dalton is a treat . the story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film . things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things . if you do n't pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but i really liked it . louis morneau is n't all that well known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i never really grew impatient while watching the movie . made men is well worth checking out .
hey guys i 'm actually in this movie ! i did n't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised ! i played pete , the main characters son . it was a great experience and i loved every minute of it . while filming they needed me to be in two places at once , so they used my twin sister as a body double ! the finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine . i still act and do some tv , but not as much . oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll . review : i thought the movie was okay but if i was n't in it , it would n't be one of my favorites . i thought the acting was really good , but the story line was only so-so .
i ca n't remember many details about the show , but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes . unfortunately at the time we had no vcr , so i have n't ever seen the series again . however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on . sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days ( i think i was almost in love ) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day , mostly due to his appearance in the series . i would gladly buy/steal/download this series , i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone ... any ideas ? does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing ?
soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me . i wo n't tell you what its about , i 'm sure you already read the summary . this is a great doomed futureistic action/science fiction movie . kurt russell does n't say much , he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character . there are great action and fight scenes ; some of the scenes are unrealistic , but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives . i have not seen soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites . i 'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies ; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy/sci-fi movies .
first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd ! this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far ; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian . the cambodian ( edison aka pang ) goes around killing people to survive himself ; has done it throughout his entire life . sam lee 's ( wai ) duty is to capture the cambodian for good . there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it . the movie shows the struggles between those two characters ; they both beat each other like angry dogs . go and watch ppl ... strongly suggessted ! ! !

the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish . instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something , he uses his new-found invisibility to torment tom . and it 's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon . and the action never leaves the interior of the house , which is usually the trait of below average t & j shorts . still worth a 7/10 . however , i 'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall , it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself .
a fine western , following the fate of those who possess the prize winning gun , a winchester '73 . it has a great cast who give superb cliche characterisations with help from the usual effective story telling direction from mann .
vivah is in my book the best movie of 2006 ! period ! ! . in my book it is one of the best 100 movies ever made in bollywood . its sad that this movie does n't have that many reviews and is n't having that much popularity . vivah is once again a true achievement from a director who does it again . after hahk and maine pyar kiya sooraj has once again pulled off a brilliant one vivah . this is the most simple and cute movies that i 've seen this year . after seeing don 2 which was crap and later dhoom 2 which even beat don in that matter , i finally see a movie which is so close to my heart and my culture . i do n't know why bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture which we have and are making hollywood remake style crap movies like dhoom 2 and don . the story is beautiful and relates much to the indian system of arranged marriage which i too would like to be a part of . our system which teaches us to obey elders , follow them and of course obey their thoughts is so brilliantly shown in this movie ! . of course there is n't any force in choosing your life partner and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and its up to them to decide as it is brilliantly shown in this movie . coming back to the movie ..... vivah is a story of journey between the beautiful period of engagement and marriage . the phase where the guy meets the girl ! .... both understand each other .. both try to assess if they could love each other for seven generations ( as our system says ) and the various which occur during marriages . amrita rao is brilliant in the movie ....... shahid is ok ..... and alok nath and anupam kher are awesome ! ! the songs are brilliant . ! i especially like the hamari shaadi main hafte reh gye chaar and do anjaane ajnabi ...... overall a must see for anyone who still believes in the indian culture and tradition and i certainly do ! . go see this movie ...... i just have to say one word ....... bliss ! .
the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless . if you hate pregnant women , check out this movie because it 's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions . brooke adams stars as virginia . her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they ca n't have kids on their own . there they meet dr. meyerling ( james karen of rotld 1 & 2 ) . dr. meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant . ( insert joke here . ) is it because he 's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies ? that 's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment . that 's when she starts taking matters into her own hands . on this one , you 'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental queue too quickly . it 's a bit slow-moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third , all systems are go ! very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un-pc fetal violence . 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars .
this early version of the tale 'the student of prague ' was made in germany in 1913 , starring paul wegener ( who was also in 'the golem ' a few years later ) . in this film he plays a dual role ( technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot ) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he 's previously saved from drowning . moving at a fast pace ( the film runs just over an hour ) and fairly well written and characterised , 'the student of prague ' has echoes of the faust legend as well as dr jekyll and mr hyde , starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil , and developing into good and evil sides of the same person .
one thing i can say about this movie is well long , very long ! i actually recently purchased this movie a couple of months ago seeing that there was a new version coming out . i was happy to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70 's ( even though i never lived in them ) is actually one of my favourite decades , especially for the music ! when i watched this movie the story was actually very good at the start but then after about 50 mins it started to get very boring and repetitive . i will admitt the animation did impress me ! it was nothing i had ever seen before and was well pretty cool to see . but the movie honestly could of been a bit better , it could of had alot more talking and story to it than just 15 to 20 minute scenes that just had wierd fighting . then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie picked up and got good again but ended unexpectedly . in my opinion i thought it was extremely long . i know its 13 minutes over 2 hours and that is still long for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie , it made it seem like it was 4 hours long ! ! ! ! but overall it is an okay film i guess and i will watch it again on one of those `` nothing to do days '' . i will see the new one and i hope it is better !
i am a big fan of the movie , but not for the usual reasons . i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates , i think the sets were representative of the location and the era , i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band . however , i think the photography was amazing ! since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley 's had low ceilings -- perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a `` smoke-filled bar '' hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling . the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors , the bull , the bar , the women , the dancing , the low-level of light that actually was in the bar ! what a feat ! sure there was auxiliary lighting , but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar , it had to be low-light shots . ray villalobos ( the camera operator ) was outstanding ! he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film . thanks , ray -- great work !
while this movie wo n't go down in the annals of great cinema , it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family . the film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place . the film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named , `` the hungry bachelors club '' . jorja fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open . bill nunn plays a cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover . fox gives an understated and touching performance and nunn is reliably talented as always . micheal des barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney . the ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life . this is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family .
todd rohal is a mad genius . `` knuckleface jones '' , his third , and most fully realized , short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads . what the film is about at heart , and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this , is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration . or not . you just have to see for yourself . the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit , so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - you 'll be glad you did . it is hilarious . and check out todd 's other short films also popping up here and there from time to time : `` single spaced '' and `` slug 660 '' .
as someone who 's never been into sports , it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football ( or as we americans inexplicably call it , soccer ) -themed `` bend it like beckham '' . but i got ta say , this was one cool movie ! anglo-indian jesminder bhamra ( parminder nagra ) and her wasp friend juliette paxton ( keira knightley ) love to play football ( yes , i 'm going to say it the british - and international - way ) and just adore football player david beckham . but jesminder 's traditional sikh parents do n't approve ( her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie ) . okay , so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense , but you got ta love this movie ! and if like me , you go to this movie not knowing the definition of `` bend '' in football ... do n't worry , the movie explains it ( i 'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie ) . and we all know that keira knightley hit it big : a few months after `` bilb '' came out in the states , she starred in the equally cool `` pirates of the caribbean : the curse of the black pearl '' .
star wars : episode 4 . the best star wars ever . its the first movie i ever sean were the bad guys win and its a very good ending . it really had me wait hing for the next star wars because so match stuff comes along in this movie that you just got to find out more in the last one . whit al lot of movies i always get the feeling that it could be don bedder but not whit this one . and i will never ever forget the part were wader tels luke he is his father.way too cool . also love the bob feat figure a do hes a back ground player . if you never ever saw a star wars movie you go to she this one.its the best . thanks lucas
absolutely hilarious . john waters ' tribute to the people he loves most ( baltimoreans ) is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at . it 's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch ! i have n't laughed so much in a theater since serial mom . i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days , sharon nisep and susan lowe , back in front of waters ' camera . the cast is simply wonderful ( especially edward furlong and martha plimpton ) . uses the best elements of past waters atrocities ( especially the underrated polyester ) and plenty of new surprises . made me sick , in a wonderful way . thanks , john !
one of several musicals about sailors on leave , it is the usual sailor meets girl , complications ensue , sorted out happily kind of plot . it proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too . the dialogue is not as zippy as 'top hat ' for example and randolph scott seems out of place . there are compensations . it has some of irving berlin 's choicest songs including 'let yourself go ' , ' i 'm putting all my eggs in one basket ' and 'let 's face the music and dance ' . it has fred and ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they do n't disappoint here . they do a snappy tap dance , a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance , all in the same film ! great versatility and artistry . it also has harriet hilliard who is rather good in her role . she had a varied career , becoming the more famous harriet nelson with ozzie . here she is touching without being sentimental.her two songs are simply and effectively delivered . she makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film . more tightening up have made the film even better . pretty good though .
i had no problem with the film , which i thought was pretty good . it 's the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me . i wonder if lion 's gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place . sorry lion 's gate , this was an incredibly bad idea ! ! ! getting back to the film : the cast was excellent , especially val kilmer as the late john holmes . john holmes was a sleaze , mistreats the women in his life ( lisa kudrow as his wife , kate bosworth as his girlfriend ) , and he is hopelessly deep into drugs . his connection to eddie nash ( eric bogosian ) creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders . exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders ? we may never know the entire truth to the story ( nash is still alive and a free man ) , but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless .
this was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast . danny glover , tony danza , joseph gordon-levitt , and especially christopher lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the angels baseball team . you never know , it could happen . i loved lloyd 's role in it . he was hilarious . the story is about turning your life around , as the kid 's belief in angels helped turn around angry , hardened , and embittered manager glover see the best in people . the movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams . it was funny , charming , touching , and sad , all very nicely done . you will like ( or love ) it . i guarantee . * * * out of * * * *
this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in 1930s canada . i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as 'rudy ' and 'awakenings ' . it picks up late in grey owl 's life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential period . the film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over-trapped beaver . he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earth 's resources . this is an outrageous concept in the 1930s and surprisingly well received . he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listen . the casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd , but is not outrageous . anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand . brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau . galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond films . i would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama , beautiful scenery , or environmental causes . it is a movie for families as well , however children under 10 ( depending on maturity ) would have trouble following the plot .
i rented this movie and watched it 20 times before i took it back to the store . bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists . the story is original and well written . powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances . the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks 20 years back , then spots in the present , alternating back and forth . this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that ca n't get dull . bill paxton , please make more horror movies , you have the talent for it !
since educating rita , julie walters has been one of my role models , and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent . i would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress , but walters pulls it off with gusto and panache . adrian pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead .
tremendous black -- and-white nighttime cinematography , and plenty of it , highlights this supposedly-true life account of a 1950s murder in kansas in which an entire family was wiped out by two men . the story was written by truman capote , so you get the very liberal anti-death penalty message at the end of the film , which is ludicrous knowing the facts of this case . robert blake and scott wilson play the two atheist losers who have twisted outlooks on life and who unnecessarily murder this nice family . despite the annoying slant at the end , this is a riveting story from the start and the cinematography makes this even more fascinating . famed photographer conrad hall did a fantastic job on this . it makes me wish more modern-day films were made in black-and-white . see it on dvd . blake , wilson , john forsythe , jeff corey and the entire supporting cast are excellent in here . my third viewing of this film came in early april of 2005 , shortly after blake , in real life , was pronounced innocent in the murder trial of his wife . one ca n't help but look at blake and this film differently after that .
what happens to washed up rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990 's ? they launch a comeback / reunion tour . at least , that 's what the members of strange fruit , a ( fictional ) 70 's stadium rock group do . tony ( stephen rea ) has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival . it was at that festival in the 70 's that strange fruit broke up . the 70 's are `` retro '' and the time is right to wide that wave . he sets off in search of the other members of the band . part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of keith , the lead singer and brilliant song writer . the band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came . beano , the drummer , played by timothy spall ( who was brilliant in secrets and lies ) is a layabout , the bass player is a roofer , and their lead singer is still a rocker . while he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it , as his fortune has not lasted . brian , the lead guitarist , is dead , so a young guitarist is hired to replace him . somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try . abandoning their day jobs , they begin to rehearse , and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums . but he wants them to start touring again first . and so they hit the club circuit around europe . the club scene is not kind to these overweight , dated , old rockers . it is on tour that the film really starts to develop . all of the old conflicts rearise , with the figures of keith and brian hovering throughout . they all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier . and they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable . still crazy starts as spinal tap ii but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film , following the relationships of the band members . while it is still a very funny movie , it is the evolving characters , struggling to deal with the deaths of brian and keith and with their own personal demons , that make the film work .
i 'm a big fan of morgan freeman . 'the shawshank redemption ' ranks at the top of my all-time favorite movies . but i have to admit that i have often wondered about his choice of roles . so many of his titles were big budget clichés with no heart . '10 items or less ' for me marks the return of freeman to a role that truly showcases his considerable acting talents . freeman plays an unnamed , formerly big time hollywood actor who has n't worked in several years . he has been offered a part in an unspecified indi picture for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in la . after being stranded there by his flaky driver , freeman is offered a ride home by checkout girl scarlet ( paz vega ) , whom he has semi-befriended . before she can take him home , however , scarlet has a big job interview she needs to get to , and freeman agrees to tag along in exchange for the ride . the movie follows scarlet and freeman to several locations , but the movie is really just a character piece about the interactions between the two . freeman is the quintessential disconnected hollywood type who has n't heard of target , and does n't know his own telephone number or even what day of the week it is . he spouts wisdom from the dalai lama filtered thru his 'the whole world is but a stage ' mentality , and repeatedly calls scarlet 's job interview an 'audition ' . and yet he has a way with people , a way of affecting them that extends beyond his fame . he is a fan of humanity . he studies them , asks incessant questions about them , and delights in their quirks where others would simply be annoyed . in scarlet , he sees the stubborn , proud loner that he was ; he sees the man he used to be . scarlet , for her part , displays a fierce pride and sharp tongue that serve to hide her own insecurities about herself . vega plays the role with a connection to freeman that skates the line between an almost daughterly love and physical attraction , although she plays it beautifully and it 's not at all as creepy as it sounds . but even as she feels her connection to freeman grow , scarlet has a keen eye for the reality of their different worlds and cuts thru freeman 's hollywood bull * hit with a sharp pragmatism that refuses to accept anything but the truth . the movie is smart , funny , and well written , with dialogue that is simple but effective . i read one imdb review that said the lines were 'stilted ' , which i think is a misinterpretation of realistic human speech . there are no big soliloquies here , no deep soul searching moments . and so the trick is , i think , to show how people in ordinary , everyday life can forge connections with one another . and i think freeman and vega pull it off beautifully , painting a picture of a bond between two people that glitters like sun on the ocean , ethereal and elusive . long after it 's gone it lives on in your memories , tantalizing you with what might have been . ok , that was a bit flowery , but i really did like the performances and the movie . i would definitely recommend it .
the girl from missouri arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants : to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity . with her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon , but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love ? jean harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy . with her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments , she is a dazzler . but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress . she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood pantheon . an excellent cast gives harlow fine support : lionel barrymore as the wily old tycoon , wise to harlow 's ways ; handsome franchot tone as his son , smitten with love ; raucous patsy kelly , stealing her scenes as harlow 's sidekick ; debonair alan mowbray , as a well-mannered english lord ; elderly clara blandick as barrymore 's feisty secretary ; hearty hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies ; muscular nat pendleton as a lifeguard who catches kelly 's flirtatious eye ; and lewis stone , unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman . it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood 's production code was instituted . a comparison with red-headed woman , made two years earlier , would be fascinating - in which harlow 's character goes after the same ends , but uses very different means .
this was the best bonnie and clyde movie i have seen . it has more accurate accounts of what happened and while it doesnt glorify their crimes it casts the pair in a normal light . i give this movie a 10. it has great actors , realistic scenes and excellent writers .
boasting an all-star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the `` mad mad mad mad world '' of horror pictures , `` the sentinel '' ( 1977 ) is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress cristina raines . in this one , she plays a fashion model , alison parker , who moves into a brooklyn heights brownstone that is ( and i do n't think i 'm giving away too much at this late date ) very close to the gateway of hell . and as a tenant in this building , she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug , to put it mildly ! indeed , the scene in which alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying , and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers . despite many critics ' complaints regarding raines ' acting ability , i thought she was just fine , more than ably holding her own in scenes with ava gardner , burgess meredith , arthur kennedy , chris sarandon and eli wallach . the picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion , and although some plot points go unexplained , i was left feeling more than satisfied . as the book `` dvd delirium '' puts it , `` any movie with beverly d'angelo and sylvia miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards ca n't be all bad '' ! on a side note , yesterday i walked over to 10 montague terrace in brooklyn heights to take a look at the sentinel house . yes , it 's still there , and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest/nun at the top-floor window , looks much the same as it did in this picture . if this house really does sit atop the entrance to hell , i take it that hell is ... the brooklyn queens expressway . but we new yorkers have known that for some time !
generally speaking , the plot was much better than i was expecting . the laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way ; however , there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it . my biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers . spade , in particular , was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions , but his character comes across quite well in the pilot . there is is enough eye-candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them . now , if the writers can just live up to what they have begun .
this movie has everything you want from an action movie . explosions , shootouts , bad guys and worse guys . it is fun to see james belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss `` the skipper . does this sounds cheesy . of course it is . but boy , did i have fun watching this movie . it is a whole lot better than all the direct to dvd garbage that is made nowadays . if you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store . you could argue about the twists being predictable . but the fast pace of this movie does n't give you time too think too much of them , which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist . but more about the journey to that moment . only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie . they probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other . pure fun !
charles boyer is supposed to be spanish , and he 's come to london to buy coal in `` confidential agent , '' a 1945 film also starring lauren bacall , katina paxinou , peter lorre , dan seymour , and wanda hendrix . boyer is luis denard , and everyone is out to stop him except bacall . his papers are stolen , he 's accused of murder but he 's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the fascists . this film has its good and not so good points . it rates high for atmosphere and for suspense , and it is highly entertaining . bacall is incredibly beautiful , boyer is passionate , paxinou is mean , lorre is slimy , hendrix appropriately pathetic , and seymour outrageously wonderful . the not so good points : bacall is supposed to be english , and boyer spanish . uh , no . boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent , but bacall is 100 % american , not of the british upper class . the two have no chemistry . conclusion : bacall is somewhat miscast . her acting is n't up to snuff either ; she 's better in other films . but she 's an astonishing looking woman , and much can be forgiven . paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful . dan seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature . it 's a great part and his performance is perfect , while some of the direction of the other actors is n't as good . this was definitely a case of no small parts , only small actors . seymour was n't a small actor . definitely worth seeing even with its flaws .
written by the writer who penned the excellent murder rooms series which chronicled acd 's adventures with doctor joseph bell , i was looking forward to this and i was n't disappointed . it was quite slow moving , with a lot of emphasis on doyle 's frustration at sherlock holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed . it was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video , unusual for a period piece ) . the acting was excellent all round , particularly tim mcinnery and brian cox although the actor who portrayed acd , whose name i can not remember impressed me no end . an excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal sherlock holmes case . do see this if you get the chance
it 's a testament to gosha 's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece , goyokin , in the same year , 1969 . and it 's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public ( compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa ) , that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them . shintaro katsu is okada izo : mad dog killer , loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi , played by another genre stalwart , tatsuya nakadai . the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate . the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan 's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion . it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate , but it 's not essential by any means . the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well . as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years ( the late 60 's ) the visual palette is breathtaking , the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty . style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story . and speaking of story , hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada . as most chambara protagonists , izo finds himself in a moral double-bind , torn between giri ( obligation ) and ninjo ( natural impulse ) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is . in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self-advancement . lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat 's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer 's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan . the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes , the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self . it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a `` nameless '' drifter without past or future , torazo the vagrant . although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo 's mold , it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego , ambition and self-dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself . hitokiri ends ( which i wo n't reveal here ) in the best way any story can end : both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh , a last sardonic remark in the face of death .
my girlfriend and i have a thing for robots . so i try to seek out movies that have robots . and this movie has robots . big ones . they beat the clang and bang out of each other , with the fate of nations hanging in the balance . it 's really cool . you have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians were able to put on the screen while working with what was obviously a tight budget . it is very hard to dislike this movie . because of those big robots . they looked like transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers ! it made my girlfriend smile . and that is good enough for me . and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo : as the maniacal russian villain , whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they 've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste `` like blood '' ( a line he delivers with a deliciously campy sub-bela lugosi accent ) he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is on-screen . this is a nifty little flick that deserves its cult reputation .
this movie was so great ! i am a teenager , and i and my friends all love the series , so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds . i recommend it to everyone . my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says : `` rosy cheeks '' , when he is talking about his baby daughter . he is such a great actor , as well as erin cottrell . they pair up so well , and have such a great chemistry ! i really hope that they can work again together . they are such attractive people , and are very good actors . i have finally found movies that are good to watch . lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good , and show good morals , and christian values . but at the same time , these movies are n't cheesy .
beautiful story of wisconsin native , dan jansen , and his real life , agonizing struggle to win the 1994 olympic gold medal in speed skating , despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved best friend and family member ; his sister , jane . this story 's main focus is to sensitively portray the real life emotional turmoil of grief , that one feels in loosing a special loved one , and the struggle to productively cope and rise above the great loss ! it is the incredible story of dan jansen 's heartbreak in loosing his beloved sister to leukemia , his struggle to cope with the intensity of his grief , while still maintaining his dream to win at the olympics , and his ultimate triumph in winning the gold medal in speed skating for america , and in honor of his sister 's memory ; thereby fulfilling his childhood promise to jane ! after dan jansen 's remarkable gold medal performance in the winter olympic in lillihamer , norway , he established a foundation in 1994 to help fight leukemia , which claimed the life of his sister , and to support youth sports programs , educational and scholarship awards . his dan jansen foundation promotes the philosophy that : `` as his father always told him at a young age : 'there is more to life than skating around in circles !

more a snapshot of the most popular pinup of all time than your typical dragged out biopic , this fun and fabulous film has the look and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack and everything you would want in an indie-type film . i think the tendency would be to portray bettie page as some sort of sex vixen , like a jayne mansfield . but if you 've truly looked carefully at bettie 's poses , she always looked happy . not a `` you wish you could get with me '' haughty look , nor the `` i 'm just doing this because my acting career did n't work out '' look of a porn star . and so , the ladies involved with this film ( three female producers , a female writer/ director , female co-writer and the lovely gretchen mol , who i 'm sure helped shape this role with her own sugary influence ) really captured the idea of a sweet , somewhat naive , southern girl who really enjoyed having her photo taken and hoped that good ol ' jc would n't be too upset with her . gretchen mol turns out a career high performance ( she may just have the most perfect breasts ever ) , which i am happy about , because she did have the curse . several years ago , she made the cover of vanity fair when no one really knew who she was , touting her as the next it-girl . and let 's be frank , that was a bit presumptuous . i mean unfortunately she has never made it to gwyneth status , though not for lack of talent . making a few poor film choices when you are a pretty blonde in fickle hollywood renders you forgettable i 'm afraid . if this does n't put her back on the a-list , well i 'll be a monkey 's uncle . intensely private , bettie herself has not seen the film yet . bettie left the pinup party on a high note and fell in love with her old flame , jesus . whatever floats your boat honey . you were one helluva woman . i hope you 're happy wherever you are . congratulations mary harron , you 've done our cult idol justice .
2054 . paris is an escher drawing with people and vehicles scurrying along at multiple levels in an obvious homage to fritz lang 's metropolis . paris is both ultramodern and crumbling into decay . and in the blink between surveillance sweeps , a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after leaving her sister in a seedy nightclub . a tough police captain investigates . shown in stark black and white , with the gloomy corridors , shadowy alleys and single source lighting characteristic of the most hard-boiled of film noir , comparisons to sin city are inevitable . but the story owes more to masamune shirow and william gibson than to frank miller , as high tech surveillance , near-invisible stealth suits and ruthless super-corporations are as much a part of the landscape as guns and cars . the film never quite generates the doom-laden atmosphere of gibson 's cyberpunk vision , with its tech-heavy marginal characters clashing with industrial types from corporations that all seem to have their own ministry of fear , but the viewer definitely gets the sense that future paris is no utopia and future science is less than benevolent . and as the police procedural plot line unfolds we are taken into the darker recesses of individual ambition beneath the shiny veneer of avalon corporation 's cultivated pr image . the motion capture process used here produces a look somewhere between b & w comic books and next generation rotoscoping , and is either captivating or intrusive depending on your tastes . nevertheless , a great visual sense is on display here , and future paris is filled in down to the tiny details giving the picture a unique look which is in turns both spartan and baroque . worth a look .

homicide : the movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written , well-directed , and well-acted series . loose ends were tied up that were n't properly addressed at the end of the final season . the entire series , and especially the movie , provided a life-like look at life ( and death ) in baltimore , a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate . my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore , but once i experienced life here for myself , i realized how realistic it was . and the movie certainly retained that spirit . i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series , but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city .
i studied charlotte bronte 's novel in high school , and it left me with a stunning impression . here was a beautiful novel about a young woman 's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of victorian england . this young woman was jane eyre , a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own . her story , which bronte told through jane 's own eyes , was both sad and inspiring . as part of our study , we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story , and it blew me away . the mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to bronte 's original text and the essence of the story , but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great . both zelah clarke ( jane eyre ) and timothy dalton ( jane 's lover , by the name of rochester ) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters . i can not imagine anyone else in their roles . ( the other performances of rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion , energy , and tenderness needed to portray rochester accurately . i say that timothy dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of rochester . zelah clarke not only looks like jane eyre , but she captures jane 's quiet , but firm and passionate nature brilliantly . she holds in her emotions , like the jane of the book , at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in jane 's passionate scenes . the chemistry that clarke and dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to jane and rochester 's devoted relationship . ) as well , the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly , and the sets fit the gothic nature of the story . i strongly recommend this version of the classic bronte tale . if you have not read the book before , then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story .
this one is quite a nice surprise . cute little story of the heroine 's quest , very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen . visually a sight for sore eyes , not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for ( most of ) the costumes and make-up of the actors . an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation . back to the positives : the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core . loved that scene with the icicles , absolute classics potential . a slight minus only for ( very ) few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief . 9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect .
excellent story about teenagers , leaders , high school football `` stars '' . how far will you go to protect your friends ? lie , kill ? how much can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl ? can love beat the odds ? can you defeat narrow-minded small town people ? when your friend scores and you `` lose '' , will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it , or will you be a man about it , and respect her right to chose ? will you rape her and show it as your victory over a `` problem '' girl ? can you stand by the one who 's only sin is to have an opinion of her own , to be able to make her own decisions , to chose for herself ? it made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong , but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general . thumb up !
in his directorial debut , denzel washington takes a true story that also happens to be a very difficult story and brings it to the screen with an honesty that we have come to expect from washington 's acting efforts , but now we see this touch as a director . recently we have seen some of the disastrous results of kids who have fallen through the cracks of public protection . this story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end . we can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power can not be understated . if the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty . this film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does n't transcend from a novel to the screen . this , of course , is a tribute to the director . this is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too !
this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie . the acting is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding . the gore is well done and used sparingly ( look out for the excellent barbed-wire death ) & the action is punchy when used . it 's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times , but compared to other movies on the same ( or bigger ! ) budget , it 's hardly noticeable at all . overall , this is recommended . trust me , it 's better than it appears ! 8/10
`` foxes '' is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s . and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it ( porky 's , fast times at ridgement high ) , the movie holds up well against time . its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and jodie foster and sk8er boi scott baio ( remember him ? ) lead a fine young cast that 's well worth watching . the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents . the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties , concerts , or out on the street . seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill , party , or boy away . but rather than condemning them , the film is sympathetic , blaming absent , uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone . and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike . the film 's opening  a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows . we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood , from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola , while donna summer 's `` on the radio '' is scored beneath . from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life . annie ( runaway rocker cherie currie ) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill . deirdre ( kandice stroh ) is the boy crazy drama queen . madge ( marlilyn stroh ) is the shy girl in over her head . and foster is the one with the plan . it 's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line ( sally kellerman ) . it 's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at . despite its age , `` foxes '' remains a pleasure to watch . dated hair , clothes , and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill have n't hurt the movie . the cinematography is simply stunning , with breathtaking filtered shots of the l.a. basin at dawn , dusk and at night . giorgio moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian . perhaps the movie 's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of `` st. elmo 's fire '' ( 1985 ) or `` empire records '' ( 1995 ) . `` foxes '' shows why they should have . but perhaps like bowling for soup 's song `` 1985 , '' they just hit a wall .
i first saw this movie when it was released in the u.s. in 1984 . i have seen it many , many times since . what strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa . throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal . this continues up to the climax of the film . all these years later my friends and i still love to debate whether or not `` carmen '' is really stabbed at the end . from the reactions of the other characters , to the stylized murder , it is open to debate . the passion of the dance , the quality of the acting , the love of art , and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that , once again , blends and twists the line between life and art .
i 've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too . some of the users are stuck in a 'realist ' type of mentality . this film was meant to be a 'fantasy ' .... a 'what if ' fun film . it was never meant to be 'real ' or serious . it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the challenger explosion ... i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one - my young son loved it too ! later , i shared it with my daughter and she , too , loved it . spacecamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that - fun . all the 'realists ' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film . so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real spacecamp ( one in alabama and one at vandenberg afb in california ) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown ' ... i guess their parents did n't explain the difference between fantasy and reality . oh well . if you love fantasy-fun films and have n't seen this one , i highly recommend it ! enjoy !
`` cypher '' is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future . while thematically not complex , this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty , ruthlessness , and corporate conspiracy . to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf . the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man , morgan sullivan ( jeremy northam ) , who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative . after an initial briefing with digicorp 's security chief , sullivan is then given a new identity ( jack thursby ) and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies . upon successfully completing his first assignment , sullivan/thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered . however , on one of his `` business trips '' he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster , ( liu ) whom he had met on his previous assignment , and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy . the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp 's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp 's main competitors , thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies . ( ( spoilers end here ) ) what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes . vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings , while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up . i was also very impressed with jeremy northam . not too often have i seen him in the lead role , and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant . personally , i think he 's one of the many under used actors in the industry who has n't been given more challenging roles . lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone . additionally , the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job , however , my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated . for example , i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second `` wife . '' overall , this is a cleverly developed cloak-and-dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted . with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work , this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future . i 'm surprised that i had never watched this `` hidden gem '' before . this is a brilliant , not-too-overly complicated spy thriller , and therefore i 'm giving it a 9 out of 10 .
this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all . generally speaking , i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories . and this one is great ! besides meryl 's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise , the movie 's greatest asset is the story it is based on . the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture , after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans , and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society . it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people ( the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example ) are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would , for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices , shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions . the other face of the so-called `` civilized '' society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings ( needless to say , this is very general , even though this specific tale unfolds in australia ) , that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty . must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking .
white fire was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate dvd releases and on vhs . he claimed it 's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made . i generally do n't watch movies knowing that they 're going to be bad , but i made an exception for this one ... and i was very glad that i did . it 's filled to the brim with action ( much of it surprisingly , graphically gory ) , sleaze ( isolated to nudity with a key female character , but there 's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious ) and outrageously awkward dialogue , all of which adds to the laughter-inducing tone of the film . ginty , the unusual looking star of the exterminator ( and countless other low budget action turds ) is amusing in the lead , giving the best performance he could muster . williamson is better than usual , clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee ( and he does n't come in until midway through ) . the rest of the cast is also fun to watch , particularly the villains , one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish-mash of spanish and italian . she 's priceless . again , i ca n't stress enough how gory it was . it 's not so bloody that it 's nauseating , but it 's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget . also , when ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys , he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers . do n't miss white fire . it 's a rollicking - if mind-numbingly stupid - action classic .
this film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind . first , the central father-son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his wong fei hung film `` drunken master '' ( ideas from this film recur in `` drunken master ii ) , and not `` young master '' ; that chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly ; and , indeed , the film conveys a sense of being incomplete ; for instance , the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film . `` young master '' , from the same period , also feels underdone , but at least all its central threads are tied together at the end . this film feels as though chan wrestled with the plot and characters trying to find his central theme , only to abandon the effort , possibly due to time and budget . or perhaps the film is simply over-ambitious . this is an important turning point film in chan 's career , because he commits himself to development of the central character above all other concerns - which is why there 's such a lack of kung fu throughout the film . chan wants to make an historical romantic comedy that just happens to have kung fu in it . but both the historical element and the romantic element come across as little more than plot-twists . that leaves us with the comedy . since chan 's concern is character-development , the comedy is largely character driven - as in the conflict between chan 's character and his best friend , an argument over a girl . but there 's plenty of slapstick as well . frankly , i find the comedy amusing enough to forgive the incompleteness of the plot . this film represents an effort on chan 's part to find a viable formula that he can use and develop over time . it does n't quite work , and chan would only find that formula after abandoning the historical elements of his earlier films , with the making of the contemporary action comedy `` police story '' . but going back to view this film is still very informative as to how chan worked his way through the historical genre , and perhaps why he abandoned it .
a toothsome little potboiler whose 65-minute length does n't seem a second too short , my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem -- hitchcock 's the lady vanishes is one example . out-of-work julia ross ( nina foch ) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london , whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend . after reporting to duty , she wakes up ( having been drugged ) in a vast manderley-like pile on the cornish coast , supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of george macready , who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks . his doting , enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty ( this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good-vs-evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes ) . the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically ; we know what 's going on but are powerless to tell poor julia . this movie , curiously , is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest ( and very few british ) films noirs . i think it 's closer to the gothic old-dark-house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption ; it does , however , evince a more modern , psychoanalytic cast of mind . whatever you call it , it remains a sharply satisfying thriller .
ride with the devil directed by ang lee ( crouching tiger ) is another gem in this fine directors cap . for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war . see this film & you will visit a sad piece of americana . besides some superb action scenes ( quite bloody at times ) . this is a story of love & devotion between men & one lady in particular . it stars toby maguire , skeet ulrich jeffrey wright & as the young lady jewel , i never heard or seen her before , i want to see more of her ) .the acting is top notch , superb production values , very well written ( adapted from a novel ) this is a long film 128 minutes , but well worth seeing . my rating is * * * * respectively submitted jay harris
the basic storyline here is , aditiya ( kumar ) is the spoilt son of a millionaire , ishwar ( bachan ) who owns a toy industry , in ishwar 's eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong , aditya 's mother sumitra ( shefali shah ) warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late , for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live , when his son elopes and marries mitali ( chopra ) , ishwar readily forgives aditya , but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon , mitali is pregnant , and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible , aditya does n't know his father is suffering from lung cancer , and he also does n't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible , ishwar can not bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die , with a hungry and pregnant wife . it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father , and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die . this movie is absolutely brilliant , this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry , shah 's directing is almost flawless , but which movie does n't have flaws ? the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker . the song interludes is just placed at the right time , the scenery is good , the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying , but overall this is a brilliant movie , i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews . 9/10
i remember this show from swedish television . i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief . i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed . although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 : s and the political climate of the 70 : s. when i think of it , this was a real sci-fi , a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . the term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them .
this comment does contain spoilers ! ! there are few actors that have an intangible to them . that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma , panache and swagger . it 's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great . i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson . you can look at clooney 's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good-bye to andy garcia in ocean 's 11 when they just utter each other 's name disdainfully . `` terry . '' `` danny . '' you can pick any number of jack 's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene . these guys just have it . you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does . if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee 's film of the same name , you can see that there is no finer an actor working today . i do n't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel 's work , but he is definitely the cog of the production . i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw , emotional and incendiary all at the same time . washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives . he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led . he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man . his friend and perhaps mentor , played very reservedly by christopher walken , is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich . apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s.e.a.l.s and such can do very well while providing a needed service . creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty . marc anthony is fine as samuel , radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita . i do n't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy . the film 's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role , perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly . but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role . it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema . together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them . tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better . i am interested to see how his next film , domino , turns out . i think scott is one of today 's under rated directors and with more films like this one , his name will surely be elevated to icon status . the story has creasy really taking to pita , and vis-ca versa . there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad , he is not around much . he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family . soon , creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition . he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear `` creasy '' . it 's not just a friendship between them , it is more of a kinship , and a deep parental love seems to be present . the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her . this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion . and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force . like i said earlier , i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day , but never have i seen him like this . he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead , he becomes a literal man on fire . it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance . denzel 's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita 's violation . this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind . also what is paramount to this film 's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance . i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily . they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die . but not in this film . writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful . the perpetrators here feel creasy 's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes . there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice . he needs information and someone loses a finger . he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things . there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film . man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 . now that it is out on dvd , my recommendation is to get the se . it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks . 10/10
this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid . the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school . i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained . sure , some things are simplified but most of it was correct ( even though it was made 22 years ago ! ) and quite understandable . i would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it . it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example . now i 'm in my 7th semester and i think i 'll watch the series once again as soon as i 've bought the dvd-box : - )
this is arguably john thaw 's finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen . this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the outbreak of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child . however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story . it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy evacuated from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop - a real grandfather/grandson connection . it is a pity that this story was n't made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen , not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon . given the right guidance , john thaw would be celebrated the world over and bestowed with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie . a great actor and a great role that should have been honored more than it was at the time .
10 items or less was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director brad silberling , just a little film shot in carson , ca that feels like the entire story was improvised ... in the best sense of the word . silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor morgan freeman , in between his big projects , with spanish actress paz vega , and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other . morgan freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years , scouting a location for a little 'filler film ' to get back into the flow of things . his 'role ' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in carson where he encounters , among others , one scarlet , the girl at the argumentative 10 items or less checkout line . not only is scarlet tired of her static job , she is also generally angry about her philandering husband ( bobby cannavale ) , currently sleeping with scarlet 's lazy co-worker ( anne dudek ) , and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere . the two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip ' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other . it is a simple story , simply told , but because of the tender bonding between freeman and paz it works very well . this is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message . it is well worth viewing , and this is a dvd that has featurettes that are touching , informative , and comic - a pleasure to view . grady harp
audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching : a full-fledged , beautiful full-length technicolor film . i ca n't say for sure , but this might have been the first one ( 3-strip ) . at any rate , it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd . in fact , just how good it looks is amazing . kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski , director of photography virgil miller , selznick international pictures and , for the dvd - mgm home entertainment . all of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age . i thought the story was so-so : excellent in the first half , stagnant in the second . it gave a nice message in the end , even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it . i ca n't say more without spoiling things . marlene dietrich never looked better , i do n't believe , and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character ( `` domini enfilden '' ) . heart-throb charles boyer was the male star and domini 's object of affection , but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me . people like joseph schildkraut as `` batouch ; '' john carradine as `` the sand diviner ; '' the most memorable , to me at least , was the dancer `` irena , '' played by tilly losch . wow , there is a face and a dance you wo n't soon forget ! i 've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i 've viewed . just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd . looking at her imdb resume , she was only in four movies , but they were all well-known films . basil rathbone , the actor who really became famous for playing `` sherlock holmes , '' also is in here as is c. aubrey smith , another famous british actor of his day . schildkraut , by the way , will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit , `` the shop around the corner , '' with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan . the beautiful direction , photography and color , and tilly 's dance , are the things i 'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one . had the last half hour been better - although i admire the ending - i would have rated it even higher . it 's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection .
in the hands of a more skilled director , this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece . despite michael `` death wish '' winner 's merely passable direction , the movie is interesting , original and more than a little scary . the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back ( several it ca n't shake ) including chris sarandon as the heroine 's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down . burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor . eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d'angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover . john carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair . and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown-at-the-time chris walken ! this movie is creepy and creative . the plot twists are lovely , if a tad predictable . the climax , of which i will give no detail , is disturbing and quite impressive . again a better director could have done more with it , nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror . if you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy , you wo n't like this . there is almost no gore . the direction is quite spartan . the effects are few , although there 's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually is n't makeup ... but perhaps i 've said too much already . i 've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify , but i enjoyed it as much as any `` 8 '' film that i 've seen .
pufnstuf is what it is . i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond , and vivid , memories of it . seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where jimmy 's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel ( cass ) sneers `` i knew she had brown roots ! '' . it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time , and in some ways quite progressive . the track different , for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself , not running with the pack , and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different . this could be an anthem to the gay community , it should be , great track . martha raye , cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches , and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits ( includes billy barty , felix silla and other famous names ) . there is a lot of over acting in this film - there 's really nothing subtle , and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it 's really little more than yelling . this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel . while i think of it - i never could stand the flute though . i love the soundtrack , especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world , pufnstuf and even jack wild 's touching if i could . what 's more , it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london . see here for more : www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show , laughing our butts off ! i 've only seen about 10 episodes , and i am disappointed that i did n't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled ! the story line is very funny , the characters really have great personalities ( or , not so great , but they 're still funny ! ) . i tivo every episode of what i like about you . amanda bynes and jennie garth , as well as all of the cast , never leave me bored while watching ! there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content , but with a parental guide near , you should n't have too much problems . there is some sort of 'friends ' type of relationship that attracts me to this show . i really enjoy it .
i loved this movie . the scenery was breathtaking , the plot had some nice twists and turns , and the characters were well rounded . on two fronts , however , `` rob roy '' scored far above average . first , i have rarely seen a `` popular '' film in which the quality of dialogue was so high . there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay . i could give numerous examples , but why should i ? just watch the film . second , this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more . for a drama to succeed , it needs not only a hero , but a really believable villain . if you do n't have one , there 's not much joy in rooting for the good guys . and `` rob roy '' has not one , but three -- the earl of montrose , his henchman kilairn , and archie . not one-dimensional villains , either , but fully fleshed and very nasty . it takes a bit more patience than `` braveheart '' -- there 's more dialogue , and the accents are a bit tough , but it 's a much more clever and subtle piece . ( as i said , i loved this movie ! )
while i do not think this was a perfect 10 , i do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it 's rated here . no , brokedown palace was not perfect and yes it 's plot has been done many times before . that does n't mean it should n't be done again if it is done well and i think this movie had some strong moments . the acting of claire danes , as already mentioned many times , was flawless as was kate beckinsell and i think bill pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances ( pullman 's wife , the crooked cop , skip or trip or whatever his name is ) . the cinematography was also beautifully filmed , there was a lot that 's good to this movie even if there were some negatives ( three major ones that i found ) as well . here is what i did n't like about it-the friendship between the girls-in fact , the girls ' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic . it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then , because , despite the positives , more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested , were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film . that , however , is not my major problem . and warning-spoiler alert . the ending as mentioned dozens of times already , was awful . it was awful in two respects . firstly , even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood , i wanted a happy ending ! yes , it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this , there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that . i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or , barring that , at least the cop should have got what was coming to him . i mean nothing happens to the bad guys , they all get away with it . very disturbing . also , i do not understand the ambiguity of the ending . i understand endings that are inspired to make one think , but this was not a mystery or `` clue '' type movie we were watching , and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened , who was guilty etc , with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel , i did not want to be kept guessing . still , there was a lot to like about this movie , and the acting is definitely at the top of the list , i would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look .
princess tam tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the united states , but there are more subtle ( to the american viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . pay attention to alwina 's ( baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a `` savage '' african , and ask yourself if alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . i do n't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention , the dichotomy between `` eastern '' and `` western '' culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . the french have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( see chris marker 's les statues meurent aussi- 1953 ) , and pay attention to the places the european travelers visit while they are in africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the `` other '' . i give this film a 7 because i am a sucker for baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like princes tam tam , that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( i am gushing , sorry . ) however the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .
i love old burt reynolds movies . they 're funnier and better than every other movie combined . they might as well have stopped making movies after `` cannonball run 2 '' , but i guess how could they have known that there were n't going to be any more good ones ? man this movie 's good . burt reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot , and the luxuriant loni anderson is on hand , looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way . burt and loni , those were the days ! i used to have this magazine that had loni anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner . i sure loved that advertisement ! plus there 's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something stroker ace ( burty r. ) is doing , and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment ! i laughed so hard i almost passed away into the night ! if you can find this movie , rent it ! and then never watch another movie again , because i tell you right now : there 's no point .
this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience . the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim 's mind are arrogant . as a victim , i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya . i agree that this is an incredibly brave film . this looks at rape from a different , more realistic standpoint than any other movie i 've ever seen on the subject . the end did drag on a bit long , but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice , since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 % . it 's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to .
one of america 's most brilliant film directors was without question elia kazan . his directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers , since kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle . however , 'panic in the streets ' is a first-rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released . the themes of illegal immigrants , people-smuggling , imminent plagues , rapid transmission around the world of diseases ( a worried richard widmark says : ' i could be in any american city in ten hours and in africa tomorrow . ' ) , ethnic isolation and ghettoism are today 's concerns more than ever . this film features a spectacular film debut by jack palance , and a wonderful performance by barbara bel geddes , two casting strokes of genius . richard widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once , and is a deeply caring , warmly loving , intense hero of the people . he leads basically a one-man campaign to stop an epidemic of pneumonic plague in new orleans , struggling to convince sluggish politicians and complacent policemen that there is a problem . there is a race against time to find the small-time crooks who have contracted the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours , before the whole city , and as they are always reminding us , the whole country , are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu . one amazing scene where jack palance , who is infected , is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat-barrier on the rope is ironic in the extreme , reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst carriers and vermin of all . the highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee factory ' at the wharfs rivals the most inventive climax scenes of hitchcock , and with just as spectacular a setting . many non-professionals appear in the film , which has the gritty realism of , well , something called reality . kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went , and where even rats would have thought twice . this film was a major feat of social realism . if it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers , it is because kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up , for after all , the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and molls . the only unfortunate thing about the film is the title , which gives a false suggestion of superficiality . but kazan was anything but superficial . he clearly considered this project a public duty , to alert us to genuine possibilities . if only those possibilities had diminished today , but alas , they are getting worse every day . one day , after a worldwide plague , this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an outbreak was contained on film , but its lessons were forgotten .
audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out . the structure of the film really divorces from sap-happy hollywood conventionsas well as other major theatrical elements . it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light . films of this naturethe neo-realist filmswere made to reflect the darkness felt during post-world war ii times . ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war , including : adultery , conspiracy , murder , pregnancy , etc . aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments , the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty : shot on-location , uses natural lighting and most likely non-popular actors . all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film , yielding the following theme : negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally . the two leadsgino and giovannaare polar opposites , yet both carry the mentality : we 're bored and we want to be entertained . gino is a drifter ; a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations . giovanna is a bored house-wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence : she does n't want to leave her home and husband , but would rather remain where she is because it 's safer . gino 's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves ; the only difference is that she 's too afraid to live it herselfthat 's why she falls in love with gino : he represents everything she wants but does n't have the courage to get . she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husbandgino is the perfect ticket into that world . the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40 's feeling somewhat uneasy . i mean , films prior to the neo-realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before . to say the least it was probably a bit alarming . in conjunction with the theme , the neo-realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior . succinctly put , adulterous behavior ( as shown in the film ) leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives . when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to `` eliminate '' giovanna 's husband , karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done . they return to their home : the atmosphere is dark and biting ( as can be expected from the neo-realist style ) . they are not happy ; they 're actually more depressed . they thought that by eliminating giovanna 's husband that they 'd live happier lives , but they were duped . the film ends with giovanna 's deathit being in karmic similitude of her husband 's death . i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons . here 's why . there 's a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen , and if so , to what extent . i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified , but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have . as the subtext of ossessione asks , is adultery and murder evil ? i think the film eagerly responds yes ! the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are . ironically though , towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other 's arms inside the car , the author of the film shows that their happiness is , in fact , a façade : the car crashes off the cliff and into the river , killing giovanna ; the police arrest gino . i think it was the author 's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior , in the end karma will come back to haunt them . i agree . i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfishalways wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times . this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship : he ca n't handle the pressure of living in giovanna 's husband shadow , so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl . such is typical of the insatiable , hedonistic personality . all in all , the film seemed very risky for its time . the audience , however , was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought . those pre-war , happy-go-lucky films were no longer being believed . movie-going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters : they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so-called 'sin ' because it was a reflection of their own life problems . ossessione , then , acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading . that is , a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement .
i read somewhere ( in a fairly panning review ) that this is something of a live-action mecha anime , and i think they 're on the right lines . i first watched this movie when i was very young and i 've been dying to see it again , and when i finally did just recently all the memories came flooding back . i do n't think this is to be taken too seriously - it 's just a bit of good old 80 's almost-a-tv-movie fun ( it is set against the backdrop of a fairly dark future , although this point is n't stressed too much ) . what i admired most about this movie was that the dialogue did n't sound generic - no clichés , no predictable lines - all in all just good fun ! maybe time has n't been kind to this little movie , but still i can find appreciation for it in me . it 's by no means perfect , but it 's entertaining and does n't try to be anything other than that . let the nerds and comic-store-guys worry about technicalities - who cares ? see it for yourself and make your own decision . no-one else 's opinion matters .
yes this a b- grade horror . but at least the producers , directors , and cast does not pretend this flick is manna from heaven . the plot is corny , a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is splashed with genetic acid turning him into a snow man . the snowman a.k.a . jack frost then goes on a murdering rampage to find the small town sheriff that finally arrested him . with a limited budget the crew had to make do with limited special effects , most of the money appears to spent on the snowman 's costume . particullary difficult shots are managed by cartoons or pan away shots ( shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details ) . this is no kid 's movie and should not be confused with disney movie of the same title . if you do not let your children watch pg-13 movies alone than parents should not let their kids watch this movie . this movie has two claims to fame . 1 . the beatiful shannon elizabeth ( american pie ) did her first major movie role . the scene where jack frost attacks shannon elizabeth is worth watching a few times . 2 . this movie has the worst snowman joke ever . the joke is so bad that the directors credit the joke teller in the credit list .
im a huge m lillard fan that 's why i ended up watching this movie . honestly i doubt that if he was n't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent . a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming . it 's a low budget movie and some of the actors were n't really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10 . the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie . its a good rental ! 7/10
full marks for pacino 's rendering of the speech over the dead kid 's coffin ; shakespeare 's mark antony would be put to shame ! ! was it paul schrader or was it ken lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues ? they are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts . i found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice-over postscript . there is little else to talk about in this film ; even john cusack has done better roles than this one . interestingly , the film is very male oriented -- the women are mere appendages .
melvyn douglas and joan blondell co-star in `` the amazing mr. williams , '' a 1939 mystery/comedy that 's quite good , although forgotten , probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 . douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job , while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed . what happens in this film is no exception - he 's called to a murder scene just as he 's about to walk down the aisle yet again . both stars were excellent at comedy , worked together well ( and often ) , and help make this battle of the sexes fun . edward brophy and donald mcbride are on hand for excellent support . as you can read in other reviews , melvyn douglas does n't make much of a woman . entertaining if a little on the long side . one of the comments here trashed melvyn douglas , one of our greatest actors . he literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man . he was n't lazy , but rather , a very hard-working actor ( who made it look easy ) who had a broadway career simultaneously with his film career . he just was n't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system . i challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in `` hud '' and `` i never sang for my father '' and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .
what a movie ! i never imagined richard attenborough could have such a movie in him . gandhi has always left me indifferent , apart from ben kingsley 's performance , and i never considered attenborough a particularly good filmmaker . but cry freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times . it 's an exciting , mesmerizing political movie with great performances by kevin kline and a young denzel washington . kline plays donald woods , a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko . it starts as a difficult friendship , for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites . but biko , with his kind words , upbeat attitude and complete transparency , wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about . biko is a decent , law-abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people . one night , coming from an illegal meeting , he 's arrested and beaten to death . the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa . but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out . but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police . this movie has an interesting structure . it has in fact two narratives : first it narrates the life and death of biko . it 's an amazing first half , completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet . the second half , no less interesting , narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko . woods has become an enemy of state , a banned person , which means he ca n't meet people or leave his country . plus he 's constantly spied by the police . kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too . although the first half is quite straightforward , the second does interesting things with editing , by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans . some may argue this is to make it more interesting , but for me the second half just as captivating , as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa . the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears . george fenton and jonas gwangwa 's score certainly had something to do with it . although i 've never been much of a fan of fenton ( can not stand his gandhi score ) , i do think the score for cry freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema . the movie , thanks to the music married to the powerful images , at times reached incredible peaks of emotion . cry freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of denzel washington . this is a movie to be cherished in its entirety . acting , writing , music , editing , cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit . this movie deserve a place alongside movies like the pianist , life is beautiful and the shawshank redemption .
ooverall , the movie was fairly good , a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes , but chuck norris did hardly anything , except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters . the movie was very similar to the events of sept. 11 , with a bin laden-like terrorist sending a video to the president ( urich ) and threatening to detonate it . judson mills had some superb action roles , taking out rashid 's compound and various kick-butt roles but , there was a lack of chuck norris . judson took over most of the action , leaving joshua ( chuck ) with que on her computer . but , overall , it was realistic and did n't lack the action , but only did it on mr. norris ' part . i gave the film 7/10 .
i 've read one comment which labeled this film `` trash '' and `` a waste of time . '' i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit too much . i just rented the new criterion dvd 's of both yellow and blue . these films -- although hardly great -- have at least become of historical interest as to the so-called `` radical student political-social movement '' of the late '60s . i had n't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation , i was expecting some real porn ( there is n't any . ) there is frontal nudity ( including the still verboten frontal male nudity ( automatic nc-17 -- the orwellian-x ) in the u.s . but i was n't expecting the films in-your-face democratic socialist message . though it tends to the simplistic , i thought it occassionally made its points well . both films occassionally had me laughing out loud and the director 's commentary made it clear there was plenty of parody in the film . especially the supposedly `` pornographic '' sex scenes . the first such scene is very realistic . the lead couple is clumsy , inept , funny and endearing in their first copulation scene . the second -- which caused the most complaints -- has faked cunnilingus and fellatio . and the last is the end of an angry fight , that is believable . the extras include an informative introduction to the film , an interview with the original american distributor and his attorney , excerpts from trial testimony in the u.s. and a `` diary '' commentary by the director on some scenes . this is the film that `` blue noses '' would n't let alone and led to the pivotal `` prurient interest with no social redeeming value '' standard that , thankfully , still stands . those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must see .
there is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it . this takes the easiest and most shallow route , simply portraying him as a monster . only showing his negative sides , and exaggerating them . `` those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it '' . he was a human being . that may prove tough to some people to accept , but an important part of life is facing that which we do n't want to . rather than demonizing the man , we ought to try to understand him . otherwise , we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future , or possibly even the present , from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope , as far as damage and misery goes . hate him and what he did , do n't make him into something mythical , intentionally or otherwise . frankly , far too much of this mini-series could play `` dumb dumb * duuum * ! '' after or during scenes . the whole thing nods , nudges and winks at the audience , with a clear message of `` was this guy evil or what '' , incorporating every single bad trait ( as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was ) , letting them appear more or less out of nowhere , and having them be constant throughout his life , not something he came to believe or claimed to . this should never be used to educate . use der untergang ( downfall , in english ) , and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that , instead . this , this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place , and to any and all survivors , not to mention those who died . the cinematic quality ? top-notch . it 's well-done , through and through , excellent production values , a solid arc to the well-told plot , what characterization does occur is strong and credible , dialog and script are great , all acting performances are masterful ( carlyle looks and behaves the role ... as it was written ... perfectly ) , the music is well-composed , cinematography and editing are flawless and creative , and this is definitely dramatic , entertaining and riveting . they get dates and many occurrences , and do them justice . if i had been offered to work on this , and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person , i would have declined , citing that as the reason . i do n't blame anyone for loathing him . how can you forgive what he did , and are we sure that we should ? that is not what i am suggesting . finally , let me point out that , as i write this , we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years , and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929 . the two reasons it has n't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows : governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going , and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another . apart from that , the lesson had n't been learned . hopefully , it has now . back to this ... my suggestion ? read a book , non-fiction , dealing with the subject . there are plenty of informative , smart ones . the dvd holds a trailer . i recommend this only to those who know better , and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it , to seek out the truth . 8/10
this movie is actually funny ! if you 'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it . it 's called blonde and blonder , so do n't expect profound and meaningful jokes . what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes . it 's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends ( especially if you 're not too sober . lol ) pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks . it 's a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art . c'mon , this movie is about blondes ! it 's supposed to be light , funny and superficial . one more thing , i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will .
a year after losing gorgeous jane parker ( maureen o'sullivan ) to love rival tarzan , hunter harry holt ( neil hamilton ) returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe 's heart . mixing business with pleasure , he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment , tarzan 's stomping ground . accompanied by his slimy , womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers , harry finally arrives at his destination ( having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock-hurling apes ) only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller , and worse still , that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard . nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape-man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile . of course , tarzan is n't deadonly wounded ; after being nursed back to health by cheetah ( ! ) , he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion-eating savages who have attacked holt 's expedition . tarzan and his mate , the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words , is often cited by fans as the best of the series ; although i slightly prefer the original , i can definitely understand the film 's popularity : it 's damn sexy and there are some great action sequences ! the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o'sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes , and with both stars wearing eensy-weensy outfits throughout , there 's eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy ( despite o'sullivan 's much-touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double , the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin , even threatening to do a 'sharon stone ' at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side ! ) . the film 's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile , and the spectacular finalé where jane is attacked by lions and natives , but is rescued by her beau , his monkey pals , and a load of elephants in full-on lion-crushing mode ( once again , the violence is surprisingly nasty at times , although as far as i am concerned , there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film ) . cheetah also has his fair share of excitement , dodging rhinos , crocs , and big cats , riding on tarzan 's back as he crosses a river , and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride . like it 's predecessor , tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing propsdodgy back projection , a few laughable monkey suits , more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins , and poorly disguised trapeze swingsbut these should n't spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film . if anything , they make it even more fun ! 8.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 9 for imdb .
mild spoilers in the near future , arnold stars as ben richards , a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'the running man ' , a deadly tv game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'stalkers ' . of course , people are expected to die eventually and its up to arnold to prove the system wrong . i have n't read the stephen king book , but this is a great film regardless , one of arnold 's best . he does what he does best in the action man role , delivering death with unforgettable one-liners . classics are probably the 'he was a real pain in the neck ' after strangling a guy with barb wire , and 'he had to split ! ' , referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically . dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter , and all the 'stalkers ' are suitably camp . the action is violent , but its an action film . that 's the point . the film is fast paced , and at 90 minutes it does n't overstay its welcome . with starsky and hutch 's paul michael glaser at the helm , and made in the wake of the success of the terminator , previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for arnold , and very far fetched . but today , anyone who watches a lot of tv could see how the film is getting closer to reality . i would n't be surprised if i turn on the tv in the 'near future ' and see a show not to far from this . on that depressing note , i must however recommend 'the running man ' to anyone who likes the 80s , arnold , ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film . 9 . 5 / 10
the last time i saw the movie i was around seven years , so my opinions might be jaded over time . at the time i enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action . at the time i felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life . also i felt glee when after captain contagious kidnapped the heroine ( a princess or toy shepherdess ) the tables the were turned on him . unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to vhs , so all i have are twenty year old memories . i am sure that if i saw the movie again i would consider it corny and sappy , but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time .
the woman in black ( 1989 ) is a tv adaptation of susan hill 's modern classic ghost story , published only a few years earlier than the film was made . sadly , this film has not been released on dvd , and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs . it 's availability is in direct contrast to it 's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films . the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow , who died on her isolated marshland estate . what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death , and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest . the story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self-indulgent , flashy or over-expositional . the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach , but it 's just what the story needs , and why it works so well . it 's what you do n't see that scares . having said that , there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual , and it works to perfection . i watched this film during the day , and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later . if you love being terrified , do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black .
intelligent , stylish , and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films ! when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger , the victim 's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer . dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason . de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense . the finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.it 's a truly edge of your seat shocker . even more impressive though is de palma 's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own . dressed to kill is also a very erotic film , but mainly in a strangely beautiful way . pino donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film . the cast is another strong feature of this film . michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist . angie dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife . nancy allen 's performance as an involved street-walker is solid . a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son . many criticize de palma 's films for having hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception . but any similarities between hitchcocks works and de palmas can only be seen as a good quality , as calling this film a 'rip-off ' would be degrading to a fine thriller . dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans . * * * * out of * * * *
having been a fan of 'columbo ' , i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano ' . while certainly a funny movie , falk 's mob boss character was a far cry from the lovable lieutenant he 's played for so many years , especially with the offensive language he used . after 'corky romano ' , i was honestly both surprised by and soured on mr. peter falk . however , having just seen 'finding john christmas ' and its predecessor , ' a town without christmas ' , for the first time within a week of each other , i have to say that 'max ' , peter 's falk 's delightful character in both movies , is surely as memorable and lovable as 'columbo ' . while parts of the movie are quite predictable , such scenes in no way take away from the enjoyment of seeing the story played out . i too wish i had recorded both of these heartwarming christmas movies , and i highly recommend them whether you 're a falk fan , a christmas nut , or simply someone who enjoys the occasional feel-good movie of the week . this movie may end up lost among the throngs of made-for-tv holiday flicks , so be sure to find 'finding john christmas ' before it 's too late .
people criticise disney 's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy , set in landscapes that are much too pristine . that criticism is just . and yet it ca n't be the whole story , because the two least glossy - `` alice in wonderland '' and `` peter pan '' - are also the weakest . `` cinderella '' , on the other hand , set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles , is clearly the best . it does look good . the backgrounds are subtle and consistent ; the colours are pure without being too bright . the animation varies a bit . i 'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then , the rotoscoped humans ( including cinderella herself ) are n't full-blooded characters in the script , so this approach works well enough . it 's really the animals that make the movie . i think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before , as totems rather than sidekicks . the mice , for instance , are the creatures who draw us into the story ; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless cinderella . the cat , lucifer , is a kind of witch 's familiar to the wicked stepmother . ( the cat is brilliantly conceived and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time . the supervising animator was ward kimball and he modelled it on his own cat . i wonder how he put up with the animal . ) this approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story . their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story . among the supporting cast the notable humans are the king and the grand duke . the king is a one note character - he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion . the grand duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as cinderella does . ( although he , of course , is richer . ) `` cinderella '' is disney 's return to features after an eight-year hiatus , and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years . moreover he made things hard for himself by picking `` cinderella '' . she 's a passive heroine and there 's not much anyone can do about that . ( maybe i 'm wrong on this score - i have n't seen the recent `` ever after '' . ) nonetheless it is remarkable how successful disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life , without cutting across the grain of its spirit .
stories about the possibility of a post-apocalyptic future have been around for ages , since the very creation of science-fiction as a genre per se . the fact that today 's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow , and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories , whether they are good or bad . terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film . he gives the movie a decadent feel throughout , showing a society run ragged by its own excesses and bringing forth the a sense of imminent tragedy despite having moments of comedy . his world , the world in which twelve monkeys transpires , is a place where the mad run wild , where cities are collapsing in filth and neglect , where everything reeks of foreboding despite the luminosity of the opening sequence , where madness looms at every corner . this is a very dark movie , but his very best , most linear ( despite the plot twists which hold up under examination ) , and one which gets better with repeated viewings . a tragic event in which a deadly virus was unleashed onto humanity in 1996 and thus led to the extermination of life on the planet as we have known it leads to scientists of the future to try and make amends to change humanity 's fate on the earth by employing renegade citizens -- the scum of the earth -- as guinea pigs to go back in time , among them one james cole ( underplayed to great effect by bruce willis ) . cole could be any person . we do n't know anything about him , but in a way , that does n't matter since he is little more than one of many expendable volunteers and hints of his character sneak in later as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission . what we do know is that he is a man who dreams , and his dreams may have been reality : he may have already been at the scene of the event of 1996 . it 's this constant sense of deja vu that keeps popping up throughout the movie . when taken to a mental ward by mistake in 1990 he meets jeffrey goines ( spastically played by brad pitt , oscar-nominated here ) who frantically spews forth talk about doom and destruction , and later cole believes he has seen goines in his recurring dream as a man pushing a boy aside while escaping ... what ? he does n't know . later he meets a psychologist , kathryn railly ( madeleine stowe ) , and one of her first reactions to him is that he 's insane , and that she 's seen him before . this becomes a running notion throughout her participation in this story from passive/resistant to active and even slightly crazy believer that something terrible is coming this way , especially when she meets him six years later : she has seen cole before . at the same time , cole continues talking about a dream he keeps having in which she also plays a part as a blonde woman running down the aisle , screaming for help , after shots have rung out and a particular red-headed man in a ponytail ( jeffrey goines ? ) has apparently escaped , not before pushing the little boy who is an innocent bystander . the questions arise : have these events happened ? are they going to happen ? who is really a part of this , or better yet -- is everyone , down to the smallest player , a part of a greater plot ? or is this all some trick in the fabric of time in which time in itself is one huge conveyor belt showing repetitions of fragments of events that slide by over and over again ? these questions are formulated in a masterful sequence which includes key scenes of alfred hitchcock 's masterpiece vertigo in which madeleine elster/judy barton mourns her own brief existence ( `` you took no notice , '' she says , as cole and railly watch from their seats in the movie theatre they are hiding in ) . snippets of dialog from vertigo form a foil to the dialog between railly and cole and later , when cole awakens from having apparently dozed off in the theatre and goes looking for railly , he comes face-to-face with her in disguise ( looking almost exactly like eva maria saint from north by northwest ) as the swelling bernard herrmann score plays the emergence of judy barton , dressed as madeleine elster . it 's a fascinating sequence , more so because of the most improbable occurrence of the names of the actors in both films : madeleine stowe plays kathryn railly who dons a blond wig and grey trench-coat and calls herself `` judy simmons '' while helping an `` insane '' man named james cole ; james stewart plays a detective who tries to help `` insane '' madeleine elster who will later re-appear not once , but twice , first as brunette judy barton , and later , as madeleine . action and re-enaction , play and re-play .
this is not a bad film . it is not wildly funny , but it is interesting and entertaining . it has a few funny moments . cher gives a good performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self . her performance alone is worth the watch . if this movie had come out today it would not have been nominated , but by '80s standards it was excellent .
for the record , i am not affiliated with the production in any way . hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date . over 7 seasons ( this is the last ) they have produced some 50 or so episodes . this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy . by their own admission , the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects , green screen work and acting all improve . i did find it difficult to `` dip into '' so started from the beginning and watched all the way through . hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set . characters and `` relatives '' from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories , sometimes improving on the characters over the original . the whole experience includes an excellent web site , blooper reels , a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat . if you are looking for high definition , high budget productions , this is probably not for you . if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think , this is the one .
to me , the final scene , in which harris responds to the press corp , is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politics ( especially the campaign phase ) . if only the `` real-life '' pols would respond in the intelligent , articulate manner as did mr harris , then the arrogant , self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant , confrontational `` garbage '' that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which he/she is pursuing .
the title says it all . i 'm not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie . obviously this movie did n't have a multi-million dollar budget , but the plot was very well done , the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great ! it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie ! i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both , but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd . i 'll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films ! dylan o'leary , cast and crew , i thank you !
i liked this a lot . in fact , if i see it again ( and i plan to ) i just may love it . i 'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch . it starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it . you just get into it . i really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole . the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take . i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love . one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that . this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated ( even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is have n't seen this ) and it does n't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery , atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this . especially note worthy is that it takes place in south carolina so for those ( like me ) who love the south , and movies that take place there , this is a gem . i 'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick .
delirious , near plot-less mood piece and if it 's more lsd inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made ! after a startling sm opening ( which even itself is not what it seems ) we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering . lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised . beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold . a rare movie to languish within . old jess could make 'em when he tried . fine central performances too including the indomitable jack taylor and howard vernon . i have n't even mentioned the lisbon locations - ah !
the comparison to sleuth , the earlier stage-play-turned-film , is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better , but deathtrap has , at least for me , many more repeat viewings in it than sleuth . i purchased deathrap in the bargain bin at wal-mart , figuring that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks . it was one of the finest dvd purchases i could 've picked up . it 's one of those best-kept-secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover . and it 's totally worth repeat viewings . though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in bravado performances in sleuth , i was doubly impressed with christopher reeve as clifford anderson . reeve , rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman , stole the show in what should 've been an oscar worthy performance . i 've always felt reeve was a type-cast actor who did n't get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time , but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use , thank goodness . i absolutely relished michael caine 's performance . he was glib , deliciously manipulative and sadistic . and watching him work with reeve and dyan cannon was an absolute pleasure . in fact , it was thanks to this movie that i got into a `` michael caine phase '' and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible . as for deathtrap , there 's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its `` memorable quotes '' section . ( unfortunately , much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot ) . it 's really , really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own . needless to say , it 's a must-see . but for me , it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time . repeat viewings are a must . and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelf . i 'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film : `` i wonder if it would n't be ... well ... just a trifle starry-eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration ... where i could count on no sense of moral obligation ... whatsoever . ''
why did i enjoy the show to the last episode ? because of the true talent melissa joan hart and her supporting cast had of demonstrating that whit , comedy , light-hearted humor , and deep thought could actually coexist . what i enjoyed most was the fact that i could come home from a hard day 's work , and bust a smile ... i was inspired ... and why ? it was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy while helping others . sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... even though she was vulnerable in ways that were not so different from our own ... to very different ; she had powers at her fingertip , wishes , and command that could be used for good or bad which may only exist in many of our imaginations . most everything we see , have , know about , own , or even desire ... can be used for good or bad , and how we choose to define that , defines the person we are . she traveled the globe and other realms with these constant and unwaivering ideas in mind ... to learn , to live , to laugh , and to love . she was always learning how to improve her skills to the benefit of all around her ; she made mistakes as she was living life , going through different journey 's of growth , as she , her aunts , and salem ( the underrated , yet imperfect hero ) did well to demonstrate that even through mistakes , you can still be noble , gifted , and wonderful . she also demonstrated many selfless , learning , and loving acts as she went along her way . if this is n't reason enough for 10 stars in this war torn world where people are so hostile toward each other , not realizing how differences are the spice of life rather than a reason to kill ... then i do n't know what is . this show was most certainly a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better ourselves and a gift intended to bust a smile on our chops ... i 've heard from a doctor before that everything that i 've mentioned above leads to a healthy `` hart '' ... and is n't that what we all need ? : )
i just ca n't believe that these games can get so much better , but they do . unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it , but even though i did beat it i ca n't wait to buy it for ps2 . this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over . i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end .
i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is , i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it . i had fun watching this movie , perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be , i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there 's are things that i really found amazing , the way she manipulates people it 's just so divine . this is a very underrated movie , i lack of arguments here , i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it , when you go to the movies is to have fun , and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room . a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away . let 's try not be so critical about it . thank you for reading .
at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed . it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast . at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup . that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player . in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay . the city 's top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition . the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis 's henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat . but caprice 's moves are making him a target for tracy . in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself . will our hero sort out this thicket of crime ? the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious . when people like al pacino , dustin hoffman , paul sorvino , william forsythe , r.g . armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham , you 've got to love this film . al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor , but any of these guys could have , it 's only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time . only beatty plays it completely straight , the others all seem to play off of him . dick tracy won oscars for best art & set design , best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna , sooner or later . the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun . as for madonna , the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney . before this film , dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials . the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl . can you believe a cast like bing crosby , bob hope , frank sinatra , dinah shore , jimmy durante , judy garland , frank morgan , and the andrews sisters ? try and find a recording of that gem . until then warren beatty 's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely .
unremittingly bleak and depressing , the film evokes as well as could be desired the legendary misery and emptiness that characterised houellebecq 's controversial novel of the same name . like many french films , its manner is one of wistful profundity but it is painfully slow - or should that be , slowly painful ? while this is an excellent and challenging film , it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time when one might be in the 'right ' mood to see it .
this was incredible , meaning that it was hard to believe , that the `` forgotten tribe '' would make this astounding migration twice a year , and that the filmmakers , cooper and schoedsack , did n't stage some of the scenes and shots . but what shots they are ! the cinematography , under mostly extreme conditions , is brilliant , and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness . i had the pleasure of seeing this and `` kon tiki '' on the same weekend , which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be , whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science .
the title of this movie does n't make a lot of sense , until you see it in operation , because it 's the sound that a retarded young man makes while he 's operating his imaginary trolley , which is what he does all day . and he is just one of many odd characters in this surreal & at times , tragic tale of a group of slum-dwellers in japan . there are two drunks who trade wives , there 's a man with aspirations to be a architect , and his young son who he sends out to beg for food . there 's a wise old man who seems to be the pillar of sanity within all that goes on around him , and there 's a businessman with some severe nervous tics that has a wife that treats him ( and everyone else ) like dirt . there 's no particular plot to this , really , it 's a bunch of stories that drift back & forth between each other , sometimes funny , sometimes tragic . all in all i thought it worked pretty well , & i had been dying to see this for a long time just based on its description . i was not in the least disappointed , and i 'd definitely recommend this . 9 out of 10 .
i like peter sellers , most of the time . i had never seen him portray an upper-class brit until this movie . he pulls it off pretty well , although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix . it does n't get interesting until goldie hawn arrives . i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance . her timing was great and her expressions were priceless . the way she alternately shoots sellers lecherous character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch . verbal sparring like i 've seldom seen from a movie of that era . the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat . it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty . hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on . enjoy it ...
* * spoiler alert * * w. somerset maugham classic on film about a love obsessed young man who 's abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances . leslie howard plays the role of philip carey a sensitive young artiest in paris trying to make a living by selling his paintings . told by a local art expert that his work is not at all good enough to be sold to the art going public philip decides to go back to his native england and study medicine and become a physician in order to help others . philip being born with a club foot is very hypersensitive about his awkward condition and makes up for that by being a very pleasant and friendly person . one afternoon philip is at a local café with a fellow medical student and spots pretty waitress mildred rogers , bette davis , and immediately falls in love with her . mildred at first rebuffs the love-sick philip but later realizing just what a sap he is takes advantage of his feelings for her . mildred has him spend himself into poverty buying her gifts and taking her out to the theater every time she off from work . phlip also falls behind on his studies , by paying so much attention towards mildred , at the medical university and fails his final exams . going into hock buying an engagement ring for mildred in an attempt to ask for her hand in marriage the cold hearted mildred tells the startled philip that she 's already engaged to be married to emil miller , alan hale . it turns out that he 's one of the customers at the café that she 's always flirting with . philip broke and heart-sick slowly get his life back together and later retakes his medical exam and passes it and at the same time finds a new love in nora , fay johnson , a writer for a local love magazine . later to philip 's shock and surprise mildred walks back into his life . mildred telling philip that her husband emil , who 's child she 's carrying , threw her out of the house has the kind and understanding philip take her back at the expense of nora who was very much in love with him . it later turns out that mildred was n't married to emil but had a child out of wedlock by having an illicit affair with him ! emil it turns out was already married . as before mildred takes advantage of philip 's kind heart for her and her baby daughter , where he supports them with food medical attention and shelter , to the point where he again goes broke and ca n't continue his studies ending with her leaving philip ; after having a very heated and emotional encounter with him . out on the streets with nowhere to go philip is taken in by mr. athanly , reginald owens , who he once treated at the hospital and falls in love with his daughter sally , frances dee . later philip has his club foot corrected at the medical center and with the help of mr. athenly gets back to being a doctor . it 's then when he encounters mildred again who 's really at the end of her rope . dying of tuberculosis and having lost her daughter she 's all alone with no one to look after her . philip now well to do and respected in medical circles does all he can to help the sick and poor mildred but in the end she succumbed to her illness and passes away . mildred had the love and devotion in philip all those years that he was in love with her but choose to abuse him and have affairs with man who were just like her , cold unfeeling and selfish . in the end mildred got back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive philip : she became both unloved and alone . philip found in the sweet and caring sally everything that mildred was n't and in the end also found the true love that he was looking for all of his life .
the movie was very sweet and heartwarming ! i cry almost every time i watch the movie . i would recommend this movie for every one . the movie was so inspiring to me . the actors did a great job of acting , and the movie was very well played and done . the movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named paulie . paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her . after paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement . finally this russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor . had found paulie in the basement and paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life . in the end the man helped paulie reunite with marie ( the little girl who raised paulie ) . love overcame all the obstacles .
bottom line - best romantic comedy ever . this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for : the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race . when i am blue , this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh ( and that is still true after many viewings - always fresh ) . all of the actors are in top form . the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor ( usually difficult to do with matthau , robbins and ryan ) . the supporting cast is consistently brilliant : fry ( `` agae '' , `` a total pygmy package '' ! ) , jacoby & saks & maher ( the three theoretical physicists as `` greek chorus '' - `` but time does n't exist '' ) , durning ( `` something we can launch from nj '' ) , shalhoub & whaley ( robbins ' boss and co-worker at the service station ) , and curits ( eisenhower - how many comedies have eisenhower ? ? ) . do n't miss this overlooked treasure .
in this truly fascinating , dark film , a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money , in return the devil takes his mirror image ( this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when balduin , the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror ) , a visual metaphor for a `` man at war with himself '' which portents his immediate future . the student enjoys his money , but the woman he loves is unattainable ( he has made a pact with the devil , he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul ) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money , you can not have both . balduin is haunted by his double ( the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action . some of the scenes are incredible , the sense of doom when the devil disappears with balduin 's mirror image is amazing , as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society ( the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland ' at the edge of the town , no longer entirely human ( he has lost his soul ) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society . there are so many other things to say about this incredible film . paul wegener was an amazing actor and director , a cultural hero of mine . it helps if you know a bit about german history at the time this film was made and about german doppelganger tradition ( do n't google it , get a proper book ) just remember , it 's a very early film , it 's a little clumsy at times , but considering what it has to say and it 's tragic finale , it 's one of the best ever ( yes it is ! )
i found 'time at the top ' an entertaining and stimulating experience . the acting , while not generally brilliant , was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good . as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic , it is certainly one of the better works in the genre ( children 's sci-fi ) . normally , i would say that canada , the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children , and 'time at the top ' does nothing to discount this theory ! i do n't think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people . a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them . both are in abundance in this film . the special effects are good , without detracting from the story , or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations . it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film , but it would have totally destroyed its entire 'raison d'etre ' . the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie , and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy . overall , this film is highly satisfactory , and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through children 's eyes , or those that try to , like myself ! now , i really must read the original book , as soon as possible .
hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones . the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers . as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes . where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure . sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood .
it was fabulous ! the photography , editing , cinematography , music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination . it was the enjoyment of `` slumming , '' without going through the danger . we were there ! the dream sequences and flashback-sequence-ending were fresh . it spoke to me . keep up the good work ! another of that genre is city of god . also - do n't laugh ! - the comedy , desperately seeking susan . nice ensemble types , with great performances by all . sorry , i think training day fits that genre as well , with fantastic performances by an ensemble cast . i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences , but all-in-all , a great film !
i love this movie . my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed . it 's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it 's also nice that it 's not just another frank sinatra movie where it 's mostly him doing the singing . i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando 's own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice . stubby kaye 's `` sit down , you 're rockin ' the boat '' is a foot-tappin ' , sing-a-long that i just love . he is a hard act to follow with his version and i still like his the best . vivian blaine is just excellent in this part and `` adelaide 's lament '' is my favorite of her songs . i really thought jean simmons was perfect for this part . maybe i would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part , it made sense . michael kidd 's choreography is timeless . if it were being re staged in the year 2008 , i would not change a thing . i find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage , even though it was on film . i thought the movie was well cast . i performed in regional versions of this and it 's one of my favorites of that period .
i 'm a big fan of films where people get conned , and house of games is almost the pinnacle of the 'films where people get conned ' genre . in short , it 's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels , and never truly revealing what 's happening , while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you 've just seen . the film cons the audience on many occasions , and despite us knowing this ; it 's still difficult to guess where it 's going , and every twist comes off as a surprise . as mentioned , i 'm a big fan of cons in movies and the plot of this one follows a female psychiatrist who receives a patient with a huge debt owed to a fellow gambler . she then goes to the gambler in an attempt to help out her patient , and on the way gets drawn into the art of reading people in order to pull off a con . house of games breathes a sleazy atmosphere throughout , and david mamet does well in establishing his film 's setting in the underground levels of the city . the film is well acted also , with all concerned bringing life and believability to their characters with the greatest of skill . joe mantegna stars as the con man at the heart of the film , and although his performance is a little under wrought , he 's always solid and believable as the villain of the piece . lindsay crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work , and again is believable in her role . she may not be the greatest looker , but at least she can act . the way that the film executes it 's plot is the main star of the show , however , and you will no doubt be amazed on multiple occasions as to how the film constantly manages to amaze and deceive the viewer . at times it 's almost like we are in the thick of the action and being conned by the con men in the film . another thing that 's great about this film is the way that it shows the audience how to pull off certain cons , which is useful if you 're interested in making twenty bucks , say . all in all , house of games is a truly first rate thrill ride .
horror gods boris karloff and bela lugosi should be more than sufficient a reason for any genre-lover to watch a film , and , even though the most convincing one they are not the only reason to watch this particular little sci-fi/horror gem . while lambert hillyer 's `` the invisible ray '' of 1936 does not nearly share the brilliance of other contemporary films starring karloff ( `` frankenstein , `` bride of frankenstein '' , `` the mummy '' , ... ) or lugosi ( `` white zombie '' , `` island of the lost souls '' , `` dracula '' , ... ) , or both ( `` the black cat '' , `` the raven '' , ... ) , this is doubtlessly a highly entertaining film that no lover of cult cinema should consider missing . compared to other universal horror pictures , the storyline seems a bit silly , but in a delightful manner . karloff and lugosi , of course , shine as always , and the film furthermore profits from great sceneries and an excellent photography . karloff plays dr. janos rukh , a brilliant scientist who has invented a technique to look into the past through a telescope , and finds out that a meteor has hit the earth thousands of years ago . stunned by rukh 's invention , the celebrated french scientist dr. felix benet ( bela lugosi ) , invites him to join an expedition in to find the meteor . in africa , rukh makes a discovery that is capable of causing great beneficence and great destruction alike ... it is somewhat odd that karloff , who was in fact british , plays a hungarian scientist here while lugosi , who was hungarian , plays a french scientist , but they are both excellent as usual . as far as i am concerned , these two horror deities could have probably been filmed reading the telephone directory , and i am sure they would have made something out of it - either man is an icon of the horror genre , and seeing them together is a treat for every fan of the genre . by the way , this is one of the few films , if not the only one , in which it is obvious that lugosi was actually taller than karloff . frances drake makes a very good female lead in her role of dr rukh 's beautiful young wife . the rest of the performances are also good , if not particularly worth mentioning . other than the casting of karloff and lugosi , the film 's greatest qualities are probably the atmosphere due to great settings and photography , as well as the wonderfully cheesy and highly entertaining storyline . my main complaint is that i would have wished for more screen time for lugosi , and for his role to have a bit more significance . he is fantastic as always , but his role could have been bigger , and more sinister . otherwise , `` the invisible ray '' is a wonderfully entertaining film which should satisfy every lover of classic horror/sci-fi cinema , and a must-see for all my fellow lugosi/karloff fans .
this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now . a skilled tv director , well-trained in story-telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low-budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks , resulting in 'distorted ' lives . each character trying to live his own life , to watch and control the other , while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure , by political and historical forces well beyond his control . some call this destiny , but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film . there is no explicit political saying in 'distortion ' . characters never discuss politics , not even at the level of saying 'bastards ! ' when they hear that a new terror attack happens . their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded . they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb , and waiting for the next one to happen . personal , social , professional life seems to work someway , but is deeply flawed and influenced by events . the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid-life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes . he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show - another failed man , former military , whose business and family life dismantles under the events . he starts to write a play that carbon-copies the reality and will bring it to the stage , in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as 'synecdoche , new york ' . it 's not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo , he certainly needs not that , but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film ( and the first directed by kaufman ) . as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality-meets-stage-meets-reality melange which never lacks logic , at least not artistic logic . bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent , trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them . his style is much more free here than in his tv series , and the 'distortion ' effects , although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over . the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically , but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film .
master cinéaste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family.in this film too we see resnais ' family members like pierre arditi , sabine azema , andré dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death , religion , suicide , love and their overall implications on our daily lives.the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends , they address each other using a formal you.in 1984 , while making l'amour à mort , resnais dealt with time , memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence : is love stronger than death ? it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories.message of this film is loud and clear : true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation.l'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped .
the book on which this movie is based was excellent ; it took a while to come to grips with houellebecq 's unconventional style but once i understood the mood behind the writing i was completely drawn into the author 's world of sadness . in fact , no other book has affected me so much . this is not necessarily a good thing - it elucidated my own personal struggle and has made the futility of my own struggle harder to accept . houellebecq 's insights are masterfully captured by harel and the hero 's apathy and indifference to a world which has rejected him is perfectly portrayed . this is a movie which reveals today 's society for the lowly male in all its horror . hopefully , things will change in the future but for the present we have to accept the rat-race as shown in this movie . it 's probably best that harel or houellebecq do not create a work of genius like this again . one is enough for any man .
i saw this movie when i was a little girl . and i have enjoyed it every time . sure the graphics are a little cheesy , compared to now , but back in the 70 's it was great . i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful . that was how i remember my christmases were with my family - magical . santa claus was amazing and i could n't wait for him to come back each year . if you have a child/children and speak spanish , bring them up watching this old fashioned version of `` santa claus '' . it 's a different version than we are used to today , but who says there is one way ? it 's a fun movie to watch . it teaches children good vs. bad . i do n't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this , but the spanish is the best . enjoy and happy holidays ! feliz navidad !
now my friends , films like `` la bête '' ( aka `` the beast '' or `` o monstro '' ) only can be done in the old continent : ) , in this film we see all : horses dirty sex , nymphomaniac kind off gorilla , non sense dialogs , etc , etc , etc ... in the serious terms now , its an allegory , that men sometimes could be bestial , visceral and brutal , walerian borowczyk ( the director ) shows us the loss of innocence , sexual violence , rape and brutality . its a astonishing cinematic experience , bizarre and full of grotesque scenes . for all fans of european shocking exploitation , i recommend this film.if you like this one i recommend : `` orloff against the invisible man '' and `` alterated states '' .
i agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far . i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i 've ever seen . as stated before , i recall that i began watching , thinking it was just another nature study - interesting , not necessarily special , but i was so wrong . not only was the story of the colony incredible , but i remember the music as being so much a part of it 's appeal . if i remember correctly , it was native americn pipes ( akin to the music at the end of one flew over the cookoo 's nest ) . i , too have been looking for a copy . this should be required watching for anybody , but especially the schools . it should be re-released .
george cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch . ronald colman 's performance , which earned him an oscar , still stands up despite a few overwrought moments  it 's hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life . there are a number of interesting subtexts and cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much . the script by garson kanin and ruth gordon is brilliant , mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from shakespeare 's `` king lear '' as a reference to both the film 's main theme of jealousy and colman 's character 's obsession with identity . several interesting things about this movie  superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors . in other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets . but i do n't really think this story 's primary concern is acting or the job/art of acting per se . i think anthony 's struggles represents a broader existential question , a deeply buried uncertainty about identity . there 's a key , i feel , in his relationship with his ex-wife britta ( signe hasso ) . he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration . and at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her . i 'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me , especially because it 's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top . perhaps the implication is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship . marriage implies a `` union of the soul '' in the traditional conception . it 's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film . it 's not completely unprecedented ( hawks ' comedy `` his girl friday '' springs to mind , among others ) , but it is unusual and probably significant , especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation . in a way , the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self-love .
stargate is the best show ever . all the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles . i love the connection between the characters . if you have not seen this show i very highly recommend it . although this program is compared to star trek a lot of the time it actually ca n't be because it is completely different . i am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks . unfortunately i live in new zealand and we do not get stargate on our tv so if i want to see it i have to buy the dvds and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time ( which is highly depressing ) . however this program is very very good and is a must see , but be warned it is highly addictive . so in summery i love stargate ( and amanda tapping ) .
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl . although i do n't remember much about it , i must say that it was a pretty good show . also , i do n't think i 've seen every episode . however , if you ask me , it was still a good show . i vaguely remember the theme song . everyone was ideally cast , the costume design was great . the performances were top-grade , too . i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i 'll be able to see every episode . before i wrap this up , i 'd like to say that i 'll always remember this show in my memory forever , even though i do n't think i 've seen every episode . now , in conclusion , when and if this show is ever brought back on the air , i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good .
this was one of the best shows ever made for tv . full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns . compulsive viewing . i was lucky i saw this in the uk . they might have got the episode order wrong , i ca n't remember , but it at least was on at a regular time every week . my girlfriend and i got hooked from the trailer in , and neither of us is a big fan of american series normally . after the pilot , we knew this was something special . we missed a couple of episodes , and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol . great casting , superb acting . gary cole was absolutely brilliant , better even than his role as custer . lucas black turned in an amazing performance for a kid , and paige turco was at her best too since party of five . and nick searcy of course , as the sheriff 's long suffering sidekick . yes , there were some confusing and perplexing bits , which i presume would have been explained later , and no doubt would have been in a later series . that made the ending weak , and you could tell they 'd killed it . made us go what ? why did they do that with one of the best shows ever ? shoot the exec .
this is one fine movie , i can watch it any time . rauol julia gave an outstanding performance , we lost him too soon . richard dryfus is a great talent . only thing it needed more of was dana delany , what a babe !
i grew up in houston and was nine when this movie came out . as a result i do n't remember anything about the movie . but i do remember the sensation it caused from gilley 's and the mechanical bull to johnny lee 's hit song `` lookin ' for love '' which still brings back memories of childhood whenever i hear it . however , a few years ago i saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all i can say is , i was blown away . few movies have hit me harder . this movie is as raw and real as you can get . from uncle bob 's ranch house , the chemical plant in texas city , gilley 's dance hall , and bud and sissy . and maybe for that reason it does n't have a wider appeal . but no matter how you feel about country music ( i for one ca n't stand it despite my houston roots ) urban cowboy is a unique slice of american pie . for that reason i love it !
i thought that ice age was an excellent movie ! as a woman of 30 , with no children , i still seem to really enjoy these humorous , witty animated movies . sid is the best character i have seen in some time , better than bartok in anastasia ( although he was really humorous , and i did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten ) and even more humorous than melman in madagascar . i have seen the movie at least 15 times ( i own it obviously ) and i quote the movie at work ( on many occasions ... yes , still ) . my favourite scene is the part where sid says `` oh , oh , oh , i love this game ! '' and sid and manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the `` tigers '' ... '' pack of wolves , pack of bears , pack of fleas , pack of whiskers , pack of noses , pack a derm ? , pack of lies , pack of troubles , pack a wallop , pack of birds , pack of flying fish ... '' or however that part goes ! that is the funniest part about the whole movie , although i also really enjoyed the humour behind `` putting sloths on the map '' and many other parts as well . the only animated movie that can remotely compare to ice age is `` brother bear '' .
david lynch 's ( 1999 ) film of john roach / mary sweeney 's story is set in iowa and wisconsin some time well before the film 's eventual release . we come into the life of alvin straight ( richard farnsworth ) late on in life . his medical condition is poor , his life is mostly behind him and he knows it . this makes what he decides to do , even more remarkable and endearing . he decides ( and at every point in the film his own name reverberates through his actions ) to put a few things straight . alvin is , by this time in his life , a man of great experience but modest means . his daughter rose ( sissy spacek ) struggles with a speech impediment that makes communication a great effort on the audience 's behalf . but it 's worth it , because rose 's story can not help but come out as the film progresses . this film is the story of a journey . but like all journeys it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense . early on in the film , we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey , which no elderly gentleman of alvin 's age should reasonably undertake . but along the way , we slowly learn how alvin has so many qualifications which equip him to achieve his unlikely objective . his objective is very simple and straightforward . his brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him . he has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time . along the way , alvin meets many people . the way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film . we come to know who alvin straight is , from what alvin straight does . and at the end of the film , we know who we are .. better .
the performances in this movie were fantastic . the dialogue was great . jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as `` kid '' collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel . far superior to `` the grifters '' , which was a good movie , this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir roots from which the story came . i recommend this movie to all film noir fans .
the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says - `` is the piston firing short ? '' ( implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée ) was hilarious . i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie . very lovable and very intelligent too . her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours . the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well . einstein had a romantic side to his psyche ? the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well . it 's awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival . it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt . i do n't see why it does n't figure in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century . great movie , it has the presidential seal of approval on it !
i loved this movie . i 'm a mexican and was in the least offended by it . in fact , i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico . it 's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse . it angers me to read in the news how killers , kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells . we should have someone like creasy , denzel washington 's character . a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante . kidnapping is flourishing industry down here ( at least in the big cities ) . i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one 's creasy did his fine job upon . that would be so marvelous ( sorry , i am that resentful ! ) . man on fire is a gripping film that you ca n't miss . it might be hard on some of you , if you are n't used to reading subtitles ( mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies ) but the effort will be well worth it . some of the editing is a bit fuzzy ... kind of like traffic , remember ? ( another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is ) . the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half . i swear you 'll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers . his performance is nothing short of excellent . the ending ( no spoilers , ok ! ! ! ) is a bit sad , but i 'm sure you 'll like it anyway . man on fire is one of the year 's best movies . a `` must own '' for a dvd collection ! 9 * out of 10
three girls ( an all-female media-crew , including cult-actress barbara bach , no less ) visiting a small town to cover a festival , end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague . well-made little shocker , suffering a bit from some redundant dialogue-scenes and a rather thin plot-line ( that does n't do very well in hiding its secrets ) . one underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing ( as in : vintage shock-material ) , and this is basically what the film thrives on . performances & cinematography are pretty much above par ( compared to many other late 70's/early 80 's films in the same vein ) , but what really makes me recommend this film is the fairly long climax-scene in the basement-setting . from the moment that `` keller junior '' character was introduced , his performance made my jaw drop open and it did n't close until the end of the film . a very pleasant surprise to see actor sydney lassick ( who was funnily wacko in `` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest '' , and now utterly demented in `` the unseen '' ) take on one of the leading roles .
class reunion is a very underated comedy gem . it 's 1982 and the 1972 class of lizzie borden high return for there 10 year reunion , among them are the usual stereotypes , the hunk , babe , the fat guy & nerd etc , but the former students are in for a bumpy night , one of their classmates is walter baloer , the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home , walter escapes and now plans to avenge his humiliation , , , , despite the dark premise , this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags & set pieces . to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun & airplane movies you 'll love this , & what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry ? . a great comedy which deserves a wider audience .
this one 's a romp ; many trek fans do n't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones , but this one is so well executed for what it is , so successful as pure entertainment , it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes , no matter what mood i 'm in . several well known future movies ( `` westworld '' ) and tv shows ( the more bland `` fantasy island '' ) took their cue from the premise of this episode ( then , of course , the tng show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology ) . beautifully filmed ( especially evident in the restored version and on dvd ) and directed , it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the enterprise has just arrived to . it 's odd that no animal life , even insects , seems to exist here ( how are flowers pollinated , for example ) , but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past ( kirk has a people-heavy past , it turns out ) , as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories . sulu even finds an old-style police revolver ( adding to his collection of swords , no doubt ) . by this point in the trek series ( halfway thru the first season ) , the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we 'd come to know over the many proceeding years . here , we get to really see them relax , converse and work together to figure out this episode 's puzzle : the strong narrative is a mystery again , of sorts , and the audience is along for the ride as kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them . it 's almost whimsical , following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue ( the enterprise had , it 's suggested , just completed a harrowing mission ) . then dr. mccoy is killed by a knight on horseback ; yes , this is dr. mccoy 's final episode ... just kidding . but , it 's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story . mccoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and , like the best trek episodes , the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic , more desperate tempo of action and suspense . this is all signaled by kirk 's resolute response to sulu , who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after mccoy 's death - kirk will get to the bottom of all this , come what may . but , it does n't get much easier for kirk : what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days , a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet . yet , this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness , with another of kirk 's past acquaintances . this episode runs the gamut of all human experience , rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet . it 's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what 's happened , as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines ( unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there ) . and there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to 'work ' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion , or we just do n't function in a 'normal ' natural way . also , note the appearance of the very cute yeoman barrows and the sudden absence of yeoman rand , who did not return until the first trek movie in '79 . i believe that after this episode , even more trek fans could n't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters . but i leave this episode with a final , perhaps tantalizing thought : if mccoy was killed ( verified by spock ) , how do we know it was our real mccoy who beamed back up to the ship ? perhaps this explains why this mccoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with data .
this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s . it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today . the story is about a vietnam vet ( kris kristofferson ) being recruited by his brother ( jan-michael vincent ) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of . it 's great seeing kris play against type . bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars . jan-michael shows real movie star persona in this film . i do n't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv . it 's a great flick for guys who like movies .
this one grew on me . i love the r.d . burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story i found much to be moved by as i kept re-watching the movie . the brother-sister plot line is powerful , i thought ; there 's also more probably obligatory stuff , like bar fights , a loony crime story , etc . that are just distracting . ( though not unfunny from a certain point of view . ) also the english translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch , and as loony as it is i am grateful to him for doing it . like many of the bollywood movies i 've seen , this one is melodramatic and opera-like , including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister , and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl , grown up and troubled ( she had been told her brother and mother were dead ) , numbing her pain with drugs . a super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement , which brought hordes of seekers to india , from an indian point of view , that sees them as people driven to india by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies , but nonetheless , in india , living only for the pleasures of the moment . the hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are truly wonderful , and accurate in their tone ( i 'm old enough to remember ) , and i feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned-out kids are actual hippie extras , as i remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the east getting this kind of work in bollywood . ( it is not about the actual hare krishna movement , though the movie hippies sing a krishna/rama chant , as do a group of actual indian devotees , unrelated to the hippies , in the opening scene of the movie . ) ~virginia
some films just simply should not be remade . this is one of them . in and of itself it is not a bad film . but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title . liam neeson was excellent as he always is , and most of the cast holds up , with the exception of owen wilson , who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke . but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it 's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects . again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film . but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more .
* * * * spoiler alert * * * * all throughout australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like sydney . it 's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer david burton , richard chamberlain , got involved in a case , as a defense attorney , involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a sydney bar . having five fellow aborigines arrested for billy cormans , athol compton , death it 's determined by the police coroner that billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders . yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder . david defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to billy to themselves and take what 's coming to them from the court . one of the defendants chris , david gulpili , begin to somehow invades david 's dreams as if he want 's to tell him what was really behind billy 's death . david at first not taking his dreams of chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse . chris confirms david 's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that david saw chris have in his dreams . later meeting chris and , what turns out to be an aborigine shaman , charlie ( nandjiwarna amagula ) who came to his house that evening david is told that he , like charlie , has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother 's grandfather . those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the australian continent . the earth , chris tells david , is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it 's place . david is confused about what both chris and charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen . david want 's to know if it 's all aborigine folklore or there 's some scientific facts , or logic , behind their end of world-like revelations . by now it 's obvious that both chris and charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern sydney . that alone can get chris off , as well as his four friends , for the murder of billy . since the australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines , leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves . still chris refuses to admit he 's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in billy 's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days . david now determined to find out what was the reason for chris ' silence , and why billy had to die , is taken by chris to the scene of the crime . it 's there that david finds out that billy betrayed chris ' tribe members by going there with billy not being a member of chris 's aborigine tribe . it 's also revealed to david that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the austrailan aborigines as both charlie and his step-father rev . burton , david parslow , told him . the stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that david 's been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions . it comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the pacific ocean into the australian coast city of sydney and then submerges the entire continent .
judy davis shows us here why she is one of australia 's most respected and loved actors - her portrayal of a lonely , directionless nomad is first-rate . a teenaged claudia karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country 's most popular actors in years to come , with future roles in the big steal , the heartbreak kid , dating the enemy , risk and the acclaimed tv series the secret life of us . ( incidentally , karvan , as a child , was a young girl whose toy panda was stolen outside a chemist 's shop in the 1983 drama going down with tracey mann . ) if this films comes your way , make sure you see it ! ! rating : 79/100 . see also : hotel sorrento , radiance , vacant possession , lantana .
so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it . we would watch it all the time . when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we 'd watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa 's magical toys . i 'm 21 now and i still love this movie , some old friends and i recently got together and watched it , we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little . one friend actually bought this movie and grandpa 's magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie . this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe , no violence , no bad language , just lots of great songs and important lessons .
this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen . if this film had been directed by larry clark , then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place . instead , the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting , and how it effected the victims who survived . i had seen busy phillips in other films before , but her performance in this movie is by far , her best . the only other movie that i 've seen with erika christensen is `` swim fan '' which made me almost not want to watch this film , but she turned in a very good performance herself . this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry . trust me when i tell you , that does n't happen very often . home room is a beautiful film , and that 's all there is too it ...
an excellent movie and great example of how scary a movie can be without really showing the viewer anything . it 's a set of four stories all revolving around the tenants of a charmingly old-fashioned house and their various gruesome and horrific fates , all tied together by a wrap-around story about a scotland yard inspector searching for a missing horror film star . it starts out with a story about a mystery writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic , followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed over a wax figure in a museum , then a story about a sweetly angelic little child who is anything but , and closing with the story of what happened to the missing film star and what he does to the inspector . it 's a gorgeous print that lets you really appreciate the work of director duffell and what he was able to accomplish with a very small budget . add to that the acting talents of peter cushing , christopher lee , denholm elliott , joss ackland , ingrid pitt and jon pertwee and you 've got a movie that can be enjoyed again and again . just do n't answer the phone if anyone from stoker real estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful house in the english countryside
as i reach the `` backside '' of 35 i find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed , drug influenced teens of today . it was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today . this film drives that point home to the core . if you are a late 70 's fan you 'll love the film . from kiss-posters to an angel concert this movie rocks ! watch for a young laura dern . why they did n't have more songs from the runaways i 'll never know ? i did have a problem with randy quaid 's character deflowering a 16 year old girl . while he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude 's house . the cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff . foxes belongs right there with over the edge , fast times , dazed & confused , and kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks . i say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all .
jeremy northam 's characterization of the stuttering , mild mannered bookish morgan sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of lucy liu 's presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch . his offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit , done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face , neck and lips . no matter the brainwashing , love has a way of persevering . love also can not be `` brainwashed in '' with either of his two fake wives . in gradual stages , he begins to dispense with his glasses , to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses . the music is fantastic , hypnotic , sexy and appropriately driving at times . the extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi `` film noir '' in the tradition of many classic thrillers . i would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in lucy liu 's portrayal , whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states , the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith , some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part . she is just no match for northam 's talents , but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author .
what a delightful film ... accompanied by oscar-winning composer rachel portman 's lush , emotional and dreamy music , this film remains a pure delight worthy of viewing more than once a year . incredible casting ... gwyneth paltrow was perfect for the role of emma . toni collette was great as harriett smith . the character who stole the film was miss bates ! ! ! she was mesmerizing to watch , one finds oneself on the edge of ones ' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically with her . one of the most endearing characters i have come across in ages . from one of the opening scenes when she is thanking mr. woodhouse for sending `` that lovely quarter-hind of pork ... pork , mother ! ! ! '' she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired mother , mrs. bates ( played by emma thompson 's mother , phyllida law ) who looks forlorn and lost . the comical ways that emma would avoid the grating miss bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when emma insults miss bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart . we then see poor miss bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one 's heart ripped out to her on her behalf . it is a classic scene , one to be rewound and played over & over ... the ending is right up there with `` sense & sensibility '' and provides one of life 's greatest lessons about how one should marry one 's best friend ... i hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself . i adored it !
but the opposite , sorry bud , i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject ( and you have ) . this film is terrible , the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh , most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look of ... its your line now , then i will react . best british comedy ? please buddy , have a strong word with your bad bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this film is awful . i mean well done to the people involved ... they have made a film ... and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they 're nan bought them ... was that overly harsh ? i do apologise ...
vincent cassel plays the part of paul , an ex-con assigned to an office job where he meets carla , a secretary who is quite deaf ' , when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not ( played by emmanuelle devos ) . together they help each other to develop as people . what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters  not fitting into obvious stereotypes . paul appears uneasy in the office environment , is it that he 's just not cut out for work ? this belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shines . the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally , even if we think it is harmless or justified . finally , it is a film full of great moments ' both touching and humorous . one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby . she continues to cuddle it  but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort .
truly this is a 'heart-warming ' film . it won the george peobody award , winning over `` roots '' , so that may tell you something of the essence of this film . i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law , eugene logan , the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him . i would love to have his only grand-daughters , my daughters , see this film , as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons . my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again . one of my friends said it was her favorite movie . i wo n't 'spoil ' this movie for you .
as predictable as a hallmark card , but not without merit , the rookie makes for a solid outing . dennis quaid , the most reasonable jock actor working today , is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player jimmy morris . the film is never dumbed down for the children , as would be expected from a g rated film . as a sports film , the rookie is one of the best i have seen since any given sunday .
the information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately . the walter reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return . what this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars . the psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life . they are not just changed or affected , they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves . finally , this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma . we have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion ; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war . it does n't matter what side you are on , it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business . this film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly .
the location of the shop around the corner is precisely stated at the start of the film , balta street in budapest but it could really be in any place . the small number of sets reflect a middle european design but it could be a shop around any corner . the film is not about budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love , reflected in most of the main characters . alfred kralik and klara novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance , and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully . hugo matuschek , the owner of the shop , is having trouble with his wife , she only a voice at the end of the phone . ferencz vadas has a secret affair . ilona novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments . mr pirovitch 's life is centred around his wife and children . pepi katona 'plays santa claus ' to a girl at christmas . you even sense that quiet flora katchuck , while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone . the script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama . it moves effortlessly from scene to scene . it is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again , simple yet profound . the dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days . all the acting is magnificent . even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect . james stewart and margaret sullavan play off each other perfectly . he was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance . margaret sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days . some of her other films are worth catching . as mr matuschek , frank morgan is amazing . his moment of truth is very moving . gold stars all round to the performers . it is a well worn phrase that they do n't make them like they used to ( the vague re-make 'you 've got mail ' was dire ) but in this case it is true . the director lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit , charm and warm humanity .
lars von trier 's europa is a worthy echo of the third man , about an american coming to post-world war ii europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery . jean-marc barr plays leopold kessler , a german-american who refused to join the us army during the war , arrives in frankfurt as soon as the war is over to work with his uncle as a sleeping car conductor on the zentropa railway . what he does n't know is the war is still secretly going on with an underground terrorist group called the werewolves who target american allies . leopold is strongly against taking any sides , but is drawn in and seduced by katharina hartmann ( barbara sukowa ) , the femme fatale daughter of the owner of the railway company . her father was a nazi sympathizer , but is pardoned by the american colonel harris ( eddie considine ) because he can help get the german transportation system up and running again . the colonel soon enlists , or forces , leopold to be a spy ( without giving him a choice or chance to think about it ) to see if the werewolves might carry out attacks on the trains . soon , leopold is stuck in an adventure by being involved with both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way , where everyone and everything is not what it seems . its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything ( his lover , the terrorists , the colonel , annoying passengers , his disgruntled uncle , even the railway company 's officials who come to examine his work ethic ) before he finally boils over and humorously and violently takes control . the film is endlessly unpredictable . the film stylishly shot , it always takes place at night during the winter with lots of falling snow . its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout . also , background screens displaying images that counter act with the images up front . add max von sydow 's hypnotic narration , and europa becomes a dreamlike place that 's out of this world . this is now a personal favorite film of mine .
first , i did like this film . it was well acted by all . however , i do n't understand comments i hear from people about a surprise ending . i knew nothing about this movie going in except a few `` got ta -see '' recommendations , but i knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes . ( i wo n't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others . ) still , despite it seeming obvious , i kept watching . it was nice to see how everything played out , filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes . i do n't hate it when i guess the ending early in a film . i only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery . will smith 's screen persona is just likable , even when he 's playing such a troubled character . he 's energetic and believable in everything that i 've seen him do . seven pounds is another fine performance . rosario dawson is a solid performer , portraying a quirky , rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition . beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and with rosario , if you do n't find her gorgeous , you should think about replacing your eyes . it was nice to see woody harrelson back on the screen . i have n't seen him much lately , but that could just be me . woody did n't have a tremendous amount of screen time , but he sold his jolly , piano-playing , blind man character for all it was worth . excellent . a cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic , neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic . i would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot . overall , i have to recommend this film not for the plotting , but for some very good performances , and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid .
i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film . for one , i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre , but given this , the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all . this is british comedy at its finest - dark , quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are . i must stop short , however , of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone ; i went to see it with several people , some english , some european and some american and while some of us loved it ( mainly from the first two groups ) , some hated it and found it worthless . if you think you 're into this kind of thing then go . if not , do n't . 10/10 .
bear in mind , any film ( let alone documentary ) which asserts any kind of truth , will generate an adverse and proportional amount of cynicism , from those to whom any suggestion of and or search for truths is already meaningless , those of you who are already masters of psychology , film , and captains of the soul , will no doubt find this movie redundant , after all , you already know everything there is to know . congrats . for those of us in the minority like myself , i found `` the perverts guide to cinmea '' .... mostly brilliant , and worth watching for those interested in movies , psychology , and modern philosophy . a little like scott mclouds ' `` understanding comics '' , director sophie fiennes , inter-grates slovene philosopher , psychologist , and social critic slavoj zizek right into many of the films and specif scenes he discusses . the cover is an image from `` the birds '' ( zizek takes a boat out to re-create the shot ) . lacanian psycho-analysis , does not necessarily scream , an evening of great fun ... but it is ! if you like movies that is .... having some knowledge of lacanian psycho-analysis helps ( symbolic , real , and imaginary ) are terms which get thrown around a little loosely at first , but the scenes which zizek selects and analyze make remarkably clear what was always for me , a very abstract subject . in fact , it 's probably better to have a familiarity with the films he 's discussing than with the terminology he uses , which becomes clearer as the film goes on . why i love , this film is n't because it picks great films to analyze or reveals great truths about lacan , but shows in a very practical and clever manner , where film and psychology ( and by default philosophy ) meet . why is `` the sound of music '' kinda fascistic , why is `` short cuts '' about more than just class and alienation , why do the birds attack in `` the birds '' , what is there to learn about the mind from `` alien resurrection '' , what does the planet of `` solaris '' want , what does `` psycho '' and `` the marx brothers '' have to do with each other , and what the hell is david lynch getting across in movie after movie ... well zizek has some ideas . the role of the voice in both `` the excorcist '' and `` star wars : revenge of the sith '' , is maybe the movies strongest and most lucid moment , when he gets into feminine sexual subjectivity i begin to wonder ... at one point zizek admits his feeling that flowers are a kind of decorative vagina dentatta , that they are disgusting and should be hidden from children ( jokingly , it seems but ... ) . anyway , it 's a fascinating documentary , which anyone who has ever seen a movie , and thought it meant something more than was literally stated , should make an attempt to see . and anyone interested in slavoj zizek , this is a must as well , much less dry than `` reality of the virtual '' , and more direct than `` zizek ! `` , two other pseudo-docs , about `` the elvis of contemporary cultural criticism '' , as he is being dubbed , in the english speaking world . `` the perverts guide to cinema '' is not about the role of sex in cinema . zizek claims cinema is the ultimate pervert art , because it teaches `` how to desire , and not what to desire '' , and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow for these desires to be articulated . this is not a film about finding the reality in cinema , it 's about finding the cinema in reality , and how important and exciting that can be . hard to find , and a bit long , but well worth the trouble , one of the most `` stimulating '' movie watching experiences i 've ever had .
in this excellent twentieth-century fox film-noir , the metropolis is a labyrinth of despair in which scavengers and predators survive by living off one another . brooding cityscapes lower over puny humanity in bleak expressionist symbolism . a prostitute has her purse snatched on the subway . it contains a microfilm , and a communist spy ring will go to any lengths to recover it . two parallel investigations unfold as both spies and cops hunt down the precious information . anti-hero pickpocket skip mccoy is played with scornful assurance by richard widmark . he knows the cops to be his moral equals and intellectual inferiors , so he taunts them : `` go on , '' he says to captain dan tiger ( murvyn vye ) , `` drum up a charge . throw me in . you 've done it before . '' in this pitiless world , the cops are just one more gang on the streets . just as candy the hooker bribes lightning louie to get a lead , so the police are busy paying stool pigeons for information . it is hard to believe that when widmark made this film he was already in early middle age . the 39-year-old star , coming to the end of his contract with fox , plays the upstart skip mccoy with the irreverent brashness of a teenager . today it may not be acceptable for the romantic lead to punch his love interest into unconsciousness then revive her by sloshing beer in her face , but by the mores of the period it signified toughness - and candy , after all , is a fallen woman . jean peters is radiant as candy . here , right in the middle of her five-year burst of b-movie fame , she is beautiful and engaging as the whore with the golden heart . she is the story 's victim , a martyr to her beauty as much as anything else . she means well , but is constantly being manipulated by cynical men - joey , skip and the cops . the real star of this movie is new york . haunting urban panoramas and snidering subway stations offer a claustrophobic evocation of the city as a living , malevolent force . like maggots in a rotting cheese , human figures scurry through the city 's byways . elevators , subway turnstiles , sidewalks - even a dumb waiter act as conduits for the flow of corrupt humanity . people cling to any niche that affords safety : moe has her grimy rented room , skip his tenebrous shack on the hudson river . as the characters move and interact , they are framed by bridge architecture , or lattices of girders , or are divided by hanging winch tackle . the personality of the city is constantly imposing itself . the angles and crossbeams of the wharf timbers are an echo of the gridiron street plan , and the card-index cabinets in the squadroom mimic the manhattan skyline . when joey 's exit from the subway is barred , it is as if the steel sinews of the city are ensnaring him . a surprising proportion of this film is shot in extreme close-up . character drives the plot , as it should , and the close-ups are used to augment character . when skip interrogates candy , the close-up captures the sexual energy between them , belying the hostility of skip 's words . jean peters ' beauty is painted in light , in exquisite soft focus close-ups . the device is also employed to heighten the tension . the opening sequence , the purse snatch , contains no dialogue : the drama relies entirely on close-up for its powerful effect . snoopers , and snoopers upon snoopers , populate the film . moe ( thelma ritter ) makes a living as an informant , and her place in the hierarchy is accepted , even by her victims . when skip observes , `` she 's got ta eat '' , he is chanting a recurring refrain . just as 'straight ' new yorkers peddle lamb chops or lumber , the underworld traffics in the commodity of information . and yet even the stool pigeons are superior to joey and his communist friends . joey 's feet on moe 's bed symbolise a transgression of the most basic moral code . joey is beyond the pale . moe will not trade with joey , even to preserve her life : `` ... even in our crummy business , you got ta draw the line somewhere . '' `` pick-up '' was made in the depths of the cold war . richard nixon had just been chosen as the republican vice-presidential candidate , having made his name with his phoney alger hiss expose - bogus communist microfilm and all . the mccarthy show trials were a daily reality . we see the cops in the movie inveigh against `` the traitors who gave stalin the a-bomb '' . new york can be seen as a giant receptacle in which human offal cheats , squeals and murders . containers form a leitmotif throughout the film . moe carries her trade mark box of ties , and candy 's purse , container of the microfilm , is the engine of the plot . skip keeps his only possessions in a submerged crate , symbolising his secretive street-wisdom . the paupers ' coffins , moving down the hudson on a barge , are containers of just one more cargo being shifted around the pitiless metropolis . the film is a masterpiece of composition . candy is shown above the skulking skip on the rickety gangway of the shack , signifying her moral ascendancy . when the gun is placed on the table , the extreme perspective makes it look bigger than candy - violence is beginning to dwarf compassion . the lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore 's hook , reminding us that their love is neither pure nor absolute , but contingent upon the whims of the sinister city . enyard the communist is a shadow on a wall , or a disembodied puff of cigarette smoke . he is like the lone alley cat amongst the garbage - a predatory phantom of the night . camera shots from under taxi hoods , inside newspaper kiosks and through the bars of hospital beds constantly reinforce in us the awareness that we are all trapped in the metropolis . we are civilisation 's mulch .
i first saw this movie when i was about 10 years old . unfortunately i could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night . now i bought it on dvd because i can remember that i liked it . this is really not an ordinary horror movie . it has some horror elements but i rather categorize it as fantasy . i liked it but i hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes . especially the scene when anna 's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short . now to the plot . this movie is about a young girl named anna who gets ill . while she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse . when she fells a sleep , which often strangely happens just immediately , she finds herself near the house on a big green field . she realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams . one day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to . as she forgets to draw his legs ( because he is sitting behind a window ) the boy can not walk . later she is being told by the doctor , that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn , she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams . she also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams . as she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house . she makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting . she tries to rubber him out but realizes that she can not change anything already drawn . and next time she falls asleep the horror begins . her father is mad and blind ( because she draw s * * * on his head to mark him as 'invalid ' ) and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill anna and his friend . her dreams became a horrendous nightmare . they manage to escape and to kill her father and anna can finally wake up . than anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed . the doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so . they tell anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings . anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to . she runs to the watchtower and meets the boy ( i am just not mentioning his name because i can not remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page ) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever . there were a few thing i did not understand in the movie . first of all it was the ending which i absolutely dislike . i think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short . how does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to anna as he is supposed to be dead ? why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ? i hated that scene it was so dumb to me . it almost ruined the main horror scene . things i liked were the scene with the photograph of anna 's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene . i liked the boy . the actor was awesome . he was even better than anna . i also liked how anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage . overall a good movie . i give it a 8 out of 10 .
7 if you 're a kid- 6 if you claim to be an adult . this semi-sequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba , retelling the original story through their eyes , including the story of how they met . in the grand tradition of disney , inferior sequels are made , and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits . you can be as sceptical as you want about this , but kids and fans of the series will likely not care ; their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels . this works because of the charm of the much-loved central characters , the quick pace , the in-jokes involving the first film , and for older viewers there are some funny gags . the animation is as good as ever , if a little less flamboyant than the original , but the plot here is all about taking it easy , hakuna matata . timone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film , frequently stopping mid-film to joke about parts of it , like a real audience . we see how timone is a near outcast , he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home . on the way he meets pumba , another outcast and they become friends . soon they meet simba , a lion cub , natural predator of t and p , but they form a trio . however , when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group , it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not , and how . of course the usual disney elements and themes are here , friendship , good versus evil etc . the plot is simple but works on many levels , making it smarter than your average animated movie . as the cg movies appear , disney 's traditional form must become smarter , but not forget the roots which made them popular . toy story and all that have come since have been clever , with jokes to suit all ages , and it seems this is the way the market is shifting . however , there will always be a place for films like this , and you can not go wrong buying this for the youngsters . 7 out of 10
friz freleng 's 'rumours ' is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime . produced , as were all the snafu shorts , to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films , 'rumours ' is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan . when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing , it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war . this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long , rubbery piece of baloney and several strange , fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his country 's military . 'rumours ' is inventive , fast paced and funny , all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured , `` do n't badmouth the military '' message . it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts .
hidden frontier is a fan made show , in the world of star trek . the story takes place after voyager has returned from the delta-quadrant . it has some characters from the official star trek shows , but most of them are original to the show . the show takes place on the star base deep space 12 and on several space ships , which gives it opportunities the official shows do n't have . the characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy , which characters in shows with only one ship does n't have . the show has good computer animation of spaceships , but the acting takes place in front of at green-screen and it gives a green glow around the actors . not all the actors are equally good , but most do fine . the episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes . that is a bit more like in babylon 5 , than in most official star trek shows . hidden frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using . all in all i enjoyed watching it .
one can only imagine the film mr. welles might have finished without the interference of the studio ! this film is a flawed welles , but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps america 's best motion picture director of all times ! we can see the toll it took on orson welles the filming of this movie . the story has a lot of holes in it , perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that did n't trust the director . it is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to imdb that compare orson welles with the coen brothers , roman polanski , even woody allen , when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself . no one was more original and creative in the history of american cinema than mr. welles . lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the film forum in new york just ended , or his films either on tape or dvd form . rita hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here . if she was a beauty with her red hair , as a blonde , she is just too stunning for words . everett sloan and glenn anders made an excellent contribution to the movie . the only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to orson welles body of work , was his own appearance in it . had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret michael o'hara , a different film might have been achieved altogether . orson welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street . the visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work , the vision and the talent he gave us .
i saw this movie the day it came out last year . hilarious i thought . well , now it 's on video and i saw it again . i love this movie ! the things they do are sometimes dumb but that 's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time . the special effects are okay , but the witty dialog will have you rolling . i 'm the kind of person that 'll say i 'm inspired by this movie , so if you like dramas and other stuff , avoid . but for all others , enjoy ! the acting is superb . hank azaria is hands down the best ( he 's neither a commie , nor a fruit ) followed by ben stiller ( uh , do n't correct me . it sickens me ) and then william h. macy delivering his best performance ( outshining fargo ) everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo , but i think kel mitchell was pretty good as invisible boy . two problems : the most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between stiller and claire forlani , and the casanova parole hearing . some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way , but they 're a blast . kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it 's hilarity is gone , but bam they switch and you 're ready for more . i swear after seeing this , you will be tired from the explosive climax ( which i think was pretty cool ) the camera is pretty cool also , moving at a furious pace with the actors . also , tom waits delivers an outstanding performance ( he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him ) and like someone else said , the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them . captain amazing is pretty funny , ( especially his speech to casanova about his perfect plan-i was rolling ) and rush is pretty cool as casanova . one beef : the funniest comedian ever ( eddie izzard ) is almost wasted , but his heart is in the right place . so all in all , a wonderful movie . i give it twenty stars and hope that someday , everyone will see the brilliance in the film 's best parody , the six million dollar man one . laughing right now as i think about it . 20/10
the sopranos ( now preparing to end ) is the very peak of adult television and drama . when the sopranos hits the mark , it really hits the mark . using great writing and great actors ( most of them being extras from goodfellas ) the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way . heading up the cast is james gandolfini , who for all intensive purposes is tony soprano , and edie falco , who certainly holds her own . the series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary ( usually violence and foul language ) . tony sirico , michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting . seasonal extras are also worth note including names like steve buscemi ( great ! ) , joe pantoliano ( great ! ) , david proval ( good ) , robert patrick , robert loggia and frank vincent . the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique tv . symbolism and simple story lines , dreams and shoot-outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect hbo package . watch it ...
while it was filmed at a florida national guard site , `` tigerland '' totally reminded me of fort polk , la. , firing ranges , maneuver areas , waist-deep water and all . the movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my ait in 1974 . the difference between the tigerland year , 1971 , and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they were n't going back to vietnam , as it was pretty much all over , so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all . that was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s , which i know for a fact as i stayed in until 2004 . i never heard anyone mention `` tigerland '' but the army did have realistic vietnam training villages at different bases across the u.s. vietnam vets tell me that up to 1972 basic & ait could be pretty rough and rugged , because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train vietnam-bound men those skills to make it , although that was not always the case . both a drill sergeant at polk and later one of my vietnam vet ncos , when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at fort bliss , told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves . this movie rates high .
... for paris is a moveable feast . '' ernest hemingway it is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized paris in paintings , novels , songs , poems , short but unforgettable quotes , and yes - movies . the celebrated film director max ophüls said about paris , `` it offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights , breakfast in montmartre with cognac in your glass , coffee and lukewarm brioche , gigolos and prostitutes at night . everyone in the world has two fatherlands : his own and paris . '' paris is always associated with love and romance , and `` paris , je t'aime '' which is subtitled `` petite romances , '' is a collection of short films , often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world . in each , we become familiar with one of the city of light 20 arrondissements and with the parisians of all ages , genders , colors , and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages . in some of the `` petite romances '' we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest , closeness , and perhaps relationship : like for podalydès and florence muller in the street of montmartre in the opening film or for cyril descours and leïla bekhti as a white boy and a muslim girl whose cross-cultural romance directed by gurinder chadha begins on quais de seine . i would include into this category the humorous short film by gus van sant . in `` le marais '' one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness , asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand french . some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark . in walter salles and daniela thomas ' loin du 16ème , catalina sandino mareno ( amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace ) is single , working-class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work . one of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is `` place des fêtes '' by oliver schmitz . aïssa maïga and seydou boro co-star as two young people for who love could have happened . there were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere , and the city of love and light is no exception . another one that really got to me was `` bastille '' , written and directed by isabel coixet , starring sergio castellitto , miranda richardson , and leonor watling . castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife , richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress , the devastating news from his wife 's doctor arrives ... i can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems . i like some of them very much . the others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall , i am very glad that i bought the dvd and i know that i will return to my favorite films again and again . they are `` place des fêtes '' that i 've mentioned already , `` père-lachaise '' directed by wes craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever , oscar wilde ( alexander payne , the director of `` sideways '' ) who would save one troubled relationship . payne also directed `` 14th arrondissement '' in which a lonely middle-aged post-worker from denver , co explores the city on her own providing the voice over in french with the heavy accent . payne 's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious `` tuileries '' by joel and ethan coen with ( who else ? : ) ) steve buschemi is my absolute favorite . in both shorts , american tourists sit on the benches ( margo in the park , and steve in paris metro after visiting louvers ) observing the life around them with the different results . while margo may say , `` my feeling 's sad and light ; my sorrow is bright ... '' steve 's character will find out that sometimes , even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country .
i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start `` wanted : dead of alive '' the same year this film came out , or be in the magnificent seven two years later , he would not have done it . but he did , and we are the richer for it . sure it 's a camp classic . horror the way it was meant to be for the drive-in theater . it 's fun and nostalgic . it is interesting that the last lines of the film were : lieutenant dave : at least we 've got it stopped . steve andrews : yeah , as long as the arctic stays cold . they never would have imagined 52 years ago that the arctic would be thawing . the blob will soon return .
since it has been some years since i reviewed this classic i have decided to go back and review it more in dept , but first some insider notes from a movie critic . this animated series is one of those that i grew up with , it made my childhood joyful , it made it awesome , miss some of this stuff today that we clearly do n't see as much as we did back in the days , well on to the review ... talespin , or luftens helte which it is called in denmark is a great animated series , it is much like chip and dale , ducktales and a lot of those old ones , so it has that weird feeling surrounding it , i can not remember this series as much as i would like to remember it . but in my opinion it was very great , it came with some kind of message , not that wild of a message , however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven . now i do n't want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons , today we see something like ed edd and eddy or anything else weird like that , we have all these new or nearly new shows like hannah montana or something like that , yet i feel like that we do n't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days . now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much , to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like talespin being released again to the tv screen instead of all the new ones , give me back my childhood cartoons , give them to the kids i have some day , give them again ...
eddie izzard is genius with his non-stop humor . i could listen all day . his unique approach to life is quite logical . his understanding of discovery ( such as the heimlich maneuver ) is creative . eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think . i do n't know when i laughed so hard at anyone 's off-beat mind .
far richer in texture and character than even the classics from the 30 's and 50 's . george c. scott was born to be scrooge , just as he was born to be patton . mr. scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century . the character of scrooge as played by mr. scott seemed to jump off the screen . scott as scrooge brought an richer , more robust , yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in 18th century london . mr. scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal , understandable yet highly conflicted level ; his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen : yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper , almost as a soliloquy , as he would berate the christmas holiday in one breath , yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line . he could portray the sour and crusty scrooge , and a misunderstood , sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene . truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation .
it is ironic that during the '50s , when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal , he was virtually ignored by the critics he is now seen , however , as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama `` written on the wind '' is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation , alcoholism , and nymphomania it is about the twisted , fatal connections between sex , power , and money ... stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration , arrogance , jealousy , insanity , and some deep insecurities dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites , degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in town her best line : `` i 'm filthy . '' in one frantic scene , we see her shaking , quivering and sweating to a provocative mambo in another weeping alone over a model oil-derrick at her father 's desksymbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirk 's magnificent use of colors , lights , and careful use of mirrors
damn , i 've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still do n't get bored watching it . the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind-blowing to me . the cgis are quite bad imho , but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just ... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie . the whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable , the plot is so good . however although , the movie had little flaws , like e.g . sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too `` slow '' , but i do n't mean the scenic parts by that , i totally loved those . also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story , like when he is in the underground bunker-like thing of digicorps , where all their data is saved , and has this conversation with the guy down there ... but that may also just be me : d and the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized , they should have made the getting-back-true-memory-part a bit longer and `` louder '' but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again ...
i 've been impressed with chavez 's stance against globalisation for sometime now , but it was n't until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved . this film tells the story of coup/conspiracy by venezuela 's elite , the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments , to remove democratically elected president chavez , and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship . this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice , and is also a lesson to the rest of world ! i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands , and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime .
with a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million the people at fox animation and blue sky studios have done an incredible job . they have combined state-of-the-art digital animation , the perfectly cast voice talents of ray romano , john leguizamo and dennis leary ( among many others ) to create a highly entertaining , family film with a strong message about cooperation , friendship and caring for your fellow herd members . and how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd . while watching this film i got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders ! david newman -- yet another member of the newman family of hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and , at times , is positively toe tapping . the overall look of the film is incredible ; an intensely coloured , strangely believable fantasyland of snow , geysers , mud , rocks and ice . the individual characters were delightfully believable too , with the facial expressions of ray romano 's manfred ' being a particular treat . the entire sequence with the dodos will leave no doubt as to where the expression ` dumb as a dodo comes from . ' this is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless . it would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home .
seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv , it was a foregone conclusion i was gon na go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this . i also think this applies to eva longoria fans . the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president . as the investigation unfolds , it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete ( michael douglas ) . pleading innocence , pete goes on the fun , fugitive style , to search for the truth . it 's solid , but certainly not spectacular . a decent cast , a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty , but you could certainly do far worse .
i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott ( 2000 ) . both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship . in both films , the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town . both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them . the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film . laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty ( 1999 ) . joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing , very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji ( 1995 ) and jurassic park iii ( 2001 ) .
this is an amazing movie from 1936 . although the first hour is n't very interesting ( for the modern viewer ) , the stylish vision of the year 2036 that comes afterwords makes up for it . however , do n't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog - the sound quality and accents ( it 's american - but `` 1930s '' american ) make it difficult . basically , the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called `` everytown '' . it spans from 1936 , when a war is on the horizon , to 2036 , when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems . the first one hour is a bit slow - although it 's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought . the events , suspense and visuals are pretty low-key in today 's terms . however , when it gets to the future , it 's just plain fun to watch . the large sets and retro sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat . unless you have great listening abilities , this movie is hard to listen to . i think i understood only 80 % of the dialog . it could use closed-captioning . if you 're a sci-fi fan , this is one of the genre 's classics and is a must see ( well , at least after the first hour ) . for the average viewer , wait until there 's a closed caption version and then watch it if you 're comfortable with movies of this time period .
if you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s ( in l.a. ) then you 've missed a special treat . this is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today 's world in which we live in . it covers everything from raising a child , prejudice ( more than one way ) , love , adultery , empty nest syndrome , selfishness , etc .. and the list goes on . this story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life . it helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life . makes us ask questions of ourselves . have we done enough for others , are we like this , etc. ? ? ? sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that i 'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime . take note of mary mcdonnell , kevin kline and danny glover 's wonderful performance through this whole film . these actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us . these are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now . i still enjoy it again and again . also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and do n't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it 's symbolism for the movie ? ? hmmm ... i almost forgot this is probably steve martin 's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done . he , too does an excellent job in this movie . this may come as a surprise to most of you . sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making .....
off the blocks let me just say that i am a huge zombie fan so i do n't make statements like the above lightly . secondly let me say that this is an italian zombie film and fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to bruno ( rats , night of terror ) mattei . this is no dawn of the dead folks . that said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films i have ever seen . the script is wonderfully horrible . just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ( `` let 's try putting these two molecules together '' ) . the zombies come in all varieties . from moaning shufflers , to machete wielding maniacs , to birds ! the gore is plentiful . legs are bitten off , arms amputated , stomachs burst open . the pace is fast , flying from one zombie attack to the next . then there 's the head in the fridge . oh the head in the fridge ! one of the greatest moments in horror since ash got his hand possessed in evil dead 2 . you should know already whether you 're the sort of person who 's going to like this sort of film . get some mates and some beer and you 'll be in for a fun night . did i mention the head in the fridge ? ! ? ! ?
icy and lethal ace hit-man tony arzenta ( a divinely smooth and commanding performance by alain delon ) wants to quit the assassination business , but the dangerous mobsters he works for wo n't let him . after his wife and child are killed , arzenta declares open season on everyone responsible for their deaths . director duccio tessari relates the absorbing story at a constant snappy pace , maintains a properly serious and no-nonsense tone throughout , stages the stirring shoot-outs and exciting car chases with considerable rip-snorting brio , and punctuates the narrative with jolting outbursts of explosive bloody violence . delon 's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engrossing proceedings . this film further benefits from sterling acting by a bang-up cast , with praiseworthy contributions by richard conte as wise mafia kingpin nick gusto , carla gravini as arzenta 's supportive lady friend sandra , marc porel as arzenta 's loyal pal domenico maggio , anton diffring as ruthless , calculating capo grunwald , and lino troisi as the venomous gangster rocco cutitta . silvano ippoliti 's glossy cinematography boasts several graceful pans . gianni ferrio 's funky score hits the get-down groovy spot . erika blanc and rosalba neri pop up briefly in nifty bit parts . better still , there 's no filler to speak of and we even get a decent dab of tasty gratuitous female nudity . the startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut . a solid and satisfying winner .
if you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film , you will be left with a fantastic comedy . as it is , i still found it to be a pretty good movie , which is no small feat considering the coma i was put in by the opening scenes . to put it mildly , this film has a dreary beginning that was n't even remotely funny , or even upbeat . once things get sillier , however , you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades . definitely worth checking out , especially if you 're a younger fan of lemmon and matthau who wants to see their earlier work .
i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it ! every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting , the script , the direction , and the general feeling of this movie . it 's been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter , reflect from sadness , and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work ! we need more movies like this ! ! ! mike binder : are you listening ? ? ?
soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be . i found the film to have some of the sacarstic , cynical humour like that in paul verhoven 's starship troopers . the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book atmosphere . one particular trivia-bit stands out for me - todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo 'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate . for the oblivious ones out there , tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy batty 's elegiac last lines in blade runner . to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least . maybe script writer david peoples was nostalgic ? i 'll give this one 3 out of 5 .
famous for introducing the world to hedy lamarr and full frontal nudity , but it 's oh so much more . in fact , this is one of the pinnacles of cinematic poetry , up there with some of the seminal works of 1930s art cinema , in the same prestigious group as under the roofs of paris , tabu , olympia , and even l'atalante . it 's nearly a silent , relying mostly on its miraculous images , and also its fantastic , symphonic score by giuseppe becce . it 's a masterpiece of cinematography and music , yes , and also of editing , direction , writing , and acting . a good 90 % of the film moves along perfectly . machatý seems an expert at using motifs . perhaps not as subtle as it could be , and perhaps a bit overused , but the appearances of objects like insects , lights , and horses carry the story forward beautifully . the small snatches of dialogue are , thankfully , unintrusive . they do n't jar as much as one would imagine . the final bit is odd , to say the least . reminiscent of russian silents , we have a montage of workers . this barely makes sense in the course of the narrative , but it 's so gorgeously done that i refuse to harp too much on that flaw . ecstasy is a film that is desperately in need of rediscovery . it belongs amongst the best films ever made .
dominick ( nicky ) luciano wears a 'hulk ' t-shirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man . he uses his physical power in picking up other 's trash and hauling it to the town dump . he reads comic-book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling , going to wrestlemania with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition . he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day . he reads comic books , which he finds in the trash , with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route . unfortunately , dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind . he has a disability . dominick 's disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) . this injury left him slower , though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others . dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film . he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor . dominick provides the main source of income , while eugene is off studying . eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city , and that he must move away from dominick . eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brother . the film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals , families , and then society as a whole . the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky , exploded on their birthday night . eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall . in this moment , eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father , the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse . this event cemented the love between the two brothers , who from then on became the best of friends . though they needed each other , they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others . the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain . however , by the end of the film , dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck . eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independence . when dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma . in this state of extreme stress , dominick almost completely shuts down . he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend . after learning that the boy has died , he is confronted by the abusive father who , fearing his testimonial , tells him he did n't see nothing , does n't know anything , and not to say anything , and that if he does he will kill him . now that his own life has been threatened , he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats . he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint , kidnaps the baby of the grieving family . he runs away from the scene and hides in a building . when the police surround him , eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother . eugene then reveals the cause of dominick 's disability and they bring the baby back . the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick , but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairs . through the climactic ending , the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view . though dominick 's instinct to save the baby can be understood , we also see how damaging this response is . dominick put the baby 's life and his own life in grave danger . the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated , but rather shown through the films ending . despite the more optimistic ending portrayal , another sequence of events might just have likely occurred , in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm . it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted . furthermore , even if dominick is not charged , there may still be a stigma against him within the community , not that there was n't one before these events . instead , the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb it . dominick and eugene was released in 1988 , the same year as another film , rainman , which won 5 academy awards . while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities , it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society . whereas , rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a 'savant ' , if the 'savant ' is the inheritor of a large estate . dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society . the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for 1988 . hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities , not as a threat , but as imperative for the strength of society .
not a bad martial arts film . fight scenes were good . michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme . story worked without foul language and too much blood . screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works . it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre . she likes the art and having strong women promenant . it was definitely worth watching . i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers .
slaughter high starts like any other day at doddsville county high school where little minx carol manning ( caroline munro ) has tricked resident nerd marty rantzen ( simon scuddamore ) into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower , while doing so carol 's gang of friends come in & give the now naked marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an april fool 's day joke . the school 's sports coach ( marc smith ) saves marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame marty , they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face . years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school , they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there . they all venture inside where they quickly learn they are n't the only ones there as marty is back & has revenge on his mind ... originally shot under the title april fool 's day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named april fool 's day ( 1986 ) made the same year this american english co-production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors , george dugdale , mark ezra & peter litten ( after never seeing a film with three credited director 's i 've now seen two in a week the other being the jean-claude van damme flick kickboxer ( 1989 ) ) & i have to say i really rather liked slaughter high even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation . one of the things i like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick , it does n't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules , short comings & trappings & plays up to them . basically it delivers what it promises , a homicidal killer , blood , boobs & babes . i thought the character 's were alright , the story was ok even though it 's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & i actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which slaughter high gets a lot of flak for . the first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another . some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who 's complaining ? despite three credited director 's slaughter high turned out pretty good , i liked the look of the film a lot . the isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good , the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there 's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow carol through various corridors of the rundown school . while not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made . there is some good gore here including burnt bodies , people melted with acid , impalings , stomach explosions , axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain ! the special effects are also better than one would expect & i was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count . technically the film is better than i had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today , i would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though . supposedly set in america this was very obviously shot in england . harry manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from friday the 13th ( 1980 ) & it 's sequels . anyone living here in the uk will probably recognise billy hartman who played frank as a regular in emmerdale farm ( one of our nations top rated soap operas ) in which he plays terry woods ! while most horror fans will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role . legendary exploitation producer dick randall did the deed on slaughter high & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer ... talk about typecasting ! you can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was pieces ( 1982 ) which he also produced behind him in his office . slaughter high is a slasher film that i liked a lot , did you see that ? i did n't say it was great i actually said i liked it on a personal level & i 'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so i ca n't recommend it but i can say i liked it , make of that what you want . make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out . if your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then slaughter high wo n't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this .
i am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film , in the mother . whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film , any comment would much greatly appreciated . the comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam . so if you have any views at all , im sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an a ! i am also studying 'about a boy ' and 'tadpole ' so if you have seen these films as well , i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page . thank you .
directed by samuel fuller , who also wrote the screenplay , pickup on south street is a tough , brutal , well made film about a pickpocket ( richard widmark ) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents . also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover richard kiley . it 's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie . as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties ( and who also sells information ) she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination . its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won . this should have been the role that copped it for her !
i 've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd . to be honest i really do n't know what the problem with it is . it 's a decent murder mystery thriller , shown from various points of view , from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers/suspects , including the late porn king , john holmes . please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie 's plot - i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis . many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really do n't see it . many modern movies were worse - saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie , which often relies on implied blood stains than actual brutal slayings ( the murders depicted in this film were done with lead pipes , afterall ) . i was enthralled with both halves of the movie - the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict , and the second half showing his side as a minor conspirator in a senseless bloodbath . the movie has excellent acting , even though dylan mcdemorant looks more than a bit out of place in his biker-esque personia and goatee'ed bad boy personality . the soundtrack was also awesome - a fantastic mix of 70 's b-side rock and obscure pop , spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights .
a sharp political comment posturing as a coming of age story is what this movie is . the annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels . it is n't supposed to but it does . this tale of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 communist belgrade is a heart warmer . it is what gentlemen refer to as classic cinema . obviously , 1953 belgrade is not as harsh a dictatorial and fascist environment as the communist society is often portrayed . one can listen to rock and roll music , one of the songs played is the song `` hey babu riba '' ala the title of the movie . but jeans can not be bought nor certain drugs which are illegal to possess . unlike a heavy-handed criticism of a communist society this movie does it by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as we four . the girl who has a father in exile in italy and is awaiting a passport for her mother and she to travel out to join him , the piano that is taken away from communion use from one of the boys , the sudden giving of your home and quarters to your new comrades because they need it . the boys spend a lot of time listening to music and it is made clear they despise the fascism that communism has created as they engage in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who has stalin tattooed on his hands . these all leads to the actions they take later on and the remembrance of a time fading away , as this movie was released in 1986 in the twilight of the soviet empire . a great movie worth seeing again and again . `` repentance is not your enemy but yet it is also nobody 's friend . ''
while rehearing carmen of bizet , the middle-aged choreographer antonio ( antonio gades ) brings the sexy carmen ( laura del sol ) to perform the lead role . antonio falls in love for carmen , who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love . when carmen has an affair with another dancer , antonio is consumed by his jealousy like d. josé in the original opera , entwining fiction with reality . `` carmen '' is another great movie of carlos saura 's trilogy dedicated to the flamenco dance . the dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing , and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality ( with the dancers ) or fiction ( of the play ) . paco de lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous bizet 's opera , which is based on the novel of prosper mérimée . my vote is seven . title ( brazil ) : `` carmen ''
originally conceived as a solo vehicle for dudley moore , 'not only ... but also ' saw his ex-'beyond the fringe ' collaborator peter cook guest on the first show , and so well received was it the controller of b.b.c.-2 insisted that he be on it every week from then on . they were a classic comedy team - cook was tall , handsome and witty , while dudley was short , charismatic , and musically gifted . the sketch that brought the house down had them in a pub , wearing flat caps and mufflers , fantasising about movie stars such as jane russell and greta garbo . it remains one of the most hilarious skits of all time , and even when cook corpses it still holds together well . those characters - idiot pete and even-bigger idiot dud - found their way into every episode of the show proper , seen in a different setting , such as a zoo or an art gallery . in the latter , they munched sandwiches while discussing works of art . `` that leonardo davinci cartoon ... i do n't see the joke ! `` , says dud . pete points out that when it was first unveiled it probably had people in fits . dud nearly chokes on his repast . `` you really are enjoying those sandwiches ! `` , ad libs cook . the pair bounced their humour off each other in a way that was joyous to behold . the sketches themselves set new standards for comedy , standards that would not be matched until the arrival of 'monty python ' . as the show 's popularity increased , so did the quality of the guest stars . peter sellers for instance , and john lennon , the latter presenting a filmed item based on his poem 'deaf ted , danoota , & me ' . 'one leg too few ' - had dud as 'george spigott ' ( a name later re-used in the film 'bedazzled ' ) , a one-legged man , who hops into the office of film producer cook to audition for the role of 'tarzan ' . cook tries to let him down as best as he can . `` i 've nothing against your right leg ! `` , he says . `` the trouble is - neither have you ! '' . dud would on occasion interview the eccentric sir arthur streeb-greebling ( cook ) , who when he was not teaching ravens to fly underwater , was planning on opening a restaurant called 'the frog & the peach ' . another classic was 'the leaping nuns ' ( also reused in 'bedazzled ' ) . but my all-time favourite has to be 'superthunderstingcar ' , a wickedly funny ( and accurate ) parody of gerry and sylvia anderson 's 'thunderbirds ' . pete and dud played all the roles , with the latter making a fetching 'lady penelope ' . 'ludwig ' had ludwig van beethoven as the star of a 'this is tom jones ' style variety show . 'the immortal bargo ' was a spoof documentary on the life of reclusive movie star 'emma bargo ' . in an unforgettable moment , she drove through london , bellowing through a loudhailer : `` i want to be alone ! '' . a season 3 feature was 'poets cornered ' with the likes of ronnie barker , spike milligan , barry humphries , willie rushton and others suspended over a gunge tank . they each had to improvise the line of a poem , and anyone failing to make it rhyme wound up in the nasty stuff . three seasons were made in all , produced ( at different times ) by joe mcgrath , dick clement and jimmy gilbert . sadly very few editions survive . to make matters worse , the scripts were destroyed as well . it beggars belief that this situation was allowed to happen . the show ended in 1970 . the comics then hit broadway , made the infamous 'derek & clive ' tapes , but cook 's ever-increasing alcoholism broke them apart . eight years later , cook announced that a new series was in the offing , but it turned out to be wishful thinking on his part . his ex-partner was making films in america , and had no intention of working with cook again ( not at that time anyway ) . enough footage was scraped together for a season of b.b.c.-2 repeats in the early '90 's . as expected , some items had not held up as well as others . cook died in 1995 , and by way of a tribute the b.b.c put together a programme compiled from various 'parkinson ' interviews and 'not only ... but also ' shows . it ended rather appropriately with pete and dud finding themselves in heaven . `` bloody hell ! `` , exclaimed the latter . moore passed on in 2002 .
spirit : stallion of the cimarron is an overall wonderful movie . the blending of animation types is unique , the storyline is amazing , and the music is wonderful . the drawn animation is a special thing about many animations . how they expressed the characters , especially the horses , through their animation are spectacular especially . while the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand , many young children and people who have n't studied horses might not understand . without words , i would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features . because of this , i understand the 'eyebrow ' they added to the horses ( while real horses do n't have those thick lines ) . one of the few things i noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that spirit lead his mother 's herd . in wild horse herds , the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out . also , while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the 'bad guys ' is stereotyping , think of all the movies in which the native americans have been portrayed as that . sometimes back then ; they did treat mustangs very poorly . for example , in real history , the appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the army officers . imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the native americans had not saved them . i think it 's amazing how the realism was n't subtracted by making the horses talk to each other . spirit 's feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration , but mostly through the music ( by bryan adams ) . the songs express the story really well , and hans zimmer and bryan adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics . the emotion i got when watching the movie , whether the first time or the twentieth ( yes , i 've watched it that much ) , you would n't believe . some of the scenes take your breath away , while others seem to force tears into your eyes . the opening sequence , showing spirit 's homeland , puts you right into the spectacular action right away . i do n't understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie . overall , i rate it a 10/10 - a must watch .
i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise . i did n't cared much about tom cruise 's acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie ... not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character .... they merge and then speak and its beautiful . however i must say this movie does n't come under the `` average flick of weekend '' which you pick at random and watch gleefully ; it carries strong sentiments and characters so do n't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns . it certainly needs more than that .
witty and disgusting . brash and intelligent . baseketball redefines comedy/sports with a pot spoof of an easy target . makes other so called comedies like dead boring . one of the best of all time ! trey parker and matt stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection .
in a year of pretentious muck like `` synecdoche , new york '' a film born out of charlie kaufman 's own self-indulgence , comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important . `` frownland '' is a labor of love by the crew , the actors and the filmmaker , shot over years by friends . it traces a man who can not communicate through his thoroughly authentic , real brooklyn world . the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the `` mumblecore '' movement . they are real people , painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses , unwilling to change , unable . the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch , it is very difficult to watch . it is 16mm film-making without proper light , money or any of the other factors that would make a film `` slick '' , but its honesty can not be understated , a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw . this does remind of films like `` naked '' or the best of the `` mumblecore '' . it is a film that is not for everyone , but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it .
a bit slow ( somehow like a sofia coppola movie ) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls . the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age . the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life . the music is perfect and the acting is amazing . the camera works beautifully also . i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires . i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period . so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities .
recently when i was shopping , i saw the box-set of americian gothic , and i thought ' i remember that ! ' i used to set my alarm to get back up & watch this when it was on ch 4 in 1996 at 1.30am ( i was 14 ) . i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird , no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck ( with a b ! ! ) no one ever was anyway . what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box-set as when on tv . episodes in funny order , i kept thinking when does dr matt leave ? ? ? - they made it so confusing . however this is not the writers , producers or directors fault ( its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same - just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they do n't like originality in studios ! ! ! ! ! ) to finish - if you 've not seen this and you call yourself a sci-fi fantasy , horror , supernatural drama .. fan = you must . they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box-set .
chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a ` jack-the-stripper ' type of list of murdered people : he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results . perhaps mostly due to stephen rea 's excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both . it was the playing of these two parts  above all  which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov . supporting actors , especially max von sydow , carried out their parts really well . good directing . the photography was good too . needless to say , the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations , but , frankly , given the depth of the story-telling and interpretations , we can completely forget these little trivialia . for once , a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps . recommended , especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes  which , i hasten to add , are never exaggerated .
very few movies have had the impact on american culture the way urban cowboy has . thank god it was temporary . but uc is almost in a class by itself as one of those flicks that when you 're flipping channels at 3:00am you just ca n't take your eyes off .... my top three are animal house and walking tall btw but that 's beside the point . i remember urban cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner , men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers , and if you didnt know how to two-step you were considered a social moron ! personally i think it 's a great movie . travolta really surprised me on the heels of satnitefever . who 'd a thunk . he 's actually believable too . the soundtrack is awesome . too bad charlene tilton , of tv 's dallas fame ruined johnny lee 's career cause that guy was just terrific . the show stealer here is scott glenn as the greaser ex-con redneck cowboy . and i ai n't got nothing against greaser ex-con cowboys semi-being one myself , but i 've always envied what i feel to be the greatest power line of all time .... '' pack-at s * # t ! '' sort of like clint 's `` make my day . '' and watching him slap sissy around is the closest thing i 'll see to my julia roberts fantasy so ..... like i said , beautiful . 9/10
errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l. sullivan ( ward bond ) went around claiming that he `` could beat any man alive . '' both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen . raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style , capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor . all the warner contract players make up the fine cast -- including the always reliable alan hale as flynn 's rambunctious father , proud of his son 's fighting abilities , and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners . all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b & w , although it 's too bad warners did n't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color . he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time , engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out . the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen , with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action . and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward 's finest moments in a long career as a character actor . summing up : maintains interest all the way through , whether you 're a sports fan or not .
this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time . soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful . soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore . abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming future . the ending of the movie is very different from most movies . in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms , you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie . otherwise , it would have been gross injustice to everyone . the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court . her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness . slowly slowly , over the time , he falls in love for her . it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not . watch the movie for complete details . the movie really belongs to abhay . i look forward to seeing more movies from him . soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie . her eyes , her innocence did most of the talking .
i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old slovenian movies seemed to have in them ... well , in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia . or did that `` feeling '' decide to pack its bags and say `` goodbye '' somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history , and then never came back ? or did it ? because for me , it came back the first time i saw `` ekspres , ekspres '' . and it was it 's old self again . there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story , the warmth of the colors and , what i appreciated the most - the lack of excessive use of verbal communication ( something many of other ( not just ) slovenian screenwriters should at least consider ) . there is no use for words , when you can understand each other just as well ( yeah , or better ) by other means in use . just watch bakovic and cerar . uh . so this , in only so many words , is why i would recommend `` ekspres , ekspres '' to all of you , as a must-see slovenian movie , regardless of what you may heard of slovenian films ( if you ever even heard anything , that is ... ) . oh , and that scene , where bakovic is dancing to vivaldi 's music ... a treat . treat yourself . watch it .
when a stiff turns up with pneumonic plague ( a variant of bubonic plague ) , u.s. public health service official dr. clinton reed ( richard widmark ) immediately quarantines everyone whom he knows was near the body . unfortunately , the stiff got that way by being murdered , and there 's a good chance that the murderer will start spreading the plague , leading to an epidemic . enter police captain tom warren ( paul douglas ) , who is enlisted to track down the murderer as soon as possible and avert a possible national disaster . while panic in the streets is a quality film , it suffers from being slightly unfocused and a bit too sprawling ( my reason for bringing the score down to an eight ) . it wanders the genres from noirish gangster to medical disaster , police procedural , thriller and even romance . this is not director elia kazan 's best work , but saying that is a bit disingenuous . kazan is the helmer responsible such masterpieces as a streetcar named desire ( 1951 ) , on the waterfront ( 1954 ) and east of eden ( 1955 ) , after all . this film predates those , but kazan has said that he was already `` untethered '' by the studio . taking that freedom too far may partially account for the sprawl . the film is set in new orleans , a city where kazan `` used to wander around . . . night and day so i knew it well '' . he wanted to exploit the environment . `` it 's so terrific and colorful . i wanted boats , steam engines , warehouses , jazz joints -- all of new orleans '' . kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well , but they could be connected better . the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods . the sprawl in terms of setting would have still worked . part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to merge two stories by writers edna and edward anhalt , `` quarantine '' and `` some like 'em cold '' . the gangster material , which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film , is probably the highlight . not surprisingly , kazan has said that he believes the villains are `` more colorful -- i never had much affection for the good guys anyway . i do n't like puritans '' . a close second is the only material that approaches the `` panic '' of the title -- the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed , inoculate them and contain the disease . while there is plenty of suspense during these two `` moods '' , much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama , with pacing more typical of that genre . the dialogue throughout is excellent . the stylistic difference to many modern films could hardly be more pronounced . it is intelligent , delivered quickly and well enunciated by each character . conflict is n't created by `` dumb '' decisions but smart moves ; events and characters ' actions are more like a chess game . when unusual stances are taken , such as reed withholding the plague from the newspapers , he gives relatively lengthy justifications for his decisions , which other characters argue over . in light of this , it 's interesting that kazan believed that `` propriety , religion , ethics and the middle class are all murdering us '' . that idea works its way into the film through the alterations to the norm , or allowances away from it , made by the protagonists . for example , head gangster blackie ( jack palance in his first film role ) is offered a `` get out of jail free '' card if he 'll cooperate with combating the plague . the technical aspects of the film are fine , if nothing exceptional , but the real reasons to watch are the performances , the intriguing scenario and the well-written dialogue .
first things first , the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed . now actress wang zu xian , the one who played xiao qian in the movie , is 42 years old and well aged . it 's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old-school hongkong productions like this . the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s . the art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing . more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it . it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it 's not scaring , but only fun . i had the experience of translating the second script of `` a chinese ghotst story '' , and i thought that script was a decent write . however when i saw the movie , i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script , like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles . however , it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining . if you have seen the lord of the rings , you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr . the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch . it 's definitely a laugh-out-loud . bravo !
good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds . lots of tough guys throughout ; cobern 's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type . several holes appeared in the picture , but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing . one really dumb scene shows heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire . a . to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo . b . the grass was obviously dry : why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip ?
this is the best movie i have ever seen . i 've seen the movie on dutch television sometime in 1988 ( ? ) . that month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday night . the next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which i do n't remember . if you know it , please let me know ! in any case , how can i get to see this movie again ? ? ? ? a dvd of this movie , where ? ? please tell me at vannoord @ let.rug.nl the next week there was another great movie ( involving a train , rather than a bus ) the name of which i do n't remember . if you know it , please let me know ! in any case , how can i get to see this movie again ? ? ? ? a dvd of this movie , where ? ? please tell me at vannoord @ let.rug.nl
this movie is totally wicked ! it 's really great to see mjh in a different role than her sabrina character ! the plot is totally cool , and the characters are excellently written . definitely one of the best movies ! !
well here comes another , well , romantic comedy ... but unlike all others movies of this genre , this is by far the best i have seen in a long while .. i 'll admit , at first i wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox , and a little because of simon pegg ... first of all , if you have watched a decent amount of movies , you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie , one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you wo n't know how ... okay , now this movie is just made for simon pegg.i ca n't see any other actor in the role of sidney , and i 'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for pegg 's great performance . there is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard , courtesy of simon pegg 's character sidney ... but i think everyone in this movie is good.for example , kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie ( i usually do n't think of her as any more than an average actress , but she was really good in this one ) , then there 's jeff bridges , there 's gillian anderson , and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes ... great role for her ... all in all , while i usually do n't agree with ratings her on imdb , this time i would completely agree with them ... go and see this movie , it is really light-hearted and positive , and i recommend it deeply ... my rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
and gi joe go stuck in the water , i die of laufther every time i see this movie , and then a big brown shark came , this is comedy at it 's best , this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else , andrew dice clay , jerry , tucker , rock , they ca n't thouch the man the myth the legend eddie murphy , yo eddie we want more more more more more more more ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
to those who have not followed the anne marie fahey murder case . you are missing out one of the saddest yet complicated murder of all . the murderer is popular delaware attorney , tom capano and the victim is the delaware governor 's scheduling secretary , anne marie fahey . their relationship was a well-kept secret until her disappearance and murder . she wanted to leave him but he just would n't let her go so easily . on the other hand , he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters . where did he find the time to have two mistresses and a domestic family life ? besides , the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four hour mini series . while the actress who plays ms. fahey does a fine job , she does not have her dark long hair . his other mistress is definitely more attractive than the actual woman . mark harmon is better looking and does an emmy award winning performance as tom capano . it would be better with actual delaware and philadelphia locations . with ann rule 's executive producing , she adds accuracy to anne marie 's characteristic of organization and her personal battle with an eating disorder . these bits of information might be overlooked by any other executive producer or director . if you have not read the book , it is well worth it . ann rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime . it is ironic that mark harmon plays tom capano . he also played ann rule 's former friend and subject , ted bundy in an another book adaptation many years ago . he was brilliant then and now . he does an above average job with an amazing story . even president clinton offered his assistance in the anne marie fahey case . and now , the former governor tom carper is now the united states senator for delaware who defeated longtime , popular incumbent senator richard roth in the november 2000 election . if you do n't think the movie is interesting , then the read rule 's book .
i 've just purchased the restored version of a film that i remember with much affection from childhood and it 's certainly made for a curious afternoon 's entertainment . bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its complete form , the deleted scenes ( especially those with mcdowall ) link events together quite neatly . what is a little disconcerting is the way the scenes have been remastered . clearly , the soundtrack to this footage had been lost or damaged , so some bright spark at disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogue . which would have been great except that half the cast were n't around to do it ( some for better reasons than others ) and the whole thing has a rather shoddy quality to it . some of the lip-synching is pretty poor , and david tomlinson 's voice has been dubbed by a bloke who sounds absolutely nothing like david tomlinson ( there 's actually a hint of german in it , i think ) . however , good to hear the full versions of all the songs ( although 'step in the right direction ' is still absent ) and the moments of magic in this film still shine through . and i challenge you not to giggle when young paul gazes so innocently at angela lansbury and coos `` but what 's that got to do with my knob ? ? ''
i have always been a fan of david lynch and with this film lynch proved to critics that he has the talent , style , and artistic integrity to make films outside of the surreal aura that he 's become known for in the past decade . as much as the film is g-rated , it 's pure lynch in style , pacing , and tone . the film moves at a masterfully hypnotic pace and is filled with scenes of genuine emotion and power . the cinematography is terrific , as is to be expected from a lynch film , and the transitional montage sequences are breathtaking . it 's also very refreshing to see a film where the characters are all friendly , kindhearted folk and not unmotivated characters that are clearly labeled as being either `` good '' or `` evil '' . richard farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast , most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daugher , and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial role . with this film , david lynch proved to critics that he could make a powerful moving motion picture just like he did in the 80 's with 'blue velvet ' and 'the elephant man ' . critics seemed to lose faith in the past decade after he produced such surreal films as 'twin peaks : fire walk with me ' and 'lost highway ' but with this film he showed that there was method to fwwm and lh , and it looks as if critics finally caught on with his recent film 'mulholland drive ' , considering the high praise it 's received and the oscar nomination for lynch . 'straight story ' is to me one of the most moving motion pictures i 've ever seen . it 's a loving story about family , friendship , and the kindness of strangers . i would highly recommend it .
billed as takashi miike 's `` first family film '' - by people who have n't seen zebraman , presumably . yokai daisenso takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness , diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale . a young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware . the film is evidently bigger budget than anything else miike has done , with lots of cgi to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures ( the yokai ) . perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors , but i think it 's probably just that he wanted to do something different . he 's really never been a one-trick pony , but often gets accused of it - perhaps yokai is designed to silence those critics . regardless , it 's a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into . there 's a very cartoonish feel to the production , evoking thoughts of miyazaki in places . the yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on japanese folk tales , which certainly influenced miyazaki as well ( particularly spirited away ) . it must remembered that miike has nothing like the budget of a harry potter film to work with , so the special effects are n't going to be seamless hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious . some of the special effects are great though , with some very well animated creatures ( a mix of cg , stop-motion and puppetry ) . i think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was * meant * to look really cheap , and is all the cuter for it : ) the young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it 's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting , but 9 year old ryunosuke kamiki is a genuine talent ( i see he did voices in the last 2 miyazaki films ! ) . chiaki kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece , though mai takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared river princess - yum yum ! those looking for another violent , perverted gangster film are n't going to find what they 're looking for in yokai , but if you 're a fan of miike because of his imagination and wit , there 's plenty to satisfy here . and it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you 've got : )
i did n't have many expectation going into the film , but i thought it was fantastic . pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role . he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor . pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great , and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time . the humor is dark , the performances by brosnan , kinnear , and hope davis are great , mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship , and you have a great film . this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time . this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-bond era of brosnan 's career .
i really liked this summerslam due to the look of the arena , the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason . anyways , this could have been one of the best summerslam 's ever if the wwf did n't have lex luger in the main event against yokozuna , now for it 's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but i 'm glad times have changed . it was a terrible main event just like every match luger is in is terrible . other matches on the card were razor ramon vs ted dibiase , steiner brothers vs heavenly bodies , shawn michaels vs curt hening , this was the event where shawn named his big monster of a body guard diesel , irs vs 1-2-3 kid , bret hart first takes on doink then takes on jerry lawler and stuff with the harts and lawler was always very interesting , then ludvig borga destroyed marty jannetty , undertaker took on giant gonzalez in another terrible match , the smoking gunns and tatanka took on bam bam bigelow and the headshrinkers , and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending . however it deserves 8/10
there 's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship , stuff he dare not dream about . as doctor edward morbius , pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier . since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter , anne francis . they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell . the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin . the machinery they left behind is still functioning . maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion . i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it 's as fresh as it was in 1956 . the terms would change , we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive , courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek . we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship . it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey . it 's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change . the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one , about mortal beings trying to play god . you ca n't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot . this mechanical marvel , put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day . he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space . his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl 's request for some home spirits are very funny . robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar , but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea . forbidden planet 's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille . classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare 's one venture into science fiction . my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who 's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he 's dealing with . never miss this one whenever it 's broadcast .
i think that that creator ( s ) of this film 's concept deserves a lot more accolades than they probably ever received . it is n't an oscar caliber film of course , but , at least for me , this film has left a lasting impression since i first saw it back in 1984 ( in the theatre ) . i do n't think this is ( and hope it is n't ) a spoiler , but : imagine acting on your impulses . doing the first thought that pops into your head , saying the first words on your lips ... no restraint , no conscious , nothing holding you back from saying or doing the things that , as intelligent adults , we know we should n't actually say or do . if anything , this film only scratches the surface - it does n't go as far as it could go . in a time when hollywood seems obsessed with remaking older `` classics '' to try and cash in on today , would n't it be nice to see them remake an older film of modest success , for the sake of taking it to the next level ? a bit further , or even to explore what the original crew did n't , would n't or could n't deal with 20 years ago ? that 's just my opinion anyway . : o )
this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast ... i mean best ! the story ( co-written by cassandra peterson , elvira 's alter ego ) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira 's wit and charm . the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell , massachusetts ( where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna 's will ) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council . she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding , the owner of the local cinema , and another woman ( patty ) who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira . and , later in the movie , she also faces the complications of being descended from `` a major metaphysical celebrity '' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake . elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable , streetwise and naive in this film , while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings . this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams . in the end elvira 's dreams finally come true , which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman . i 've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it ! there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie . a review will not do justice to the actual movie , so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made ! meanwhile , i wish you `` unpleasant dreams ! ''
i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the rating 's some people have given it . it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated , now if you do n't like comic books or animation then of course you wo n't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me . though , if you are a fan of interesting , strong characters and heroic ( sexy ) women kicking butt and saving the world ( hell ) you will love this movie . i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie . quite anime-esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation . like titan a.e . meet 's the live action version of punisher . in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie .
bette midler is indescribable in this concert . she gives her all every time she is on stage . whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads , bette midler moves her audience . if you ca n't see it live ( which is the best way to see bette ) then this is the next best thing . an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power . her more `` vocally correct '' version of `` stay with me '' never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness , here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever . i will treasure this concert for a very long time .
in arlington heights , il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools ( 1961 ) so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game . true , i was 11 , but i thought it was the greatest thing on ! i 'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it . i also remember winning wonderful cars ( pontiac or oldsmobile ) if the contestant got the final hidden picture game . i even had the home version ! i wonder why this game lasted so briefly . i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures - the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream . really good memories are connected with camouflage .
i watched this flick yesterday and i have to say it 's the finest horror film made for $ 36,000 i 've ever seen ( sorry steckler ) the film is definitely worth seeking out if you are a zombie fan . this movie reeks of soul and atmosphere . some of the shots of the zombs are the best ever committed to film . very creepy looking dusty webbed corpses slowly shamble to their screaming victims . brrrrrrr . hot saggy canadian women with sexy accents will keep you preoccupied before the horror rears its undead corpse eating head . this film entertained from start to finish . i could n't ask for more than that . my only complaint is that is was too short .
this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye . ill never forget my experience watching it . i do n't understand why people do n't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull , pacino in scarface , and crowe in gladiator combined . this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it . whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough , gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi-jinx ensues to say the least . by the way i 'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage .
i grew up in southern west virginia ; i 'm about the same age as ( or maybe a year older than ) homer hickam , author of `` the rocket boys , '' the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming film . and so i relate closely to the west virginia coal-mining theme , and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time ( october 4 , 1957 ) on all of us . the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves . i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering . all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the `` science gap '' the u.s.s.r. had on the u.s. in those cold war days ... this is a wonderful film for everyone , of all ages . but if you grew up in west virginia in the late 1950 's , it 'll touch the core of your being . everyone : get it ; watch it ; recommend it to your friends ... who 'll thank you many times .
for someone who remembers jane in the daily mirror strip cartoon , viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia . in that context it is wonderful , but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters . the plotline is also a bit limp for today 's audience , but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well . jane , you must remember , was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years , created to boost the morale of the troops . she gave a double meaning to the `` strip '' in strip cartoon . the story has something in common with the tales of edgar rice burroughs and rider haggard . the theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era , a bunch of bumbling nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling englanders , and set in the african jungle of course . for jane fans , a must see . for the rest of you , a damp squib .
demonicus is a movie turned into a video game ! i just love the story and the things that goes on in the film.it is a b-film ofcourse but that doesn ` t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad ! horror and sword fight freaks , buy this movie now !
fascist principal miss togar ( mary woronov , who is lensed by expert photographer dean cundy as if she were ten feet tall ) has a plan to turn her high completely square . complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller riff randell ( pj soles who lights up the screen -- she 's got a hot bod , too ) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band the ramones . pal kate rambeau ( dey young , whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty ) joins forces with riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is togar 's desired mission . vincent van patten has a hilarious role as tom roberts , a success at everything , but getting laid . kate is crazy about tom .. if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it . clint howard steals the film almost ( honestly , who can steal this film away from soles ? ) as eaglebauer , `` the supplier '' who can get everyone almost anything . his office is located in the boy 's restroom ! paul bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of riff 's when he enjoys a concert of the ramones . a raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy .. and i loved it . it 's like someone just says , `` let 's make life fun for 1½ hours . '' the film really is anarchy .. a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring the ramones with all it 's heart ( even if they are horrible actors , they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film ) . the ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole .. riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins . to be honest , i did n't want the party to end ! not conventional in any way whatsoever , this film just let 's loose a frenzy . accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of the ramones best songs , this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war did n't dominate headlines and people just had a good time . those , i guess were the days .
i was hardly aware of the time in history depicted in this 1971 brazilian black comedy , however that is not to say it was n't accessible to me because the movie makes it very clear . it 's set in 16th century brazil , where rival french and portuguese settlers are exploiting the indigineous people as confederates in their battle to assert dominance . what is particularly interesting about the movie is that it is made by the portuguese from the point of view of the french . the hero is a likable frenchman , the portuguese are barbarians , and the rest of the french are oppressive and greedy . the film 's portuguese makers are objective because when all is said and done , we see that it makes no difference whose side one takes . it 's about heredity overpowered by environment in a time starkly defined by tribes . enemies are made and perpetuated , and like so , the environmental integration never progresses . a frenchman is captured by the portuguese is then captured by an indigenous tribe , the tupinambas , after they massacre a group of portuguese . the tribe 's shaman predicted they would find a strong portuguese man to cannibalize as revenge for the chief 's brother being killed by a portugeuse musket ball . thinking the frenchman is portuguese , they believe they now have one . nevertheless , the frenchman is granted unrestrained course of the village , is sooner or later given a wife , and assumes their accustomed appearance rather than his western clothes , or any clothes . another frenchman comes to the village and tells the tribe that their prisoner is indeed portuguese , then assures the incensed frenchman that he will tell them the truth when the frenchman finds a secret treasure trove that another european has hidden nearby . i found the opening scene funny , because its narration apposed with its contradictions on- screen serve as great satire , even if the movie did n't seem to want to maintain that tone very much more often . it 's actually not a terribly riveting film . the bountiful , essential locale , fierce way of life and ripened native women make not only the frenchman , but us , too , forget any threat , and we have the feeling of him as a free man . it should not be that terribly hard to escape . the cannibalism is as scarce of desire as the full-frontal nudity of the cast , suggested in lieu as the representative core of pereira dos santos 's dry political cartoon of new world mythology and undeveloped social coherence . at any rate , this 1500s-era social commentary , shot on location at a bay with 365 islands , played almost entirely nude and almost entirely written in tupi , encourages effective breakdown of established ways which are topical because they 've repeated themselves for centuries .
this is undeniably the scariest game i 've ever played . it 's not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps ( which i usually do n't care much for ) , but the acceptable gfx , interesting weapons and magic , great surround soundeffects ( `` scryeeee , scryeeee .. '' ) and above all incredible atmosphere . i love the scrye , which enables you , at certain places in the games , to see or hear events that happened there in the past . the only game i 've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere . i 'm a great horror fan , escpecially of clive barker 's stories and movies , and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story . 9/10 ( -1 because i 'm no fps fan , and perhaps the game was a bit short ? )
talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - peter ustinov and maggie smith - together - in `` hot millions , '' a funny , quirky comedy also starring karl malden , robert morley , and bob newhart . ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer ( morley ) and takes a position in a firm run by malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind . it 's not smooth sailing ; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company , played by newhart , and his neighbor , maggie smith ( who knows him at their place of residence under another name ) , becomes his secretary for a brief period . she ca n't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired . when newhart makes advances to her , she invites ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up , but the two soon decide they 're made for each other . of course , she does n't know ustinov is a crook . this is such a good movie - you ca n't help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by ustinov 's machinations , his genius , and the ways he slithers out of trouble . but there 's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains . do n't miss this movie , set in '60s london . it 's worth if it only to hear maggie smith whine , `` i 've been sacked . ''
to a certain extent , i actually liked this film better than the original vampires . i found that movie to be quite misogynistic . as a woman and a horror fan , i 'm used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre . but they just slap sheryl lee around way too much . in this movie , natasha wagner is a more fully-realized character , and the main bad guy is a gal ! arly jover ( who played a sidekick vamp in blade ) is very otherworldly and deadly . jon bon jovi ... okay , yeah , no great actor , but he does ok. at least he does n't start to sing . catch it on cable if you can . it 's on encore action this month .
written and directed by steve gordon . running time : 97 minutes . classified pg . it was the quintessential comedy of the decade . it won sir john gielgud the academy award . it was even featured in vh1 's `` i love the 80 's . '' and it looks just as good today as it did upon it 's initial release . arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire ( played with enthusiasm and wit by dudley moore in an oscar-nominated performance ) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he 's grown accustomed to . while the basic plot is one big cliche , there 's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce . arthur bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk , but you ca n't help but like him . especially when he delivers lines such as , `` do n't you wish you were me ? i know i do ! '' he 's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero : unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen , he 's not ashamed of being filthy rich . in one scene , a man asks him , `` what does it feel like to have all that money ? , '' to which he responds , `` it feels great . '' moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience . and gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant , addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him . arthur is one of those movies that does n't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional : it just comes naturally . the screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue . this is the kind of movie that , when together with a bunch of poker buddies , you quote endlessly to one another . it also looks at its characters with sincere empathy . there have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star ( including both grumpy old men 's ) , but few can carry it off because we just do n't care . when this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler , it actually works , because we genuinely like these people . why should you see arthur ? the answer is simple : because it 's an all-around , non-guilty pleasure . at a period in which films are becoming more and more serious , arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time . * * * * - classic
etienne girardot is just a character actor -- the sort of person people almost never would know by name . however , he once again plays the coroner -- one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once . i 've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air . this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot , there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride -- including grant mitchell , gene lockhart , henry walthal , kent smith , h.b . warner and nat pendleton . this is quite an impressive cast , and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce . these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b-movies . while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific , because of the breezy writing and acting , the films really satisfy . as for this film , vance is played wonderfully by lowe but , like i said , the mystery itself is only an after-thought -- with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides . unfortunately , you can not hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort -- i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film , i would have done it ! used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets ! ! overall , while not the best philo vance film , it was very good and it 's a darn shame lowe only played this role once . in fact , aside from william powell ( who played vance five times ) , the series was hindered by a long , long succession of actors such as basil rathbone , wilfred hyde-white and warren william ( and many others ) playing vance . this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series -- just too many different actors playing the leading man . well worth seeing and exciting -- though also quite impossible .
the first one meant victory . this one means defeat . it takes place in a bolivia , there the guerillas are sick and wary and do n't meet that much sympathy from the farmers . if you know your 60s history , you understand how it ends . you will understand it even without that knowledge . del toro is once again splendid . he goes on building this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same , regardless of success or failure . that 's what guevara is according to the legend , but still it 's so well acted . the documentary feeling is there around the icon , which is one of the greatest achievements in this big soderbergh project . he has succeeded .
when you start watching this animation-masterpiece , you quickly notice , that it 's a european production . although the europeans have ( sadly ) integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an american production of this kind , most are missing . one of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our ( very few and very unlikely ) heroes can vanquish . another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money , is greedy , runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature . this movie would have been better off without both . the movie is based upon a tv-series that was out four years before the movie . unlike the movie , the tv-series is a cartoon and not a computer animation . at first i thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but i was quickliy convinced : whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff ! although the characters are obviously fictional ( in stills they do n't even look real ) , they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest . making characters who by `` normal '' standards could be considered deformed ( those micro-legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump ) so alive and lovable is more than `` just a highlight '' ! the creation of the world is another masterpiece . not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it . the world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air . when a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground , it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight . in some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere . although the world of floating islands is completely surreal , in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it does n't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in new york . i wrote that the looks of the world are n't as breathtaking as the idea . as true as that might be to my mind , the quality of the world , the characters and the attention to details is staggering . although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes , emotions can be read as clearly as in sean connery 's or dustin hoffman 's face . the world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike . the background is always in motion , something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive . if you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find . the existence of hector actually puts the cherry on top . hector is a furry little `` thing '' ( possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world ) who is totally lovable and extremely funny . although he is n't really important for the main plot , he would be missed like scrat would be in ice age . the really cool thing about hector is that you need to speak gibberish to understand him . if the movie is so great , why did n't i give it 10 stars ? well , the plot in itself was rather thin . two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world , is n't really original . that in itself would n't be much of a problem . what i missed was the background information . what kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way ? i love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth . another thing i did n't like was zoé . although a little girl like her could be considered adorable , she was somewhat of a pain in this movie . she seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality , kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down . she would have been ok if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie - or had been less of a girly to start with . to me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers . all in all , this is a really good movie for just about all ages .
ah , a kelly/sinatra sailor-suit musical . so familiar , right ? yes , but this is n't the one you usually hear about . on the town 's that-a-way . but if you stick around , you might learn something . okay , probably not . anyway , anchors aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three- or four-day leave . joe is the `` sea wolf '' and clarence , the bookish type , begs joe to get him a `` dame '' . now , after they 're picked up by the coppers they get little donald home . that 's where they meet susie , that temptress , that jezebel . just kidding ! clarence falls in love with her . at least he thinks he does . is he right ? or is he a moron ? or is he just misguided by society ? find out all this and more when you watch { trumpet fanfare } anchors aweigh ! p.s . if you want to see kathryn grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet , try kiss me kate ( 1953 ) .
while traveling by train through europe , the american jesse ( ethan hawke ) and the french celine ( julie delpy ) meet each other and decide to spend the night together in austria . on the next morning , jesse returns to united states of america , and celine to paris . `` before sunrise '' is one of my favorite romances , indeed one of the most beautiful love stories i have ever seen . it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline , but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect , and the dialogs are stunning . the direction is amazing , transmitting the feelings of celine and jesse to the viewer . i have just completed my review number 1,000 in imdb , and i choose `` before sunrise '' for this significant number because it is a very special film for me . i can not understand why this movie was not nominated to the oscar , with such a magnificent screenplay , direction and performances . yesterday i have probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time , and i still love it . my vote is ten . title ( brazil ) : `` antes do amanhecer '' ( `` before sunrise '' )
writer/director/co-star adam jones is headed for great things . that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film `` cross eyed '' . rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did . cleverly written and masterfully directed , `` cross eyed '' keeps you involved from beginning to end . adam jones may not be a well known name yet , but he will be . if this movie had one or two `` named actors '' it would be a box office sensation . i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie . regardless of where it ends up , if you get a chance to see it you wo n't be disappointed .
for a film that got little publicity , and few people have heard about , this was pretty good . it 's another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky ( `` snatch , '' `` sexy beast , '' etc. ) . it 's not wild like `` snatch '' but it 's interesting and it has some rough characters . it also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer . basically , it 's about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian `` mail order bride '' who winds up , with the aid of two russian male friends , providing a couple of big surprises . ben chapin and nicole kidman co-star , and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as kidman 's russian cohorts . this is a different kind of film and well-acted . kidman once again proves she 's far more than just a beautiful face .
the film adaptation of james joyce 's ulysses is excellent . the actors , the voice overs , the direction , it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits . the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom , the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly . i absolutely love this picture .
this afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw neil gaimans stardust and all i can say is wow . it is rare that i am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie i have ever seen , maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all neil gaiman 's fault . sure , i could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart , flowed smoothly , and made the characters completely believable . i could go on for days about the spectacular acting , charlie cox is perfect as tristan , claire daines is brilliant as yvaine , and robert di nero almost steals the movie as the deeply in the closet pirate captian shakespeare . the pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be laugh our loud funny , intelligent enough to make the first shrek look like an 80 's sitcom , and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie . special effects were near perfect , true this was no lotr or star wars sf extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for , not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly . then there is the story ? what can i say . how often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that does n't just come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff . it manages to be familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time . any one of those things would have made this a good movie , all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well . once again neil gaiman has done it , he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that i would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it . i did n't want it to end , i wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of stormhold and get to meet tristan and yvaine in person , to travel it 's fields and valleys , stroll through it 's marketplaces and meet it 's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever . it is a feeling that i have noticed whenever i have read anything by gaiman , the sandman , american gods , coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when i finished reading them because it was over , i could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one i am forced to live in and watching stardust was no different . in the end i 'm sure that neil 's writing and this movie wo n't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when i say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie , it is easily one of the top 5 movies i have ever seen and i can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it .
every once in a while , eddie murphy will surprise you . in a movie like `` the golden child '' , especially . this is a movie you 'd figure would star maybe harrison ford or kurt russell or someone . but eddie really does work ; he 's smart , he 's funny , he 's brave , kind , courteous , thrifty , clean and everything else a hero should be . having been chosen to secure a mystic child who holds the key to protecting the world from complete evil ( embodied perfectly by dance ) , eddie goes from california , to nepal and back , all while the beautiful kee nang ( lewis ) wonders if he 's all he says he is and a crazy old holy man ( wong , perfect as always ) knows that he is . it 's exciting , breathtaking in spots , shocking and , of course , funny . eddie is the only action hero i know who could begin a movie by making rude remarks behind some guy reading a porno magazine and end it with smart-aleck remarks about ed mcmahon . no problem with this `` child '' : it 's a `` golden '' find . nine stars . viva nepal !
`` the muppets take manhattan '' is different in a lot of ways to every other muppet movie made so far . for one , it remains the only muppet film not owned by disney . as of 2008 , the film still belongs to 20th century fox ( cbs fox at the time of its release ) even though disney owns the rights to the muppets . also , this film has a story line that 's very non-linear , and events that are otherwise unpredictable . of course , it 's very hard to beat the original `` muppet movie '' from 1979 , especially since that movie had more memorable songs than `` manhattan '' does . however , one way in which `` the muppets take manhattan '' is better than `` the muppet movie '' is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios . in the first movie , all the muppets really have to do is go to hollywood , walk into an agent 's office , and they are immediately given a `` rich & famous '' contract . in this movie , the muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success , and it 's a lot harder to do that , especially in the entertainment business , than they initially thought . that 's an important and often times overlooked message , provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the muppets , being small and made of cloth , do n't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively . above all , their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story . another note : the celebrity cameos in the movie were cool , and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the muppets . that ability right there is a testament to henson , and how appealing the muppet characters were even to adults . where `` manhattan '' falls flat , and this is where i 'm sure people will disagree with me , is with some of the key songs , especially in the end . i thought the wedding song `` he 'll make me happy '' was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding . it sounded more like a song that 's played at a funeral . every time i watch this movie , hearing that song makes me unusually depressed , especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as `` together again '' and ends happily for that matter . `` saying goodbye '' was a sad number too , but it fit better into the movie because the muppets were disbanding and were n't sure they were going to see each other again . that last song was such a let down , and perhaps even added to younger viewers ' misery of seeing their favorite muppets leave the big screen . `` the muppets take manhattan '' is overall a good film , and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other muppet films , including the newer ones made after the deaths of jim henson and richard hunt . fortunately , the film marches in the same direction as well . i just wished the film ended on a better song that was n't quite so melancholy . plus , disney should have gotten its hands on this film 's copyright and given it a proper dvd release . maybe it will someday . we 'll see .
reign over me ( 2007 ) * * * adam sandler , don cheadle , jada pinkett-smith , liv tyler , saffron burrows , donald sutherland , robert klein , melinda dillon , mike binder , jonathan banks , rae allen , paula newsome . at times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 ( sandler in his best role since `` punch-drunk love '' ) who winds up re-united with his old college roommate and friend ( cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date ) , a well-to-do dentist who seems to have it all  family , wealth , happiness  but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend 's own personal life offerings . written and directed by binder ( who co-stars as sandler 's former-best friend and acting accountant ) with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie-of-the-week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand .
i loved this movie . i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series . i found it very heart warming to see adam west , burt ward , frank gorshin , and julie newmar all back together once again . anyone who loved the batman series from the 60 's should have enjoyed return to the batcave . you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film , especially adam west . and i 'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so . i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it ... now they wished they had . i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs . now this movie will join my collection . thank you for the reunion adam and burt .
this was one of the best war movies i 've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war . all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable . the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing . this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters .
this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast . all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays . sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey . it 's kind of strange to see him in a thriller , while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey . this movie is togan gokbakar 's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director . but they all did a good job . we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast . they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry . doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar , is also a talented actress , who is known for her recent play in `` number 27 '' theatrical play and several tv series .
this is one the few movies i can watch over and over . if you 've never seen it , give it a shot . richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly , it reminds me of julia 's untimely demise . it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear .
when i first saw this show , i thought it looked interesting . i watched it , saw how it revolved around sarah , like the character sees the world ... revolving around her . i got it , but was n't laughing very much . onstage and in her show , she 's racist , crude , insensitive and hugely self-centered . i did n't get her at first , and took it all at face value . then i got to see her movie , jesus is magic . i think that served as a sarah silverman primer for me , explaining to me just what 'language ' she 's speaking . she 's like marilyn manson , working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images , but you eventually realise it is n't an assault , it 's a statement . and once you understand that , you find you 're glad someone 's finally giving it to you straight . i do n't mean to suggest only smart people will understand , or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy . while i like a lot of 'smart ' shows , i still to this day do not see the humor of curb your enthusiasm . i get the impression that it 's good , but i just do n't get it . many people will never get the sarah silverman program , but i 'm glad i eventually came around . the creators of this show do work hard , every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot , but with songs , or dream sequences , production numbers . these people are n't putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers , they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together . if i was to predict the future of this show , i 'd say it will go the way of arrested development and freaks & geeks . it will get canceled before it 's time and live on in fans ' hearts and on dvd . but take heart , ssp creators , your audience is out there , and we 'll be watching for as long as they let you make the show .
kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents ' sex lives . and grown-up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido . lastly , many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy , frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age . `` the mother '' is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is n't ready to stay home , watch `` the telly , '' and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades , and a controlling , dominating chap at that , packs it in with a massive heart attack . may ( anne reid ) and her husband have two children , each dysfunctional in his or her own way . the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture . paula ( cathryn bradshaw ) , is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer . she 's attractive , not pretty , and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first . back at her house after burying her husband , may determines to not stay there . rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure , she goes to stay with paula who has a young son . paula 's boyfriend , darren ( daniel craig ) , is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may 's son 's house . may is quite taken with hard-drinking , coke-sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was , for sure , a fellow of the royal academy of cads . what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive ( dare i say reborn ? ) widow . the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may 's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama ( or debacle , take your pick ) . the theater in manhattan was packed for today 's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may 's age . that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement . this blindingly honest look at an older woman 's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband 's desire that she stay at home and raise kids ( she also mentions he did n't like her to have friends-what a guy ) surfaces a number of issues . while may 's dalliance with darren does n't constitute incest , there are real psychological dimensions , and issues , with a mother bedding her daughter 's lover . and paula is n't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with . the affair , once disclosed , allows the peeling open of the mother-daughter relationship which , from paula 's viewpoint , left something to be desired . ms. bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother 's support as well as her love-she has n't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it is n't a bed of roses either . may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect , indeed demand , a future of happiness . but she is also inescapably vulnerable . she 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters . who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand , much less resolve . in her sixties , she 's still a work in progress . `` something 's got ta give '' recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . after all it 's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . and to insure that no serious psycho-social issues were explored , keaton 's young girlfriend , amanda peet , daughter of keaton , not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old ( er ) would-be lover never hopped into the sack . no easy out here . anne reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others ( the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views ) . kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy . 9/10 .
brazilian films often get more positive appraisals than they actually deserve . rather incredibly , contra todos ( against everybody ) ( original title , which the producers discarded : god against everybody ) got very low gpa ( grade point average ) in this website . it seems to be bluntly rejected by female spectators at large . actually , it is not so brutal . i mean as far as graphical violence is concerned . its brutality is intrinsic as it portrays would-be lumpens , i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high-tech equipment , who coldly perform murder orders in exchange of `` grana graúda '' . is this post-modern man ? is his/her only worry a quick , almost impersonal , ultra permissive lay , amidst over satiating meals ? the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 , so far . its shining editing style , à la godard , its curious soundtrack counterpoints , its more than efficient overall cast and , above all , its original narration , with subtle non-chronological hidden points that only come to light in the epilogue , deserve at least an 8 mark .
okay , i 'll admit it -- i am a goof-ball and i occasionally love a really silly comedy . while i have seen more films by kurosawa , bergman and truffaut than practically anyone on the planet , i still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that does n't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny . a few such films that immediately come to mind are monty python and the holy grail , uhf , start the revolution without me , strange brew and the bill and ted movies . they all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them . while bill & ted 's bogus journey is n't as wonderful as the original bill and ted film , it still is great fun . also , unlike the original , it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing . i remember not loving the film the first time i saw it -- possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs . but , every time i see it again i am amazed at all the great moments -- particularly those involving the grim reaper . and , by the way , this reaper is about as different from bergman 's in the seventh seal as you can get ! ! in addition to a lot of laughs , this film features some excellent music -- one way that it 's actually better than the first film . the kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes -- provided you are n't an old killjoy like de nomolos . great viewing for kids and adults alike .
these slasher pics are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . the valentine cards themselves are witty , and well thought out . the film has one peach of a line ... `` he 's no angel .... '' when he in fact is angel ! ! ! watching buffy reruns will never be the same ! the cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story does not give them enough real depth . denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . sorry but no ! the direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imaginations implied threat . much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes ... : - ( essentially , the main directorial plus , lies within the `` borrowing '' of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . psycho 's shower scene is tributed , along with halloween 's `` masking '' . murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know ! ! ! light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moments . if it was a choice between the hole and this though , choose the hole . slasher movies have had their day , and this is just another slasher . a very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking ! ! !
hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour-de-star-wars-force ( luke : how strong ? vader : the strength of a small pony ) , in which , being the master he is , he does n't even break a sweat , ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage .. -and that 's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history , its birthplace , europe , and more . from heimlich 's middle-of-the-night , `` i 've invented a maneuver ! '' to the british empire 's `` .. do you have a flag .. ? '' and ancient deadbeat gods , `` jeff ! the god of biscuits ! '' and many more , this is fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jumpstart-your-lungs funny . and i confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years , seeing as a british transvestite standup , vogueing on a chair , is one longshot of a rental after all , especially one going back 10 years now . and yet , the material is not only timeless but almost oracular , turning present day into nothing more than an amplified , funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago , although come to think about it , that may just be a coincidence .
why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary `` earth '' ? how much time do you have on earth so i can explain this to you ? ok , i will not elongate my review exploration on `` earth '' to infinity , but i must stand my ground on why this is a `` must see '' . the documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families : a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path , a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey , and an elephant mama with her small ( maybe not so small , they are elephants ) offspring migrating in africa . directors alastair forthegill & mark linfield did an `` out of this earth '' job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists . the cinematographically skilled team of richard brooks burton , mike holding , adam ravetch , and andrew shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors ; not to mention , the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e. `` earth '' is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals ; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence . so fellow earthlings , it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit `` earth '' today ! * * * * good
it 's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school . if you liked this movie , then i would suggest you watch valentine . i just found out today that the guy who played marty ( simon ) killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job . i wonder if it 's because of the part he played in the movie . it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it . when he was changing in the showers , carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready , camera , electric shock , pole . when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked . he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it , grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling . they picked him up , dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed , and they electricuted him ( slightly ) . when the kids are in detention , given by the coach , 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up . skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him . while marty is puking in the bathroom skip sneaks into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was . the lab blows up disfiguring him badly . 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded . one by one the people get killed off . i do n't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned . she could have gotten back up after marty left . she almost got out the first time .
rko studios decided to borrow both william powell from mgm and jean arthur from columbia , for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of the thin man . they succeeded to some degree . a lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than nick charles , bill powell also played in a few philo vance films in the title role . so by this time he was pretty well set in the role . doctor bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as nick charles , but the basic blasé nick is still there . one difference is that while nick charles married an heiress , doctor bradford works for a living as a physician . that helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film . he 's got two murders to solve . a jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason . the trainer suspects something afoot , but he 's bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet . this is after he comes to bill powell for help . myrna loy was a more steadying influence on bill powell than jean arthur was . arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than loy did . but it works here and she and powell have good chemistry . the ever dependable james gleason is the police inspector in the sam levene/nat pendleton role . all they needed here was asta and possibly eric blore as powell 's butler was essaying that part . if powell and arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of bradford films .
when people ask me why do i like movies so much , i usually respond , `` have you seen the art-gallery sequence in de palma 's dressed to kill ? '' that scene alone , pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film . if i was a film director , that would be the kind of thing i 'd like to do . `` pure cinema '' is one way of describing that sequence , and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma 's entire movie works at the same high artistic frequency of that scene . it is a dream-like movie , clever as hell , and with more zest and intelligence than a dozen films put together . i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion : could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success ? the film has no message to speak of , acting is great but it is at the service of the style , and the script is short on logic . de palma 's movie makes a really good case that style , when handled properly , can sustain a feature length film . sure , michael caine , angie dickinson , nancy allen and keith gordon give superlative performances , but this is a director 's movie all the way to the fadeout . it is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium . i wo n't tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to ( i do n't want to spoil any surprises ) , but i think de palma transcends the story 's arc , and he manages to create a film that pretty much summarizes his entire career . not for the faint of heart !
i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype . i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost 's image in my mind the next day , and the day after that . i 've watched it 3-4 times , and each time i appreciate it even more . the settings are gorgeous , the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects , the marsh long shots , and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss . the main hero is so likable and good natured , that he is easily sympathized with . to the person who complained that there was n't enough 'spark ' in this film , i 'd say that it 's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person . it is a fairly slow paced film , with an unusual amount of time being spent , pre and post ghost attack , on developing his character with family and work life . spoilers discussion/ i especially liked the turning point , when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost . he describes the woman in black , and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back , because after all , what harm had she done to him ? the other man says , `` you ca n't go back ... alone ! '' and lends the hero his dog . the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief , with it 's bounding through the house and even into the locked room . the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out . the woman shows up in mid shot at the church , showing that it is not afraid of the church , and is also not shy or bound to the house . this is all in the very beginning . another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence , watching the funeral . as the camera pans to the right , the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones . the older man wo n't even look at it , but the kids are all yelling and taunting it . crreeepy ... usually ghosts are hidden in shadows , haunting specific locales or people . as has been mentioned , the ghost 's malevolence and wrath are frightening , and i feel it 's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified . the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house . or perhaps he was marked no matter what , by saving the gypsy girl . the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable , and really fills the role well . i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film , and it is reassuring to see others feel the same . i can see how people do n't quite see the same masterpiece , especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype . i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man . whew .. i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling , aaww yeah . any other films to recommend ? thanks ,
deliverance is john boorman 's 1972 horror/thriller movie about a group of four atlanta businessmen ( burt reynolds , jon voight , ned beatty and ronnie cox ) , that undertake a canoe trip down the cahulawassee river before the river is dammed . along the way , a raft ( no pun intended ) of unpleasant things happen to the men . despite the nasty happenings in this picture , boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely . the location was really chosen well . indeed , this would still be a very nice film to watch , had the canoe trip gone smoothly . the lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible . not only is the location scenic , but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer vilmos zsigmond . it has been said that burt reynolds ' performance as the outdoorsman , lewis , is the star acting role in this film . i reckon however , that jon voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man , ed , who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive . in fact , the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman . it was voight himself . to cut costs the filming was n't insured and the actors did their own stunts . the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy . eric weissberg 's and steve mendel 's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the duelling banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance . at a couple of other points in the movie , we are treated to more , softer , banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river for all the good points of this film , i did find it a little lacking in purpose . it does n't build suspense very well and it is n't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe . the plot itself is somewhat poor and it does n't really go anywhere . nevertheless , this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation . i did like it but for fans of gore , there is n't really much of it . none really , in fact . it is n't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour . think of it like rambo : first blood meets three men in a boat . look out for a very young charley boorman as ed 's son . i did like this movie , the soundtrack , cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10 .
i 've only watched the first series on dvd , but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino-like script . the series is as good as goodfellas and casino , and almost as good as the godfather ( hence not a `` 10 '' ) , and far better than any of guy ritchie 's efforts . although there 's plenty of action , some of it pretty bloody , the story is character driven . even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines ; e.g . the priest 's relationship ( or lack of ) with carmilla and the restaurateur 's wife , and christopher and his dimwit friend ( who did n't last very long ( a darwin award nominee ? ) ) apart from the plot , the script and the acting , the other reasons i liked it ; 1 . it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce . 2 . the music . 3 . it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems .
as the first of the tv specials offered on the elaborate box set , `` barbra streisand : the television specials '' , released last november , this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials . as an investment , this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is streisand at her purest and most eager to impress . that she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend . signed to a long-term contract with cbs to produce hour-long variety shows , an almost extinct format nowadays , streisand was all of 22 in this cbs special first broadcast in april 1965 . at that point of her career , her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums , a few dazzling tv appearances on variety and talk shows , and her successful broadway run in `` funny girl '' . filmed in crisp black-and-white , the program is divided into three distinct parts . with the creative transitional use of `` i 'm late '' from disney 's `` alice in wonderland '' , the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as `` make believe '' and `` i 'm five '' . opening with a comic monologue about pearl from istanbul , the second part moves on location to manhattan 's chic bergdorf goodman 's where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing depression-era songs like `` i 've got plenty of nuthin ' '' and `` the best things in life are free '' with comic irony . back to basics , the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of `` when the sun comes out '' , includes a `` funny girl '' medley , and ends with her classic , melancholic take on `` happy days are here again '' over the ending credits . also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on vhs . for those who know streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising , this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now .
i do n't think that many films ( especially comedies ) have added memorable , quotable dialog like moonstruck . i wo n't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me . it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory . how about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client ? or a nice , elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon ? or perry ( john mahoney 's ) description of a female student 's youthful promise as `` moonlight in a martini '' ( my favorite line ) . moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script , first rate direction , and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly . there are other examples ( the drama the ox-bow incident is another example , but a grimmer one ) . cher , olympia dukakis , vincent gardenia , nicholas cage , john mahoney , and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love , and how to handle it . is it a good thing to be totally in love ? cher and cage , at the end , seem to think so , but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy ( and cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too , when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme ) . is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death . dukakis believes so , and ( oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced ) aiello . chance reveals infidelity - dukakis realizes early that gardenia 's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness , and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera ( but gardenia also stumbles onto cher 's similar unfaithfulness to aiello ) . but chance also causes misunderstandings : fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair . there are lovely little moments in the film too . cher 's observation about flowers leading to receiving one . her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it 's resolution . but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher 's uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita 's charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him . it is the sweetest moment of the entire film . it is close to a flawless film . after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be . when cher is at cage 's bakery , his assistant chrissy ( nada despotovich ) mentions how she is secretly in love with cage , but has been afraid to tell him . earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher , who put her in her place quickly . yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry . at the same time , the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt 's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped . was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped , besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at a homeless man 's shelter as penance ? it is a small annoyance , but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good .
this is the funniest stand up i have ever seen and i think it is the funniest i will ever see . if you do n't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity , then this is just not your cup of tea . but i honestly do n't know anyone who has seen this that has n't liked it . it is now 17 years later and my friends and i still quote everything from goonie goo goo to the fart game , aunt bunnie to the ice cream man , ralph and ed to get out ! ! there are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly have n't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever . take any of robin williams , damon wayans , the dice , george carlin or even the greats like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it . i do n't know how or where murphy got some of his material but it works . that is what it comes down to . it is funny as hell . could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to eddie doing buckwheat and mr. rogers and such on snl ? if you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the f-word for the first time , they are in complete shock . his first time he says the f-word is when he does the skit about mr. t being a homosexual. `` hey boy , hey boy . you look mighty cute in them jeans . now come on over here , and f @ * * me up the ass ! '' the crowd erupts in gales of laughter . no one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them . but the results were just awesome . i have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way i was in this stand-up . in fact , the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing was n't until 1999 when i saw south park : bigger longer and uncut . that comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular , as did delirious . i do n't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh . it is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video. `` i took your kids fishing last week . and i put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes gus . normal kids do n't do shit like that gus . then they started movin their heads around like this and the m * * * * f * * * * * come up with fish . then they looked at each other and said goonie goo goo ! i said can you believe this f * * * * n shit ? ! '' see it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off ! 10 out of 10
anyone who does n't laugh all through this movie has been embalmed . i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes . sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert , a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise . fields , at 45 , still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children . i 'm biased , i 'm in love with her . the cast of `` soapdish '' is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection . kevin kline is flawless , as are robert downey jr. , an ingénue elizabeth shue , whoopi goldberg , teri hatcher in one of her early roles , carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on . kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer , and best of all , cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious . this movie should have won oscars for best comedy , best leading lady in a comedy , best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests , including writing , directing and supporting actors and actresses . get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years . you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out .
panic in the streets opens in high noir style , a view along a dark street followed by a camera tilt upwards to a window , behind which is playing out a sleazy card game - an opening flourish which , along with some of the location shooting , anticipates some of the atmosphere welles brought a decade later in touch of evil . one of the players throws open the window ; it 's an appropriate action , serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld . shot in high contrast black and white , panic in the streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in new orleans . scenes set in such places as the mortuary , the crowded shipping office or amidst the peeling paint of 'frank 's place ' offer a unique , and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere , impossible to recreate in the studio . with these elements , kazan 's film shows the influence of dassin 's groundbreaking naked city of two years earlier , which established the gritty , almost documentary style within the noir cycle . in fact , widmark 's previous role had been in dassin 's even finer night and the city , a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent . joe macdonald , a favourite with the director , photographed panic in the streets ' detailed environment . macdonald also worked on kazan 's pinky and viva zapata ! , and went on to shoot widmark again three years later in fuller 's masterpiece pick up on south street . as others have noticed , in a manner typical of some noir films , kazan 's work offers a contrast between the confusion , sickness and immorality of the streets with the modest , calm home life of the reeds . but whereas ( for instance ) in lang 's the big heat ( 1953 ) the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character - ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance - panic in the streets places reed 's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working 'day ' . despite all the danger , ultimately he returns back to the bosom of his family justified and satisfied . the implication being that social balance has been restored , at least for the moment by his professionalism and curative skills . that imbalance of course , has been created by crime and disease . the two are closely associated in this film . it reminds one of the tagline from the much cruder cobra ( 1986 ) - where `` crime is the disease . meet the cure , '' a neat analogy in context , if one which rings too uncomfortably of social reductionism . at its climax , as blackie attempts to flee aboard ship , the visuals specifically allude to rats as being similar to criminals , both posing a menace to society 's health . as ( the presumably infected ) blackie prowls round the cheap rooms and the docks with his cronies , in search of something he suspects everyone is after , if without knowing exactly what it is , 'plague ' and 'blackie ' resonate together in the audiences mind , adding further to connected associations . ironically blackie 's hunch about poldi 's unfortunate cousin , that `` he brought something in '' of note is correct - even if , finally , its nothing he can sell or steal . blackie 's logical assumption that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it , and his so confusion is understandable . dr reed , although home-loving , and on the side of society , is a true noir hero . familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone , forced to travel beyond the limits of the law . in his way , reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large - a dimension of the film that is particularly apposite , given director kazan 's controversial personal history . the director testified before the infamous huac , naming suspected communists and fellow travellers . his film depicts suspects being hauled in for questioning , and the manhandling of the press , on the grounds that the overriding public good justified the means . these actions perhaps echo the director 's sentiments at the time , presumably accepting the mccarthyite witch hunt and the suppression of civil rights it entailed in the light of presumed communist infiltration of the entertainment industry . in these times of terrorist threats and state response , such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern . standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where blackie interrogates the dying poldi as to the precise nature of his cousin 's presumed contraband . cat like , blackie stalks his victim across the room , eventually preying over the doomed man 's sick bed , holding poldi 's feverish head in his hands - a striking , evil cradling . it 's a gesture emphasising the intimate nature of corruption , whether moral or physical . apparently , the actors did many or all of their own stunts , which leads to some other , very dramatic scenes at the end , as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the wharfs . half crawling , half scrambling over the slippery timbers at the edge of the dock pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for palance , but it is sequence that adds immensely to the immediacy of it all . occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer . apparently dr reed is left to fight a potential national emergency little government backup . perhaps just as astonishingly , he never inoculates himself - inviting a dramatic turn which never materialises . at the end of the film , too , the potential epidemic has been halted , all contactees located , a little too neatly . but these weaknesses are more than outweighed by the other satisfactions of a film that still makes for compulsive and relevant viewing today .
if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art . the actors and the direction of this film are both good . the only trouble with the film , as i can see it , is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond hollywood 's capabilities at the time this film was shot . given both the irreverence of today 's movies , as well as the willingness and abilityof today 's audiences to delve into the bizarre , i think `` even cowgirls ... would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released .
gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again . michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville . what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another . the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together . look for great performances from keaton , gedde watanabe , george wendt , mimi rogers , john turturro , soh yamamura and sab shimomo . all are perfectly cast . do n't be fooled by the low number rating . this is a 7.5 in my book . it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon . yes , there is a real hadleyville but in oregon .
i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a friend 's recommendation . i can honestly say that i can not remember another intimate dramatic film , which does so many things so well . the writing is crisp , realistic , nuanced , and even restrained . the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired , enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images , capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways . the acting is also wonderful , with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer . they reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected , raw vulnerability . a real triumph for roger michell and hanif kureishi , and the rest of the team . a must see for serious film lovers .
being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face . fortunately i do n't live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people ( or people close to that region ) . and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention : to let your head sink into your hands and say `` oh my god , how can that be possible ! '' . no , not with me , the ( in my opinion ) totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary , i watch porn , sure , but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right context . this movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons . a girl who is treated like a whore by her super-jealous boyfriend ( and still keeps coming back ) , a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel `` lover '' on the line , an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle ( she is the `` official replacement '' of his ex wife ) , a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super-annoying . after having seen it you feel almost nothing . you 're not even shocked , sad , depressed or feel like doing anything ... maybe that 's why i gave it 7 points , it made me react in a way i never reacted before . if that 's good or bad is up to you !
i spotted in the guide to films list for the santa barbara film festival , where i went when i was in hollywood , that this film was in screening . basically there is an election for the new chairman of the hong kong triads wo sing society coming up , so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this . the struggle is between `` candidates '' lam lok ( simon yam ) and big d ( tony leung ka fai ) for control of the oldest and most powerful triad parts of the society . also starring louis koo as jimmy lee , nick cheung as jet , cheung siu fai as mr . so , lam suet as big head and lam ka tung as kun . there are some good realistic corruption themes and moments , just about enough action , apart from maybe when the cops get involved , but a sequel followed , so it 's a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller . very good !
this little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo . it veers away from some of the cliché 's of the genre and adopts a looser approach . it 's about a woman searching for her missing lover ; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason . her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals . in true giallo style , murder is never far away . the cast is really rather good . we have aldofo celi ( thunderball ) , alida valli ( suspiria ) , horst frank ( cat o ' nine tails ) and a very young sybil danning ( 80 's scream queen ) . the lead actress is rosemary dexter , and while i am not familiar with her , she does a good job in leading the picture . one of the defining features of eye in the labyrinth is its music . atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack . this score , composed by roberto nicolosi , is reminiscent of miles davis , especially his work on in a silent way . it 's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli . the fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny , sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of . this is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces . well , this film falls a little short in this regard . it 's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between . the opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence . but this really is n't a particularly violent film . still , i do n't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre . the mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters ( the idiot boy saro and that unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent ? ) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy ; while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout . eye in the labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an agatha christie mystery , as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa , all under suspicion of murder ; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the ( highly unsympathetic ) murder victim . while this is n't a grade-a example of the genre , it 's certainly an appealingly different one , as it does n't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre . for giallo enthusiasts i give this a thumbs up and hope one day it 's given a nice dvd transfer . it certainly deserves the treatment .
cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester stallone 's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . it 's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars . it has great action sequence 's , edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .
first of all , i have to start this comment by saying i 'm a huge nightmare on elm street fan . i think it 's the greatest horror series ever . for me , freddy is the boogeyman ! of course , freddy 's dead , which tried to be the last chapter back then , is a weird movie . it does n't have the same atmosphere than the previous films . freddy has a lot of screen time . some think it makes him less scary , which i do agree . and that 's , in my opinion , exactly the point . this movie exists so we can know freddy a little better , who he is , who he were , how he became the man haunting our dreams . for some people , it 's a bad thing , it 's better if we never know because it 's scarier not to know why evil is evil . obviously those people wo n't like rob zombie 's remake of halloween . to truly enjoy this one , you have to see things differently . it 's not about a strange guy hiding in the bush of your dreamland waiting to scare the hell out of you . this was the first one , and it was awesome . as the years passed by , freddy killed more and more people , and nobody could ever get rid of him for good . now it 's time to learn about the nature of this evil , the psychological aspects of freddy 's realm of terror . beside the story of freddy 's past , i also really liked the atmosphere of the movie . no more kids in springwood , only crazy grown-ups . the nightmare scenes are all great . the soundtrack is awesome , especially the opening song called `` i 'm awake now '' performed by goo goo dolls . in my opinion , the final nightmare is a horror masterpiece and i ca n't believe it 's so underrated . maybe it is misunderstood , or i have different tastes ! anyway , all freddy fans should watch it . it has a lot of scary moments as well as funny moments too , and a lot of cameos ! get yourself ready for something different and you might not be disappointed .
time for a hit ! waqt dir- vipul amrutlal shah cast- amitabh bachchan , akshay kumar , priyanka chopra , shefali shah , rajpal yadav and boman irani . written by- aatish kapadia rating- * * * eureka ! we 've got it ! yes , ladies and gentlemen in vipul shah 's 'waqt ' , we have probably found this year 's first bona fide hit . replete with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial bollywood fare , 'waqt ' has all that it takes for a movie to click with the indian audiences . it 's the kinda film that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate his next phoren visit ! in this 'saga of indian emotions ' then , we have a happy family ( is n't it always ? ) of three . ishwar ( amitabh bachchan ) , the postman-turned-millionaire ( do n't ask how ! ... there 's something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that seriously- who gives a damn ! ) , married to sumi ( shefali shah ) is a doting father to aditya ( akshay kumar ) . ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son 's careless attitude towards the responsibilities of life . his love for aditya though , results in his procrastination of the grave issue . however , when faced with a situation that will test his race against time , ishwar has no alternative but to throw aditya out of the house- hoping that the new predicament might make him more conscientious of his own life . but this presumed solution becomes a problem in itself , as the rift between the loving father-son increases and the fences continue to grow . you do n't have to be a rocket-scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike . so , pre-interval you have the initially funny , later annoying comedy track of boman irani and rajpal yadav ; and post-interval there are the go for your kerchief moments between aby and akki ! writer aatish kapadia ( he also penned the original gujarati play 'aavjo vhala fari malishu ' on which the film is based ) does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid . the dialogues tend to get inconsistent at times . it does n't help that songs appear like acne on a teenage face and mar the proceedings . clearly , a couple of numbers could 've been done away with . on the directing front , vipul shows that he possesses a natural flair for story-telling . 'waqt ' , as well as his earlier debut effort 'aankhen ' , manage to keep you interested till the last reel . on a personal note- the seesaw of emotions was a tad jerky for me . but gauging from the audience reactions , it was working to the hilt . finally , 'waqt ' is all about its performances which amount to one whole point in the overall rating ! amitabh bachchan is dependable as always . his energy is visible and so is his age ! shefali pitches in a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar at every step . boman and rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics . priyanka has little to do than fulfill the perfunctory role of a heroine . when it all boils down though , 'waqt ' is akshay 's vehicle . i have always maintained that akki is as good as the role suits him . put him in a 'mujhse shaadi karogi ' and he 's fantastic , but in a 'bewafaa ' he is woefully bad . here , akki is probably at his best . whether it is his comic timing or his emotional renderings , he is near-perfect . there 's also an action scene for his fans ! ironically , his previous best endeavour was in 'aankhen'- with the same director and big b at his side ! 'waqt ' is by no means a memorable movie . it 's not one that will feature in the better films of our industry . but it is one for the masses . and at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for a universal hit , 'waqt ' might just do the trick ! - abhishek bandekar trivia- this is akshay kumar 's second consecutive film after 'bewafaa ' , in which he performs on stage during the climax ! rating- * * * * poor * * average * * * good * * * * very good * * * * * excellent 22nd april , 2005
52-pick up never got the respect it should have . it works on many levels , and has a complicated but followable plot . the actors involved give some of their finest performances . ann-margret , roy scheider , and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals . notable too are vanity , who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows , and kelly preston , who 's character will haunt you for a few days . anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this .
steven spielberg produced , wrote , came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories , so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right ? unfortunately wrong . some episodes are just fantastic , but all too often it was a mixed bag . in fact , that might have been it 's downfall is it was way too mixed . some episodes were light comedies , some were dramas , some were horror , and one was even animated , which made this a similar , but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone ( which also was around ) . normally i 'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show , but they just did n't fully work here . some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network , like the episode `` ghost train '' , which was directed by spielberg himself . in that episode , it gave the message of hope , and gave us a fantasy story , but overall it was just a build up to the ending which did n't blow me away anyways . the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama , but there were far more dramatic ones , and they grow tiring to watch . acting wise , this anthology got some big stars , similar to the original twilight zone . kevin costner , kiefer sutherland , milton berle , dom deluise , harvey keitel , beau bridges , charlie sheen , forrest whitaker , tim robbins , john lithgow , rhea perlman , danny devito , patrick swayze , christopher lloyd , june lockhart , kathy baker , weird al yankovich and many other well knowns have been in episodes of the show . it 's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series . great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself , clint eastwood , burt reynolds , bob clark , joe dante , mick garris , paul bartel , joe dante , robert zemeckis , danny devito and even martin scorsese . i 'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and/or the 80s than anyone else . amazing stories was sometimes amazing , usually good , occasionally mediocre , and every once in a while a real stinker came out . but , this show has nostalgic value to me , and it 's sort of fun to sit on boring afternoons and watch some episodes . john williams ' theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone 's head who watches this , too . my rating : good show . 30 mins . per episode . tvpg
quite simply the funniest and shiniest film-comedy of all time ... it 's certainly on my personal top-ten list . this one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale . millionaire heir , arthur bach ( moore ) , is a middle-aged 'child ' who refuses to take the mature path in life and avoids all requisite responsibilities . he also refuses to leave the bottle . one day he and his personal butler , hobson ( gielgud ) , go shopping at bergdorf goodman 's and run into petty larcenist , linda ( minnelli ) . arthur and linda 's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the film . there are hilarious set pieces aplenty . in one such scene , arthur ( drunk throughout most of the story ) knocks on the wrong apartment door and receives ear shattering threats from a human 'siren ' ( `` my husband has a gun ! ! ! ! ) . performances by everyone involved should be duly noted : geraldine fitzgerald plays arthur 's loving-yet-ruthless grandmother , sir john gielgud almost steals the entire show with his acidic droll-isms ( he took home the oscar for this one ) , and christopher cross provides the main theme song ( oscar winner `` best that you can do '' ) . it 's a shame the late dudley moore passed away last month ( march 2002 ) .
the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march . a very good film indeed . hollywood 's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner . he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies . charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius . however , the movie did tend to get a little long in places . it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version . still , it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once .
in the old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath . a famous ¨town tamer¨ named clit tollinger ( robert mitchum ) comes hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers ( leo genn , claude atkins , among others ) , baronland 's hoodlums . there he meets the blacksmith ( emile meyer ) , his daughter ( karen sharpe ) , her boyfriend ( john lupton ) , the marshal ( henry hull ) and the saloon owner ( ted de corsia ) . clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following : ¨ warning , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned . check all hardware at the marshal 's office ¨ . clint finds his ex-girlfriend , a local madame ( jan sterling ) in charge of the saloon girls ( angie dickinson , barbara lawrence , among them ) . but the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by clint . at the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder tollinger with his own hands . this is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff-for-hire who had only one more killing to go . it begins as a slow-moving western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot . the tale is almost grim , a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . the highlights are the burning at saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending . phenomenal and great role for robert mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter , he 's the whole show . vivid and lively musical score by alex north ( spartacus , cleopatra ) , atmospheric cinematography in black and white by lee garmes . the motion picture is stunningly realized by richard wilson ( al capone , three in attic ) who made good western as ¨invitation to a gunfighter and ¨zane grey¨ episodes . watchable results for this offbeat western .
well now , this was certainly a surprise episode . in this anthology science fiction series , with all of this alien beings , extraordinary occurrences and many brushes with the hereafter , this episode would certainly rate as unusual . its seemingly insignificant settings apparently not imparting any morale at story 's end . or does it ? kicking off with the silent movie form , no recorded dialog , but having musical accompaniment . in this case it 's on the sound track , not utilizing the playing of organ or piano by an on sight musician . this part of the episode , along with the ending section , also made liberal use o title cards , just like `` the old time movies . '' while these titles are a bit exaggerated and overdone , they are made so intentionally and with an affection for rather than any contempt for the silent film . veteran comedy film director , norman z. mcleod , was the man in the chair for this half-hour installment . he had been the director of many of the greatest comedies of all time , featuring people like the marx brothers , w.c. fields , harold lloyd and danny kaye . he was no stranger to to tv , as he had done a lot of work on television series . it does n't appear that he and mr. keaton had ever worked together before ( as i can not find any evidence of this ) ' but judging by the outcome of the film , they succeeded in doing so with flying colors ! anyone who directed keaton was aware that buster was also a fine comedy director as well as a comedy player . he was just as comfortable behind the camera as he was in front of it . their short partnership must have been a harmonious one , with 'give and take ' about how to do things . it is apparent that many of the gags were keaton 's , resurrected from his own silent picture days . for example , the gag of putting the pair of pants on with rollo 's ( stanley adams assistance was done by keaton and roscoe `` fatty '' arbuckle in one of the arbuckle 2 reelers , the garage ( 1919 ) . that was a clear example of his craft in a nutshell . buster knew that we film our world with a camera , rendering it a two dimensional image . this one fact is at the bottom of so many of gags . it is a cardinal rule for his film making . the cast was small and once again just chock full-of veteran talent . stanley adams was rollo and served as mr. keaton 's straight man . jesse white , the old 'maytag repair man ' , ran the fix it shop that fixed the 'time hjelmet ' . gil lamb , serene veteran of rko short comedy series , was the 1890 's cop . james flavin , george e.stone , harry fleer , warren parker , and milton parsons all rounded out this largely silent cast . without spilling the beans , let 's just say that yes , there is probably a lesson to be learned here . if not the one already mentioned , `` the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence ! `` , then how about , `` be careful in what you ask for , because you just may get it ! ''
in 1996 's `` 101 dalmatians , '' cruella de vil was arrested by the london metropolitain police ( god bless them ) for attempting to steal and murder 101 puppies - dalmatians . all covered in mud and hay , she spent the next 4 years in the `` tin can . '' now , 4 years later , she , unfortunately , was released from the jail . i say , that 's about 28 years - in dog years ! ! ! ! ! so , in 2000 , disney decided to release a sequel to the successful live-action version of the classic film and it is hereby dubbed `` 102 dalmatians . '' in it , there is a 102nd dalmatian added to the family ( oddball is the name , i think ; i should know this since this was just shown on tv recently ) , and the puppy had no spots ! ! ! ! ! also , while cruella ( again played by glenn close ) has escaped again , she wanted a bigger , better coat - made once again out of the puppies ! ! ! ! ! i especially liked the theme song - i 'm sure everybody loves the `` atomic dog '' song from the 70s or so . and now , we hear a bit of it in this movie ! ! ! ! ! `` 102 dalmatians '' is such a great film that i keep on wondering - when will there be a `` 103 dalmatians ? ? ? ? ? '' lol 10 stars
while the 'special effects ' and technical attributes of this movie may in fact be laughable to some , i have never been able to erase the images this movie etched on my young and impressionable mind when i first saw it at around 8 years of age . the story of this girl 's survival and of the trials she endured have stayed with me all these years , and i have thought back on more than one occasion about how the girl made it out of situations far beyond anything i have seen . the fact that this is a true story , and the fact that i was only a child when i first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie . each time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s i would be riveted to the television , drinking in each scene with an interest i can not explain . i suppose watching this for the first time as an adult ( and with a jaded view of the world ) it may not be as enjoyable to some . i actually went out of my way to obtain a copy so i could show this movie to my son . this , like many other movies , is not for everyone . if you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories , are partial to peru/macchu picchu and/or the amazon , then i believe you might enjoy this movie as much as i have been enjoying it for the past 30 years .
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon ( current day sri lanka ) . upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd . william dieterle , who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark , and almost eerie , undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i 've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery .
samuel fuller is an interesting filmmaker , mainly because he had some very inconsistent politics in his films . while `` shock corridor '' and `` the naked kiss '' represented the hypocrisies and lunacy of america and `` the big red one '' was an effective portrait of the horrors of war , `` merrill 's marauders '' painted war as necessary hell and `` pickup on south street '' is about the dangers of communist spies . all of his films make for very entertaining viewing , and even though he was often pigeonholed as a b-filmmaker , fuller was just as good as any of the major studio contractors . `` pickup on south street '' is no exception , and despite the dated themes , the film-making style is remarkably ahead of its time . its also a very quickly-pace , tight , and occasionally brutal film noir . the acting across the board is fantastic . richard widmark makes for a great anti-hero and jean peters is quite sexy as a girl who works for her communist spy boyfriend . the show stealer is thlema ritter however , in an absolutely delightful performance as a police stoolie . the angles fuller employs are great , making the acting sequences all the more exciting and brutal ( this is very violent for its time ) . the camera continuously moves around just as tarantino and his school would do forty years later . `` pickup on south street '' is a great action-paced noir thriller . `` shock corridor '' remains my favorite fuller film , but this is a very close second . ( 8/10 )
i was always a big fan of this movie , first of all have you seen the cast , the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well . cybill shepherd was given great reviews for her role , and they were well deserved . the beginning of this movie starts in the past when corinne jeffries ( cybill ) whose picture-perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband louie dies unexpectedly . fortunately , louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be `` recycled '' back to earth as the newborn alex finch ( robert downey , jr ) . alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while corinne tries to get on with hers . but fate crosses alexs path 23 years later when he meets corinne 's daughter miranda ( mary stuart masterson ) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories ( this is where the fun begins , and embarrassing situations occur . ) the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute . you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance , chances are you 'll like it . very funny and sweet !
this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als ( lou gehrig 's disease ) sufferer . the subject is done with compassion as well as humor . helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting . kenneth branagh , a superb actor , lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to helena 's character as part of his `` community service '' , an alternative to prison time . watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end . tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances . one comes to care deeply for the two of them .
i just saw this film , i first saw it when i was 7 and could just about remember the end . so i watched it like , 10 minutes ago , and ( i may seem like a baby as i am 12 ha-ha ) i started to cry at the ending , i forgotten how sad it was . i think i was mainly sad for anne-marie because she said : ' i love you charlie ' and also : ' i 'll miss you charlie ' , just made me really cry ha-ha . it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time , it is just a film well worth watching . watch it ha-ha , thats all i can say xd but , i love this film , its a true classic . xx maverick xx 10/10
sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies . they do n't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes , with the bad guys getting their just desserts . which is just the way i like it . great story too and ably directed by clint himself . excellent entertainment .
there are so many reasons as to why i rate the sopranos so highly , one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building . each character unfolds more and more each series . also each series has an array of different 'small time characters ' as well as the main . a good example of a character ( who was only in three episodes ) who you can feel for is david the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by robert patrick . every little detail builds the perfect tv series . the show revolves round mob boss tony soprano ( james gandolfini ) who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two . the show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable . whilst tony runs things with capos paulie ( tony sirico ) and silvio ( steve van zant ) his nephew christopher ( michael imperioli ) looks for a promotion . every episode also features tony 's other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano ( edie falco ) . on top of these problems is his uncle junior soprano ( dominic chianese ) is trying to get what he can out of tony 's businesses despite being under house arrest . all the acting is powerful and characters complex , but the two who stand out the most are ; james gandolfini who 'is ' tony soprano . also michael imperioli who plays christopher , representing the younger ( 20-30 ) generation in crime . if david chase had not created this masterpiece modern tv dramas of such caliber may not have existed , such as the wire and dexter . so the sopranos is definitely the godfather , goodfellas and pulp fiction of tv
it came by surprise . . .the impact & resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people & situations . most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger . much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way . . .a temper tantrum if you will . thinking i was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all . what was this costing me ? soooo much love . . .sooo many blessings . now i 'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels , and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life . . .for what is happening in the moment , without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way , the way i think life or people `` should '' be . this film has contributed to the freedom i now feel to connect with others , without limits & expectations . . .and to connect with genuine love . . .without fear of loss . . .just to love first , and accept what love is given .
the key to the joy and beauty , the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we do n't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth . in so doing , we find peace . elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp . in this film , the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way . this is a beautiful yet simple story , more of a fable , which is played very well . watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors . i struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it . i 'm at a loss . the story is about men in a bath house . sounds like a real turn off , right ? but , nothing could be farther from the truth . the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film , which is the bath . i 'm still at a loss . talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice . so , i 'll just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was . i was also quite entertained . i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them . for any story , that is the highest form of praise . if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less , then make sure you see the shower . netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent . i watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed english subs .
i saw jack frost for £4:00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good . for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that 's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover . the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing `` i only axed you for a smoke '' and `` worlds most pi * * ed off snow cone '' how funny and camp is that ? the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too `` jack be nimble , jack be quick , jack gouged eyes with candle sticks '' . if you 're looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror that 's full of puns then check jack frost out . 10/10
the famous international conductor daniel daréus ( michael nyqvist ) has a heart attack with his stressed busy professional life and interrupts his successful career with an early retirement . he decides to return to his hometown in the north of sweden , from where his mother left when he was a seven year-old sensitive boy bullied by conny and other school mates , to live a low-paced life . he buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local shepherd stig ( niklas falk ) , but the reluctant and shy daniel refuses in the principle . however , he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by lena ( frida hallgren ) , a local woman with a past with the local doctor . his music opens the hearts of the members of the choir , affecting their daily life : the slow tore ( andré sjöberg ) has the chance to participate in the choir ; inger ( ingela olsson ) , the wife of stig , releases her repressed sexuality ; gabriella ( helen sjöholm ) takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband ; the gossiper and frustrated siv ( ilva lööf ) opens her heart against lena ; the fat holmfrid ( mikael rahm ) cries enough against the jokes of the businessman arne ( lennart jähkel ) ; even daniel starts loving people and lena as the love of his life . when they are invited to participate in an important contest in vienna , daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true . `` så som i himmelen '' is a touching and sensitive movie , with a very beautiful story . it is impressive how director kay pollak and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in 132 minutes running time . the performances are top-notch , supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments : when gabrielle sings her song in the concert , and certainly the last concert in vienna with the audience , jury and everybody participating in the melody , and daniel making his dream come true . like in `` teorema '' , the stranger changes the lives , not of only a family , but of a conservative community . further , like many european movies , the open conclusion indicates that daniel actually died , at least in my interpretation , reaching peace with the success of his music . my eyes became wet in these two scenes . my vote is nine . title ( brazil ) : `` a vida no paraíso '' ( `` the life in the paradise '' )
this is a fine drama and a nice change of pace from today 's more hectic and loud films . it is another solid based-on-a-true store , which still means much of it could be made up for dramatic purposes . frankly , i do n't know but i liked the story . the story is about a young man back in the fifties who gets interested in rocketry and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines as everyone else , including his father , does in this west virginia town . the big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father , which i think was overdone . i would like to have a little less tension between the two . the young man , still a boy , is played by jake gyllenhaal , one of his first staring assignments , i think . he 's likable , as are his school buddies in here . it 's nice to see nice kids in a modern-day film . the two other key actors in the movie are chris cooper ( the dad ) and laura dern ( the kid 's teacher who encourages him all the time . ) the cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear . once again : i wish there more of these kind of films made today .
i thought it was an extremely clever film . i was very pleased with it and truly could n't ' ask for more . i actually own the film because i did n't return it to someone ... which i should do , but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it . also , the fact i do n't own too many foreign films and this is a first . now , i personally love finnish stuff so , that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it . but overall , its worth watching . however , if you 're not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit , then this film is not for you . 9/10 for sure .
this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art , not an entertainment business . lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating . you get absorbed into the dream and you 're let go only at the end credits . the plot necessarily comes second , but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised . just wonderful .
it is not an easy film to watch - it is over three and a half hours long and it is composed entirely of conversations . yet it is so incredibly compelling and ruthlessly observational of the human character , that it is , in my humble opinion , one of the very greatest films of all time . the film is depressing , cynical and cruel . ( if you want something uplifting , see jacques rivette 's fantastic céline and julie go boating , which was made around the same time ) . it shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing different from the society that it was trying to change . it involves a supposedly liberated ménage-à-trois between alexandre ( played by jean-pierre leaud ) , marie ( bernadette lafont ) and veronika ( francoise lebrun ) . yet alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man . the women are exposed as being willingly subservient and defining their femininity through the male gaze . the film is an extremely icy end to the highly revolutionary french new wave . this movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and had a profound effect on cinema as we know it . jean-pierre leaud was one of the key actors of the new wave , having starred ( among other films ) in the influential les quatres cent coups ( 1959 ) by francois truffaut as a rebellious teenager . director jean eustache is not as well known as other directors from the new wave , but he should be . there is no improvisation ( unlike in john cassavetes 's similar films made in the us ) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations . the film is resonant with eustache 's personal experiences . for example , francoise lebrun was a former lover of eustache . eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and the real-life person that the character marie was based on , did too . the anger and bitterness all culminate in a harrowing monologue by veronika delivered directly to the audience , breaking down the coldly objective nature of the rest of the film . this mesmerising , personal , and honest filmic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature around .
i had some reservations about this movie , i figured it would be the usual bill of fare -- - a formula movie about christmas . being in the middle of a heat wave in late june , we decided to give it a shot anyway , maybe we would see some snow . this movie turned out to be one laugh after another . ben affleck was believable in his character , but the real star of this one is james gandofini . he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great `` dad '' . if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours , definitely check this one out .
this film provides the saga of a legendary wild bill hickock . he , buffalo bill cody , and calamity jane , are the central characters . as the civil war closes , lincoln mentions his concern that the country 's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice , `` go west , young man , '' which , mercifully , the film did n't erroneously attribute to horace greeley , as a number of others did . but then , he gets assassinated , and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the american indians . in the meantime , we see wild bill hickock , who interacts with a small boy , while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the mississippi . wild bill uses a bowie knife , which he eventually gives to the boy , calling it an `` arkansas toothpick , '' which in reality was a different type of knife , though both were used throughout the frontier . hickock eventually meets buffalo bill cody , who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man . cody has just gotten married , and is bringing his bride to the old west to settle down . when they arrive at their destination , they run into calamity jane , who has a crush on hickock . she looks at cody 's wife , and asks buffalo bill , `` is this your mopsy ? '' the line was one that caused the hayes board some problem , since one definition of `` mopsy '' was prostitute . demille wanted the line in , and one of his aides pointed out that in beatrix potter 's books about peter rabbit , three of the rabbits were flopsy , mopsy , and cottontail . he pointed this out and asked the censors to identify `` the rabbit of ill virtue . '' it worked ; the line stayed in . the indians were getting restless , in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the eastern financiers . cody and hickock were asked to help scout the area , so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area . cody led the troops ; hickock went to check out the activities of an indian chief , who was an old acquaintance , and who was leading some of the hostile indians . calamity jane gets captured , and hickock gets captured trying to save her . they are brought to the chief , and although neither would talk , torture applied to hickock breaks calamity jane 's willpower , and she tells the route cody is using . the two are released , and hickock joins up with cody and his forces , in part to alert them they 're walking into a trap . with hickok 's help , they hold off the indian attack . hickock decides to go after the gun runners , and finally takes them prisoner . as they 're waiting for authorities , hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards . there are numerous historic anomalies in the film , but it retains the flavor of legend . pretty good for the 1930s .
the first mystery is to guess what welles ' original film was like . that makes this a real adventure -- to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics , imagine the beautiful woman it once supported . if you do , you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever . as mysteries go , the narrative is rather ordinary : a simple diversion , one jealous husband as red herring . what 's rather miraculous is welles ' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark , dark multifaceted world . the first real noir , but even darker . it 's not an obviously twisted world , unless you think about the camera . what we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common . for all the celebration , kane was a success because of the great drama and story . the camera 's eye was shocking , but experimental . welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self-reference of shakespeare with this eye . othello and macbeth are both begun in this period , and i consider them part of a single vision with this . the noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives , even a little -- they are manipulated by random factors in the environment . so in telling this story , welles has to make the environment into a character . several characters as suspects in the mystery . thus we have the famous lighting , blocking and angles we know ( and have since seen countless times ) . and we have the deliberately closed sets : the park , yacht , picnic area , aquarium , dock , courtroom , chinese theater and funhouse . i am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of 'external ' narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments . my own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it , among the other character-environments introduced as suspects . in other words , the manipulation of black irish ( who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist ) was neither : a force of human conspiracy ( the park or the civilized version , the courtroom ) nor of nature ( the picnic or the civilized version , the aquarium ) . instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement . this is of course a self-reference to what welles is doing : putting these people ( including himself ) through hell for our own caprice , a matter underscored by the peking opera set with welles doped up . and of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception . more about the self-reference : surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife . but i believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked , the studio environment . surely welles was as much screwed with , and in much the same way , as his character . and that screwing took the form of the murder of this film , leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment . that poor rita comes from china ties up the whole thing , the chinese theater , the expected rape from above , the loss of the woman . the investment in environment beyond all .
every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize 1 ) my life is n't as bad as i thought it was and 2 ) how important it is to adopt a child in need . there are so many out there . to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be . corrupt , but that corruption does n't have to reach your home . we all have a choice ! definitely recommend this one ... and while you 're at it , i 'd like to throw in `` the color purple '' and `` woman , thou art loosed '' by t.d . jakes . these are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life .
at least something good came out of damon runyon 's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia . `` guys and dolls , '' the seemingly indestructible stage musical , was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l. mankiewicz ( `` all about eve '' ) in a colorful , enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including vivian blaine ( from the original broadway show ) , jean simmons ( whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in `` roman holiday '' ) and two of the all-time great leading men , frank sinatra and marlon brando , both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor ( `` from here to eternity '' ) and best actor ( `` on the waterfront '' ) and were on the top of their game . one listen to brando singing `` luck be a lady tonight '' speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice . stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson , who brings down the house with `` sit down you 're rocking the boat . '' the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue 's gallery of screen gangsters . the film has a bright , cartoonish look , anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s . the characters speak in a stylized patois , apparently based on yiddish idioms . although the film 's social attitudes and gender roles are dated , it 's all great fun , and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion . just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie , but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes .
i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight . i absolutely loved it . the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night . cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain . for those of you who have seen batman begins , his character was much scarier in this film . he played his character very well . the scariest `` bad guy , '' i have seen in awhile . rachel mcadams was great . everyone in the audience laughed , gasped and cheered at the same time , as if we were on cue . the suspense is held through out the movie . the amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic . i was not disappointed in the end . i felt satisfied . the trailer does not do the movie justice . the movie is much better than the trailer indicated . do not wait for this movie to come out on video . go see it . although , i did not have to pay to see this movie , i would have gladly given 10.75 to see it . enjoy !
this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance.obviously , the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment.it 's a lot of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along.i wo n't go int to the storyline here.but i will get into the acting , which is terrific.everyone is well cast.the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters.the same filmmakers that made batman : dead end and grayson also made this short film.of the three , i probably liked this one the least , but i still thought it was well done.for me , world 's finest is a 7/10
this is a movie i had never even thought of seeing until my 3 year old spotted it at the video store and grabbed it after liking the cover picture of the animals on nabooboo island . we got it and have watched it repeatedly since ; in fact we 've rented it several times since . there are very few non-animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to ; what a nice change from dumbo and the little mermaid . the acting is outstanding , the songs are compelling , they get deep into your head and you ca n't help but singing along . the storyline , while specifically about ww2 is timeless in it 's own way and there is something new to see every time you watch . i 've heard it compared to mary poppins , but i think they are two very different movies , both excellent , but somehow my son has no interest at all in mary poppins . this is one of those movies that kids will want to watch over and over again and one that parents wo n't mind complying with . there are days we watch it before nap time and bed time and i do n't feel that groan coming that comes when he wants to repeat any other movie .
i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise 's weird movies ( magnolia , eyes wide shut ) but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie . many people said it was weird ; it was n't . it was different and confusing but not weird . weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore . different is the truman show . confusing is the matrix or the game . and unlike kubrick , this movie has a conclusion . everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately , maybe not even today , but it will make sense . vanilla sky is confusing because david aames ( tom cruise ) is confused . that 's the point . that 's where the so-called `` weirdness '' that turned critics away came in . if they had bothered to `` open [ their ] eyes '' as the original 1997 spanish movie , they would have seen that . and if that 's not enough reason to see it , go see it for the music . cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack ; he uses it to set the `` feel '' -- that notorious element that many movies lack . with songs like the beach boys ' `` good vibrations '' playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie , he creates an offbeat , yet astoundingly `` right '' feel . a wonderful film , in its script , music , acting , and images , vanilla sky is sadly , a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent . excellent : a+
two years later ... bill ( alex winter ) and ted ( keanu reeves ) are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their instruments . in the future , bill & ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man ( joss ackland ) is set to kill bill & ted by sending cyborg look-likes to destroy them . cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill & ted . now , both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future . directed by peter hewitt ( tom and huck , the borrowers ) made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects . much more funny and entertaining than the original . william sadler ( the shawshank redemption ) steals the show as the grim reaper . dvd has an good anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) transfer and an fine-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound . dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette . this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also ( believe it or not ) , one of the best sequels ever made ( depending on your point of view ) . george carlin reprises his role from the original briefly . pam grier also appears in a bit role . it 's a enjoyable fantasy comedy . ( * * * * / * * * * * ) .
in a time of magic , barbarians and demons abound a diabolical tyrant named nekhron and his mother queen juliane who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by the king jerol but when his beautiful daughter princess teegra has been kidnapped by nekhron 's goons , a warrior named larn must protect her and must defeat nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named darkwolf . a nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them ( rotoscoping ) , it 's ralph bakshi 's second best movie only with `` american pop '' being number one and `` heavy traffic '' being third and `` wizards '' being fourth . it 's certainly better than his `` cool world '' or `` lord of the rings '' , the artwork is designed by famed artist frank farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there 's also a hottie for the guys . i highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2-disc limited edition dvd from blue underground . also recommended : `` the black cauldron '' , `` the dark crystal '' , `` conan the barbarian '' , `` the wizard of oz '' , `` rock & rule '' , `` wizards '' , `` heavy metal '' , `` starchaser : legend of orin '' , `` fantastic planet '' , `` princess mononoke '' , `` nausicca : valley of the wind '' , `` conan the destroyer '' , `` willow '' , `` the princess bride '' , `` lord of the rings ( 1978 ) '' , `` the sword in the stone '' , `` excalibur '' , `` army of darkness '' , `` krull '' , `` dragonheart '' , `` king arthur '' , `` the hobbit '' , `` return of the king ( 1980 ) '' , `` conquest '' , `` american pop '' , `` jason and the argonauts '' , `` clash of the titans '' , `` the last unicorn '' , `` the secret of nimh '' , `` the flight of dragons '' , `` hercules ( disney ) '' , `` legend '' , `` the chronicles of narnia '' , `` harry potter and the goblet of fire '' .
pinjar is a genuinely good film , with great acting , good narrative , good presentation , touching emotions , etc . it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days , and this film is one evidence . no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me - i was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human . the film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar , and also some from manoj bajpai . urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition , and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face . a must-see film . a technically superior bollywood product , which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world .
actually one particular person/character is n't `` right there '' , but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie . and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves and/or big production sets , but with a great story and very ( believable ) and good actors conveying the story ( arc ) . you could call it a companion piece to great japan movies/cinema ( such as tokyo story etc . ) , not so much story-wise of course , but more mood-wise ! great acting , nuances in the performances that are truly gems . if you 're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally , than this is the one to go . as you have noticed ( as with many of my reviews ) , i 'm not getting into the story . there are places here at imdb where you can look those up , i 'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever !
for the attention of chuck davis and emefy : i saw phantom lady many years ago , when i was not yet a jazz buff . there is an exhibition going until end of june in paris 's brand new musee du quai branly , named le siecle du jazz , not to be missed , with as a special entertainment nine excerpts from jazz movies , including phantom lady 's famous drums sequence . i 've seen gene krupa - and elisha cook jr - in almost all their film appearances , and i can confirm the following : 1.elisha cook jr was dubbed in the movie . that was some progress , since in most of his other appearances he was killed ( mainly in howard hawks 's the big sleep ) . 2 . krupa probably dubbed cook in pl . i could recognize his style , since he had already graduated from the tom-tom used ( and abused ) at the beginning of his career - namely in 1937 's hollywood hotel 's sing , sing , sing sequence - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in french `` la caisse claire '' . 3 . the sequence from pl , at least as shown in the museum , is not censored.harry carasso , paris , france
the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of it 's way to make you feel comfortable , providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends . danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show ! all the leads are well acted , the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture . a crown international release .
remember these two stories fondly and in the first , set in the not too distant future , we see a young boy preparing for examination day , the state i.q test . the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test . upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why . the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth . the boy then asks , puzzled again , why would n't he ? it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry , but their son 's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial . a corker of a concluding scene ! a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present . which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present . a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion .
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in `` diva las vegas '' . i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to . she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity . her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you . the highlight of the show was her singing `` stay with me '' from her 1979 movie `` the rose '' . you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps . the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette midler 's albums .
i can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 . hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence . back then it was unrated and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay television ... especially back then . i would love to see it now as an adult where i would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it . it was probably the closest thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 . luckily i had stupid babysitters and party-going parents on the weekends . most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys . breaking into houses to sniff underwear , feeding on a stranger 's breast milk on a public bus , and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off . a very racy film for the early '70s . until i checked imdb , i had no idea this movie had such a following . most people i talk to have never heard of it .
the story is quite original , but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars . its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too , but the actual stealing should 've been more in picture ... however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you have to see ( 7/10 )
this movie is about human relationships . charming , funny , and well written , with meaningful text . it seems that morgan freeman surely have fun at the set . also good music . paz vega is a beautiful and smart woman . i really enjoy her acting . woman like her are a good motivation to learn spanish language . from the moment morgan freeman meets the cute paz vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed . 10 items or less is about zest of life . if you enjoy this film see also the pursuit of happiness with will smith and his son . thats not a action film or a nude comedy . its all about human relations .
the lead characters in this movie fall into two categories : smart and stupid . simple enough . jiri machacek ( standa ) plays a hapless , dopey guy who gets arrested for a crime he did not commit . when he tries to get financially reimbursed by his evil , former boss , the situation gets out of control . while standa is genuinely ( but endearingly ) stupid , his buddy ondrej is an absolute blithering idiot who bungles everything and manages to say and do the wrong thing every time . without ondrej , standa might stand a chance of going through life with some modest degree of success . with ondrej , life will never be boring , but it sure wo n't be without a lot of headaches ! ivan trojan plays zdenek , an evil genius type who degenerates into some hitler-esquire delusional tyrant . zdenek and his henchmen try to kill standa to keep zdenek 's secrets safe . i am very impressed with the high quality and imagination of czech films . for a relatively small country , the czech republic certainly has produced more than its share of superb entertainment . the best czech movies i have seen are : 1 ) peliky and 2 ) tmavomodrý svet ( dark blue world ) . if you see these two movies , you have seen the absolute best of czech cinema .
do n't know if this contains any spoilers or not , but i do n't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462 . i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described * guns , germs and steel * as `` politically correct '' and `` neo-marxist . '' they can not have watched the same series that * i * did . the series * i * watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies . i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky , though europeans often * were * lucky - and there 's nothing wrong with luck . neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things . if anything , the inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners , if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power . i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neo-marxist , except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations . otherwise , many african peoples * do * have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack . at the time they were at the height of their successes , the aztec , maya and inca civilisations * were * as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy ; sometimes more so . aboriginal american and khoi-san populations * were * decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans ; just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria . ( note : the khoi-san peoples are completely different from all other sub-saharan african peoples . ) so , i do n't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about . the only thing * i * can find to complain about is that the series does n't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade . there 's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film . it does , however , present some nice dramatisations of events , such as the conquest of the incas ; the production values are very high ; and it fills in a few holes here and there that did n't get covered in mrs. gruber 's sixth hour social studies class at milan middle school . if you rent or buy this , assuming you had a decent primary and/or secondary school education , you wo n't learn anything new , but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned ( or should have learned ) by the time you hit high school .
val kilmer ... love or loath him , sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go 'hey ! this guy is a great actor ! ' he did in the leather pants of jim in the doors and he 's done it again in the leather underpants of john . revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king john holmes , kilmer strutts to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years , with holmes the key suspect to a brutal manson-style slaughter . what kilmer does so effortlessly is exhude the low-life of the celebrity , the do anything to anyone craving that overwhelms anyone who had it and then lost it . go see him , you 'll know what i mean .
ever since seeing this film as a child , over 30 years ago , i never tire of watching it . from the opening scenes in the horn factory , to the car motor running from the back seat of the car , to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan , i think this was perhaps their best latter day film . after this they moved to 20th century fox , and while those films were n't terrible , they lacked the comic timing of this movie . jimmy finnlayson , their long time foil , in his last appearance with the boys , showing up as the doctor is super ! quote : `` i said goat milk `` his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost ! charlie hall and even ben turpin show up ! i 'd say all in all one of my favorite l & h comedies .
how nice to have a movie the entire family can watch together . josie bissett and rob estes ( who are married in real life ) play a couple who marry in las vegas on a whim and then not only have to break the news to their kids but then have to try to meld their respective households ( each has two boys and two girls ) into a cohesive family unit . what transpires when the group , which includes four teenagers , two preteens and two younger children , makes one wonder at first if there can ever be true happiness for carrie and jim . the fights between the kids ( and one little love affair between two of them ) make one wonder if everyone will ever be able to get along . more interesting than the brady bunch , what this is a totally enjoyable way to spend a couple hours . recommended as a feel good movie for all ages .
the marriage of maria braun ( mmb ) is about a german girl ( maria ) getting married to a german soldier ( herman braun ) just at the ending of the war . after being married for half a day and a night , herman is send to the front again . to make ends meet , maria starts working at a bar for mainly american soldiers and get to know a black soldier . she got word that herman died at the front , and things develop between her and the american soldier . herman walks in on them , in bed , and after a confrontation between him and the american , maria killed the american . herman admits to the murder , ends up in jail and maria vows to wait for him . the country is in shambles ; one sees people leaving everything that they are busy with for a cigarette . there are food shortages . it is in short , a time of survival of the fittest . basically this film projects maria 's attitudes - those attitudes she permits herself under the mentioned circumstances , as a metaphor for germany 's loss of soul after they lost the war , and how it proceeds to rebuild itself . for example , maria has the following conversation with a peddler ( played by fassbinder himself ) ; the peddler tries to sell her an excellent copy of kleist and she remarks that `` kleist burns out to quickly , it does not provide enough heat for the cold '' . the peddler answers `` that 's another way to look at it . right now , it 's probably the correct way '' . maria meets a french/german business man , karl oswald after she bargains her way into the first class train compartment . she decides to get involve with karl , `` you 're not having an affair with me ; i 'm having an affair with you '' . she also takes responsibility in the company , and after a while has the complete trust of the firm . when karl says `` i suppose we 'll just have to wait for a miracle '' she replies `` i prefer making miracles  then wait for them '' . in her own words , she has become the `` mata hari of the economic miracle '' . in a lot of fassbinder 's films he tried to expose the psychological processes which lie behind social mechanisms ( see freud ) ; in other words , he liked pointing his camera at the bullsh * t , the false social mechanisms , the pretending . the direct approach maria takes in this film is successful to convey this ideology . for example , she phones karl and when he picks up the phone her request is straight to the point `` i need someone to sleep with '' . as fassbinder said `` the emotions people felt did not exist at all and were only a kind of sentimentality which we thought we needed to be properly functioning members of society '' . he also remarked that his films are anti emotional . i particularly liked the scene when karl and maria meet in the munich restaurant ( apparently , frequently visited by hitler himself ) . maria appears in control and karl a bit on the down side , as if maria 's 'brutal honesty ' wears him out , as if he is not completely up to the situation anymore . karl says `` i have to tell myself over and over that i love life '' . maria replies `` that 's life is n't it . as if we signed a contract to enjoy life . and then we go out to eat and talk about food '' . i guess this is also about fassbinder attitudes on relationships , to never submit completely to anyone . and why would you , if the central matter of most of his films is about `` what love becomes in this society  a commodity , an instrument of power , a weapon . '' it was remarked that it is typical fassbinder to have the scenes with maria and betti walking in expensive dresses in the ruins after the war - with these clothing essentially the wrong period . what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes , when you feel bad , that `` you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great '' . but , fassbinder was not interested in perfection . any mistakes made in a film could just be corrected in the next project . since he completed films ( approximately 4 a year ) the way other people rolled cigarettes , it is not peculiar that this film has some very bad scenes . peter marthesheimer , who wrote most of the script , mentioned that fassbinder likely dreamed up the whole scene with maria and the american in the park , overnight . hanna schygulla is brilliant as maria . mostly , she just stares bluntly into the camera . in maria 's own words `` it is a bad time for emotions . but , i like it like that '' . there are different opinions about the end . after karl died of a hart attack , herman finally shows up . ( herman left for australia after he got out of prison , to `` become human again '' . ) after the testament is delivered ( made out to her and herman in half ) , maria forgets to close the gas on the stove when she lights her cigarette , and blow her and herman up . for me it is obvious that she just did that by accident . at the same time , she must have been rattled when her dreams finally seem about to come true . she must have felt as if she was not herself anymore . she felt as if she had outlived herself .
( some spoilers ) i have not read the james m. cain novel ( ` the postman always rings twice ' ) on which this movie was based , so i can not compare this film version to it , but i have seen and love the 1946 us version ( also entitled ` postman ' ) . even better is this gem from italy , which , i have read , was ` mutilated ' in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime . well , no matter  what is left is a fine piece of cinema , apparently the forerunner of the neo-realist movement in film-making . one can certainly see why  despite whatever harsh editing did go on , a pervading sense of societal and cultural , as well as personal oppression remains , hanging heavy over the protagonists , who therefore face many limits in life . consider gino , the young drifter , not well educated , unemployed , and resorting to stowing away , stealing and conning people in order to get by , his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless . in giovanna , he sees a way out , yet he should have kept going , as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money , her job ( working at the trattoria for her husband , slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen ) , and her sex . in the past , she had limited options , and decided to marry the restaurant/gas station owner ( giuseppe bregana , played by juan de landa ) anyway , knowing that he would not make her happy . she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her . on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part ( which he has in fact pocketed ) , gino wins bregana 's favor ( promising also to fix the broken water pump  water symbolizing life , or lack thereof ) and is left alone with giovanna . they immediately start a heated , passionate , yet volatile love affair . gino soon feels stifled by the relationship , and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband . wanting no part of it , gino leaves town on a train ride that he can not afford , kindly paid for him by another gypsy-type man named spagnolo , a fellow train passenger . to gino , spagnolo represents a sort of freedom , and they become friends ( spagnolo also symbolizes gino 's morality and conscience ) , traveling and finding work at a carnival together . finally gino has steady employment . to his dismay ( he is not yet over his love for giovanna ) , a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go ` back home ' to live and work with them again , as he is handy to have around . too weak-willed to resist , knowing this will reunite he and giovanna , gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple . after a while he gives in to gina 's demands to get rid of her husband . once the evil deed is done , giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever , seeming to have very little conscience , while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm . as much as he wants to leave her  he does again briefly , they are now inextricably linked , and must face the consequences . i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino 's life to act as a judge of his misdeeds  that was very good , and interesting , adding another dimension to the story . while the '46 u.s. version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters , especially the cops and the lawyers , ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone . this gives the final outcome even more potency , and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live . a minor quibble : the amount of time ( hardly any ) that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers , how quickly they kill the husband ( there is no botched first attempt as in the u.s. version ) ; gino 's very quick-to-escalate relationship with the dancer/hooker  they quickly profess their love as well , and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met !  all rather unrealistic , is n't it ? i found this time-frame problem quite distracting  it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere . otherwise , well worth the viewer 's time . the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout . recommended .
the acting in this movie was superb . as an amateur rocketeer , i found very few mistakes . as a human being , it touched my heart and soul . to watch the actors , you would think that they are the actual characters . laura dern , a favorite actress of mine , left nothing out of her performance . the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years , especially young homer . homer 's father inspired that eternal love/hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real . if you do n't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms , then get your pulse checked ( you may be dead ) .
this is the first must see film i 've seen in the last year ! it 's wickedly funny , incredibly original , unbelievably great looking ( they went for this super cool wide-screen technicolor look that 's awesome to behold , ) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society . it 's really smart satire that nails everything from homeland security to race issues , while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear . carrie anne moss turns in a comedic performance i never imagined would come from her ! she 's sweet , funny and sexy ! billy connolly is great as fido who can only grunt and moan ! and dylan baker as the dad is priceless . in fact the whole cast is perfect . henry czerny as the bad guy , tim blake nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend ( getting the idea now ? ) funny , though-provoking and just all round amazing ! go and see this movie ! it 's like nothing you 've ever seen before .
nb : spoilers within . this great movie is `` about '' so many things , all of them successfully : sci-fi time travel , unstable psychologies , dystopian society , the what-is-real syndrome , gradual undermining of belief systems , worldwide bioterrorism , and a nascent love story . the ramifications of the story 's twisted time line stir up loads of heated debate - witness the discussions within this site ; or , as an extreme , check out the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html . whew ! such temporal emphasis speaks mostly to the brilliant plot , coming from the magnificent work of writers david and janet peoples , not to mention the inspiration of chris marker 's `` la jetee . '' without a doubt , this is one of the most successful , fascinating time-travel movies ever conceived . but there are many other levels speaking here . the movie 's real genius is to focus on the nasty side effects of time-travel in the mind of james cole ( bruce willis , doing the best work of his career here ) . his journey progresses from gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to gradually unhinged victim  and back again . the other broad sweep of the story increasingly emphasizes the personal tale between james and dr. kathryn railly ( the wonderful madeleine stowe ) . i love the simultaneous shifting/opposing viewpoints of these two characters . for me it all comes to a head in the fleabag hotel room scene . by this point , james  once gripped by an unshakable determination  now slumps in utter doubt about his own reality ; while dr. railly  the cool and rational scientist  has finally become wildly convinced , after absorbing james 's proofs , of his horrific predictions . her desperation to get through to james and hang on to the mission shows how far she 's come . gilliam makes us care about these characters , especially through the crescendo of tension threading their lives . the balance held between emotional roller-coaster and mounting sci-fi puzzle/thriller is exquisite . and the denouement at the airport is heart-poundingly intense because we see it coming so clearly through james 's dreams . it is here , just after james has decided to quit the whole mess  and is fighting his insanity more than ever  that he steps back up to the plate and does what is necessary for mankind . see jose and the gun ( just before this , the references to hitchcock 's `` vertigo '' and identity switching/confusion are brilliant . ) this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people ; it not only holds up under repeated viewings , it demands them . `` twelve monkeys '' is intelligent , provocative , bizarre , funny , and suspenseful stuff . the supporting cast is excellent , especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines , crazed and spoiled , but ever the survivor . and there is david morse as dr. peters ( interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation ) and christopher plummer as dr. goines . but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam , surpassing here - just barely - his outstanding `` brazil . '' ( lots of parallels , of course , especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings : lunacy within , lunacy without . ) every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone . the soundtrack is terrific , too . this is one of the great achievements of the 90s , a true favorite of mine , and sure to hold up for a long time to come .
i seriously love this film so much , i never get sick of watching it . the only line i really ca n't stomach in this is when riff calls herself a teenage lobotomy but other than that , everything else is perfect . i 've never been a fan of pj soles and it did n't help to hear that she did n't even know who the ramones were until she filmed this movie , but i can ignore her snarly little face for the most part . most people who watch this over and over are fans of the ramones and really .. that 's the only reason i love it so much . i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza lines or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over , haha . one of the best parts of the film is seeing them sing do you want to dance , down the halls of the high school .. i love it . the special edition dvd has a good retrospective , surprisingly pj soles is n't on it . maybe she was working on another project * laugh * anyway , great film , even better if you 're a ramones fan .
as i 've noticed with a lot of imdb comments , certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness . i am not one of those people . if i watch an action film , i want to see explosions , gunfire and heroics . if i watch a comedy , i want to have tears of laughter in my eyes . you get the idea . therefore watching a horror film , i primarily want to be scared . the grudge is a very scary film , in both it 's well executed 'jump ' scenes , and it 's creepy imagery . i 've been a horror film fan for many years , and i 'm talking about the masters such as dario argento , rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days . if you want to be scared , watch this film . way scarier than the original japanese 'ring ' ( which i also think is a great film ) .
i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture , and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features . first off , the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets , limited settings , and creative scientific props . the acting ranges from very poor ( the two strippers ) , barely professional ( herb evers as the leading man ) , gothic overstatement ( leslie daniels as the assistant kurt ) to first-rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee 's lustful passions . the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk . issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be . this film is a thinking film in many ways . however , do n't be too fooled by its real intent . it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend 's head with the perfect body , thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul . one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties .
like others , i have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings , including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime -- including capote himself . as to capote , i can not forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith 's confessions , intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels . i believe truths and facts capote `` reserved '' for his `` book , '' which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment , would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule . capote himself could never write another major literary work after `` in cold blood . '' shame and guilt . in my opinion , he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book/drama . to him , both men had to die for his book to succeed . the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment . his actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion . capote 's book is not truth . it is not factual or journalistic . it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination . what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote 's mind , which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all . no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake 's performance . that actor is the nightmare from capote 's dishonest imaginings . so who is to say how the two killers should be played ? who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to `` do it now '' killing ? i agree with the few who see in eric roberts ' work a magnificent performance , shakespearean in its range , yet played with heartbreaking sincerity . anthony edwards takes a much safer `` attitude mode '' to create a smarmy hickok ; but he is one-dimensional and boring , with only a few notes in his television range . roberts is almost four-dimensional , adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body , a frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do . like leopold apropos loeb , robert 's perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man . without hickok or a man of his particularities , perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors . he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life . given the freedom from capote 's death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings , roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama . same facts , some of the same lines from the case record , but deeper , more complex , with clearly titanic psychotic stresses -- indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is . what many of our reviewers dislike about this film , roberts in particular , is that cold-blooded killing is n't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand . that is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic `` interpretation of life and death '' than capote could ever create -- a real tragedy . the actual cold-blooded killer , mr. capote , and his hypocritically artistic `` non-fiction novel '' do not control these interpretations and performances . if `` in cold blood '' and capote 's effect on life , literature and truth matters as much as scholars say , then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth , or a version of the truth , that is not the rank , cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote 's own abyss .
i need to be honest . i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross , offensive , hilarious , and raunchy . yeah , there is a lot of humor for all tastes . if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards , for example then you will have a great time for it . or , if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad , you will also have a great time . and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh , you will enjoy the show . i enjoy all three kinds of humor that `` dirty sànchez '' offers . i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show . `` jackass '' is like a walk in the park compared to this one . so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass , give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show . with all due respect . this is a show that has little taste or class . it 's not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed out . now , these guys need to see a psychologist . specially the paco character .
following directly from where the story left off in part one , the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man 's legacy is exactly as such . in direct contrast to the first feature , part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country , to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties . the change of setting is n't just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature , replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical , battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle . yet , as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle . while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that , part two takes a much more refined , callous and bleak segment of che 's life and ambition , and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible , easy to grasp manner . while the movie 's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however , there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible . this somewhat distant , cold approach to telling che 's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off ; indeed , i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything , the entirety of che , taken as a whole , delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man 's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way . by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago ( excuse the ironic contrast ) ; che is a slow moving , reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing . yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak , decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two , the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that does n't feel too disjointed from its predecessor , but does enough to give it its own reference points . here , the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere 's the initial struggle , the battles , the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them , all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement . yet , as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know , part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming , and disquieting note . this difference , in combination with the similarities to part one , make a compelling and memorable whole ; by all means , both could be digested one their own ( and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such ) and enjoyed as they are , but taken as one statement , che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve . indeed , everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building , realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible , but with a feature such as this , part two once again proves that avoiding such elements do n't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged . in fact , upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one , and title the review as a whole , yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively . with that said , i can not rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime , but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part 's ability to do just that . with a reflective , intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie 's characters without drawing attention to themselves , che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor , but this time with a tragic but uplifting , reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film . - a review by jamie robert ward ( http : //www.invocus.net )
prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and 'happy vibes ' , what with stories of fights , chaos , murder and of course extreme male bonding ! but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether . horror films set in cells are , as you probably know , nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape  two of the greatest themes in horror cinema . with such examples as the chair ( waldermar korzeniowsky , 1988 ) , the green mile ( frank darabont , 1999 ) , alien 3 ( david fincher , 1992 ) and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself , another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised . or at least that 's what you 'd have thought . prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it 's somewhat of a shame that it is n't as well known as it should be . the film , in short , centres on an old prison ( well , duh ! ) which has been reopened . however , it 's not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear , but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind ; death ! and boy , are we treated to some awesome death scenes ! i wo n't spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands . besides the special effects and the murders , this film also has another thing going for it ; it 's cast . headlining , we have lord of the rings ( peter jackson , 2001-2003 ) star viggo mortensen ( and for all those so inclined , yes , he does get naked ) whose performance is not only highly believable , but is done with such skill that his eastwood-esquire character is both bad-to-the-bone and likable ( a very delicate mix ) . add him to a cast of 'hey-wait-a-minute-i-know-that-guy ' actors and you 've got yourself one great set of stars . the characters themselves however lack three-dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical . we 've got a black oculist , a hard-as-nails prison warden , a human-rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters . but in all honesty , this 'fault ' actually aids the film . instead of boring character development in an over-long equilibrium , we are chucked , more or less , straight into the action and once it gets going ( very early on ) there 's not a single scene that 's a filler  it 's balls to the wall plot . unlike a certain shawshank redemption ( frank darabont , 1994 ) ! sharing conventions with the slasher genre , this is somewhat of a convention itself , and , in good ol ' slasher genre tradition , prison punishes those who have been bad . all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world . with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans . do n't be fooled into thinking it 'll be a cheesy little film either , just because it was made in usa 1980s , it 's far from cheesy ( although the very end does ruin this ) and , simultaneously , far from gritty and realistic ( whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape , these are rather subtly done ) . i give it 3.5 out of 5 luvs . a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed .
'iphigenia ' is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis . this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast . cacoyannis achieved the impossible . he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance . a stellar greek cast helps him in this . newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia . equally impressive is irene papas , who even though she sometimes seems over the top , it is very realistic . a wonderful greek film , beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis , with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every scene . p.s . rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote ! ! !
so terrific , so good . i have never seen a man be more funny than eddie murphy . in this stand-up-comedy you will see a lot of imitations more done by anyone ! if you have seen raw ( 1987 ) you will have to see delirious . it 's so funny ! it 's so professional !
such a masterpiece as the first of these two snowy river films was , the sequel to the man from snowy river is everything that a follow-up should be . it does not tread on the toes of its predecessor , preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality . the man from snowy river ii is based upon the return of jim craig to the snowy river country after a three year absence . the film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century , of australian history , legend and horses . the storyline demonstrates a touch of hollywood in lighter shades , an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film , yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of australian patriotism . the plot is far more vibrant than the first film , and much more showy , with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film , yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film ; sensationally beautiful cinematography , a stunning focus of the australian high country , the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed , and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland which equals the first in every way . geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film , and it is highly worthy of recognition , especially with regard to the quality of the australian film industry . the lead cast , from tom burlinson to sigrid thornton , and a well-replaced brian dennehy , carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film . as far as sequels can go , the man from snowy river ii is a masterpiece ; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again .
just saw the world preem of fido at the toronto international film festival and thoroughly enjoyed it . here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered ( certainly 'fleshed out ' extensively and successfully ) by george romero . but this is a canadian film by a canadian director and it 's a comedy ! and , yes , i actually think it is better than 'shawn of the dead ' . thoroughly believable and , perhaps even more importantly , enjoyable performances by dylan baker , carrie-anne moss and young actor k'sun ray , whom i suspect we 'll be seeing a lot more of in future features . however , i must confess that i most enjoyed the delicious turn by tim blake nelson as neighbour mr. theopolis , essentially playing a willing animated version of victor van dort from the corpse bride ( or , for those who 've seen the film , would n't that read even better here as the corpse pride ? ) and , of course , scotch actor billy connolly in his least animated , yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character . just think , he would not have gotten this role had it not been for peter stormare 's commitments to prison break ( as was revealed in the q & a following thursday night 's screening ) . i ca n't help but speculate that the screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from day of the dead 's zombie 'bub'.i am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a comment and i wo n't start now . suffice it to say that fido is not one of those dour , graphically gory zombie films you can rely on from romero . rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and , although ( and i did have to think back carefully to be sure ) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence , the delectable humour , so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by director currie and his co-screenwriters , goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated pg-13 . i urge you to go see this little canuck gem . i 'll certainly be buying the dvd once it emerges hopefully by next summer .
for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films , this movie should be a treat . the only thing i did n't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode . in general , however , this is a solid , spooky little movie . if this is not amicus ' best film , it 's certainly one of them . the best episode , rightfully saved for last , is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor -- it is really excellent . as good as pertwee was in this role , it 's hard to believe he did n't do more of these types of movies . all in all , this is an entertaining movie , which scared the heck out of me as a child , and which still gives me the creeps to this day .
this is an excellent film , and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings , as it is unavailable on video/dvd . the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving , and ends with them leaving ( although quite a lot happens in between , and they do n't stay in one place during this time ) , gives you a sense of closure , and a feeling that all is right with the world . if you get a chance to see this film , then do . i ca n't wait to see it again , and wish that it could be put on general release .
bored and unhappy young babe zandalee ( a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout erika anderson ) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent , yet dull businessman thierry martin ( a solid and credible portrayal by judge reinhold ) . zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist johnny collins ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by nicolas cage ) . can the relationship between thierry and zandalee be salvaged ? or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed ? director sam pillsbury and screenwriter mari kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences ; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third . the dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar ( sample line : `` i wan na shake you naked and eat you alive '' ) . better still , this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity ( the gorgeously statuesque anderson looks smoking hot in the buff ) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes ( johnny and zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight ) . the tart'n'tangy new orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings . with his long , scruffy black hair , greasy mustache , foul mouth , and coarse manners , cage 's johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing `` romantic '' lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid . the cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity : anderson , cage and reinhold all do respectable work with their parts , with fine support from joe pantoliano as zandalee 's merry flamboyant homosexual friend gerri , viveca lindfors as theirry 's wise , perceptive mother tatta , aaron neville as friendly bartender jack , and steve buscemi as a funny , blithely shameless thief . walt lloyd 's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look . the flavorsome , harmonic score by pray for rain likewise hits the spot . a delightfully campy and seamy riot .
i nominate this and babylon 5 as the best television sci-fi series made . both stand out in my mind because unlike early star trek series , there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters . if you look at the original star trek and star trek : tng , they were fine shows , but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes . in many ways , you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring . this was less the case with deep space 9 ( with its giant battles that took up all of the final season ) and the other trek shows , as there was more of a larger story that unified them . this coherence seems to have developed as a concept with babylon 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with sg-1 . the bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form . sure , there were a few `` throwaway '' episodes that were not connected to the rest , but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny . and speaking of funny , i loved that sg-1 kept the mood light from time to time and was n't so dreadfully serious . in this way , i actually enjoyed it more than babylon 5 . jack o'neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of homer simpson -- it 's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons . to truly appreciate sg-1 , you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work . this coherence gives the show exceptional staying power . and , if you do n't like sg-1 after giving it a fair chance , then sci-fi is probably not the genre for you .
new york i love you is full of love and power . not for everybody , however , but is a beautiful movie . it has the likes of shia labeouf ( seen in transformers , disturbia , charlies angels , i robot , indiana jones , and many more ) , maggie q , kevin bacon , blake lively , natalie portman , and many more . with a star-studded cast , this movie is without a doubt , brilliant . from many top-notch directors around the world , it does not fail to impress . the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique . it is safe to say that new york i love you is a popcorn movie , and should be watched on a big tv ! this time , trust the imdb rating , because it is an excellent film . eagerly waiting shanghai i love you in 2010 . watch ny ily , you wo n't be disappointed .
it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience . shumlin did n't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art . it is , however , a beautiful movie . i have loved it since local channels used to show it . graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century . some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories . ( many love `` the fallen idol '' but i am not among them . i think i saw `` brighton rock '' once many years ago and liked it but maybe i 'm simply thinking fondly of the novel . ) this is superbly cast . charles boyer does not , it 's true , come across as spanish . but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired , wary , caring . lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him . but the supporting players are the best : katina paxinou is excellent . her performance is a little grand guignol , but i attribute that to the director . peter lorre , whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto-like universal language , is excellent -- as always . and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart . she comes across as a precocious early teenager . the character wants to be helpful . she does her best . i recommend this movie highly . not without reservations . the reservation is , primarily , that it is a little stolid . but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered .
gone in 60 sec . where do i began , it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars . people say its not a good movie i disagree sure it has some cheesy parts but what action movie does n't . i gave it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the rock or face off than this movie is right up your alley cage dose a good job along with one of the most under rated actors in my mind del-roy lindo . i think sometimes people look to far into movies some times you need to sit back enjoy the movie and after words ask yourself did they achieve what they where showing . meaning if they where going for action was it action pact . if they where trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and trying to win every award out their well did they ? i think they made the action movie they set out to make , give it a chance and you wont be sorry .
i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend . evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such , but i can say with some relief that it 's not so infused with estrogen that it 's painful for a red-blooded male to watch . except for a single instance at the very end of the movie , i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama . ladies , for their part , will absolutely love this movie . ann lord is elderly , bed-ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side . discomfited by the memories of her past , ann suddenly calls out a man 's name her daughters have never heard before : harris . while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother 's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times , ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris - and in doing so , lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with . both ann and her two daughters - one married with children , one a serial `` commitophobe '' - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists , and perhaps more importantly , if true love can endure the test of time . are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever ? will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome ? the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters . the cinematography for evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in ann 's mind as she recalls the past , and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed , to give everyone an ethereal glow ( and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real , but occurred in the past ) . claire danes is beautiful ( appearing to be really , really tall , though just 5 ' 5 '' in reality ) , and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test . you ca n't really talk trash about the cast , which leads off with claire danes and does n't let up from there : vanessa redgrave , patrick wilson , meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film . i ca n't really say anything negative about this film at all , though hugh dancy 's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss . playing the spoiled , lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably does n't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them . in the end , gentlemen , your lady friend will most certainly weep , and while you 'll likely not feel nearly as affected , the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening . catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick . it 'll be your little secret that this viewing did n't really cost you much at all .
i recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable . it took me by surprise , even though , i should have expected it from the team involved with this movie . henry bromwell directed this film with a sure hand , and it shows . one always wonders about the secret life of hit killers . one does n't have to go too far to realize they probably are one 's own neighbors , or social acquaintances , or even friends ; they 're no different from us , at least on the surface . in this story , the grandfather , is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price . he has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son , and even to the grandson ! alex , is a man living in turmoil . he knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions . he has to see someone to help him find peace with himself . in going to dr . parks , he is trying to find absolution , although , he does n't find it there . on the contrary , there is a dramatic twist when alex learns about who is supposed to kill next . alex , brilliantly portrayed by william h. macy , mesmerizes us . not only is he a fantastic actor , but he makes us believe he is that man . one of the best things in the movie is the late john ritter . he is equally convincing as dr . parks , the man who unravels the mystery . donald sutherland , as the grandfather is perfect . he is a natural actor in everything he does . neve campbell surprised in her pivotal role of sarah . she shows a capability and range that are incredible . tracey ullman is martha , the suffering wife , and she does n't get to do much . also barbara bain , in a rare appearance , is the grandmother from hell . david dorfman , is a delight in the film . he shows a maturity beyond his years .
just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level , this is a rebirth for motion capture . neither movie nor cartoon , this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir , akira , sin city , blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists . you see paris the way it almost could be , the characters seem as real as you and i . they blink , trip , shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before . do n't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister . you will most likely figure it out before you 're half way from the movie . the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers , but this definitely is bliss for the eyes .
yesterday , i went alone to the cinema , because here in mexico , most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called `` camára alternativa '' ( alternative camera ) . but after i saw this movie , i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative . afortunately , this is a good a example . but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie .. that at the end i was happy .. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days . and the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... the love is main force behind us . this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish ... and i have to mention the good music .. specially the main song of the movie .. cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... excellent song ! ! !
this film was excellent , i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre . this one however got all the ingredients , a factory 1970 hemi challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars ! i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi , and he sure did that a lot : )
me and my girlfriend , annette , watched this together and we 'll both comment . both of us really enjoyed watching this even though it took some liberties with dicken 's work . a lot of dicken 's works are somewhat dark and dreary ( including oliver twist ) , but this movie changed all that . it was fun , colourful ( both visually and musically ) , and the characters were more lighthearted . travis : normally , i do n't care a lot for musical and dance movies , but the tunes in this production were catchy and lively , and the choreography was awesome . annette : that 's really saying a lot coming from travis . i ca n't emphasise enough how really good the dance numbers were . you can tell , for example , that those boys really worked hard getting the routines down to perfection . travis : three actors really stood out imo ; nancy ( shani w. ) , bill sykes ( oliver reed ) , and artful dodger ( jack wild ) . man , that oliver reed can really do a good villain . that one scene where you see his eyes thru the mail slot gave me chills down the back ... awesome . and that kid jack wild was a perfect artful dodger . and nancy was fantastic ( man , i felt bad when she got killed ) . she can sing too ! kudos to the casting department on their choices there . i hated the oliver twist kid tho . he was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste . ( i kept wishing bill sikes would drop him off into the mud during the chase scene . ) and they should n't have had him sing either . annette : acting was truly superb . in addition to the three stars travis mentioned , i felt ron moody ( fagin ) did a tremendous job . he was so funny , and at the same time lightly sinister too . the supporting actors were great too . harry secombe carried his mr. bumble role extremely well . and he has a wonderful singing voice . i saw mr. secombe perform in another movie entitled `` davy '' where he played an opera singer with pleasing results . the talented harry secombe should have been in a lot more movies . travis : as i mentioned earlier the story is n't quite true to the book , but imo it was more robust . this movie was not boring either , as some musicals seem to be . and the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters . the tunes did not detract from the plot or put you to sleep by being too long . annette : any musical movie which travis watches completely has to be a rare find . and this one is indeed a rare find . it is a very easy-to-watch production which carries the viewer smoothly and enjoyably through to the end . in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces , this was a refreshing interlude . our combined rating for this was 8.5 of 10 . ( we 'll round up to 9 in this case. ) . travis : i rated this a 7 mainly because the oliver twist kid ( mark l. ) irritated me , and his songs were torture to my overly sensitive ears . otherwise , it was an outstanding movie . annette : my rating is a 10 . movies do n't get much better than this . and you can tell everyone involved in this production really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece . please do n't miss this one ... even if you normally do n't like musicals . it really is a rare treat .
`` slaughter high '' is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd marty , who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters.the prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned.five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of course , and low and behold marty murders them one after another.british actress caroline munro ( `` maniac '' ) leads the cast as the heroine ( who dies anyway ! ) .the acting is completely awful , there 's also no suspense at all.plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore-freaks : a guy 's stomach explodes , another female victim literally gets an acid bath , a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted , a guy is crushed by a tractor , one girl is drowned , and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye.the killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester 's mask and the setting ( a beautiful old english castle ) is really nice.however the dream finale is utterly pathetic.all in all it 's true that `` slaughter high '' is a piece of garbage , but i enjoyed it.only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks .
ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60 's world . the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional . i got this game april 2007 ( two years after release ) , and i am still impressed with the gameplay . it 's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games . i give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains , especially the `` consulate '' level . i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over . the only thing i did n't like in the game is the russian boat level , it was too much pressure . on the whole i like the game a lot ! !
`` the matador '' is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow , happily-married american businessman ( greg kinnear ) in mexico . although the sardonic julian ( ironically surnamed `` noble '' ) appears to be a `` tough guy '' on the surface , underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities , a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless . thus on his birthday , he reaches out to danny , a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian 's `` unconventional '' lifestyle . in fact , both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter , franker moments of self-evaluation . although the film is a bit too reminiscent of `` analyze this '' and `` midnight run '' to feel entirely fresh and original , `` the matador , '' nevertheless , earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting . brosnan , looking aged and almost used up , sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before . playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being , brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment , then genuine and sympathetic the next . he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale . kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens . hope davis does a fine job as `` bean , '' danny 's loyal and loving wife who , like her husband , finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and `` dangerous '' figure from a world far different from the one she knows . at times , we find ourselves feeling that `` the matador '' is holding something back from us , not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise . at the end it feels a little too light , a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should . this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director richard shephard , and he has n't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet . still , one appreciates the fact that he does n't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece , rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . 'the matador '' is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will , hopefully , signal a new phase in brosnan 's acting career .
this is the kind of movie the us does n't make . it 's why people rent foreign films . it 's a great story about how one person , even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life . everybody can learn from georges . it also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way ( i think ) . as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending , but that only makes it a better movie .
all dogs go to heaven is the most cutest animated film to have dogs in 1989 . the previous don bluth film the land before time ( 1988 ) became a success . dogs are so cute as little mice . aw , i just want to hug them when they 're cute . where was i ? oh , yes . its animation is beautiful , the characters are great when they 're perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching . it opened in november 17 1989 the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature animation . the part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable . carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie . shame on him ! the love survive song performed by irene cara and freddie jackson was so beautiful . all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever .
this show is awesome ! i have been a fan since it premiered , and it only keeps me watching ... i 've seen some terrible things here , that i wish i had n't , but , it really shows you how addiction affects all involved , not just the addict . you can see all kinds of different addictions , from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict , or the eating disorder addict . and actually , it 's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also . we 've seen accomplished musicians , an nba player , and even young people , who really need the help . and since they have started showing a few follow-ups , that 's been awesome too . now , you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired . if you have n't checked this one out , please do . it 's on a & e , and it 's awesome ! the new eps are sunday nights at 10pm est , if i remember correctly ... so set your tivo !
yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material . but then it does n't try to be anything it is not . a fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners , a stellar and very funny performance by peter o'toole , a grounding and down to earth performance from joan plowright . the band 's performance was on the spot , each one playing their role in a deft , comical manner . the music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . from some of the negative comments i deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . a good example is the comment about the `` strange baseball-like game '' , well my dear american , that was cricket -from which baseball is derived- and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket . also no , you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window ; it was funny how lord foxley said `` oh yes ! '' to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time `` oh no '' also referring to the money . jeez , it seems that every joke must be explained to some people ... all-in-all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs ! well worth seeing .
other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well ( or better ) that i could , but i would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film . it holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay , acting , photography , set design , sound design ... it really is a classic of sorts . this was my first exposure to the `` young '' alec guinness , and it 's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood . i only rate it an `` 8 '' because it 's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but does n't really skewer it ; and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end , rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town . also , a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes ( especially dress clothes ) ; children grow up , people change sizes , gain and lose weight , and go with the latest fashions all the time , and have as long as looms have woven cloth . and if nothing else , the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms ( especially bdus ) . still , this is a great film . if you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel , you should .
i believe that the sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it . i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released . in all 42 episodes so far , the best one is definitely episode # 3 , denial , anger , acceptance . this episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in the sopranos . his name was brendan filone . he was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver . brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against tony and his gang . in the end , he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath , and that 's my most favorite scene ever in the history of the sopranos . brendan filone is # 1 for me . and my # 2 most favorite character ever was matthew bevilaqua , who was killed after attempting to murder christopher moltisanti . tony and pussy shoot him in hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him . my # 3 most favorite character is sean gismonte , who was killed right after shooting christopher . and finally , my # 4 most favorite character is chucky signore , one of uncle junior 's henchmen . he was killed on a boat by tony . all the awesome characters are dead . that 's the only bad thing about the sopranos . all the cool guys always get killed . you know what would be great to change about the sopranos ? they should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture chris , tony , uncle junior , silvio , and paulie , because they need to get their revenge . brendan filone shall strike back ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1
after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer ( 1976 ) to be the final chapter in the series . dirty harry is back , older , more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic . dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer , vigilante cops , and vietnam veteran terrorists . but now he 's after a new killer , a killer who wants payback , by gunning down her attackers . sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry . callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman ( played by sondra locke ) , who was brutally raped , along with her sister , who is left traumitized . ten years after , she 's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers . at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack , of which the mob are hunting him as well . so in order to let the heat die down within the city , harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town , but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well , while hunting her attackers one by one . harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar , as he homes in on the killer 's trails . sudden impact in my opinion , has to be one of my top 10 revenge films , as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet , far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined . sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had , a dark tone with entertaining value . so do you feel lucky , punk ?
in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual `` revolution '' ( purposefully i use quotations for that word ) , jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic , damning critique of those who ca n't seem to get enough love . if there is a message to this film- and i 'd hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben-hur length feature has to offer- it 's that in order to love , honestly , there has to be some level of happiness , of real truth . is it possible to have two lovers ? some can try , but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want , or feel they can even express to say what they want ? what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre ( jean-pierre leaud ) has with the women around him ? he 's a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual , not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman , marie ( bernadette lafont ) slightly older than him and is usually , if not always , his lover , his last possible love-of-his-life left him , and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street , veronika ( françoise lebrun ) , who perhaps reminds him of her . soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film , where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures . at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre , but we 're mistaken . the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around , talking on and on , for something to sink in . we 're told that part of the sexual revolution , in theory if not entirely in practice ( perhaps it was , i ca n't say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand ) , was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions . but eustache 's point , if not entirely message , is that it 's practically impossible to have it both ways : you ca n't have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with `` f * * * ing '' , as the characters refer over and over again . the mother and the whore 's strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity , the lack of monogamy , while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you 've ever seen in a movie . at the same time we see a character like alexandre , who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it 's about some movie he saw or something bad from his past , eustache makes it so that the film itself is n't pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that it 's about pretentiousness , what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws , what they need to use when they 're ultimately alone in the morning . if you thought films like before sunrise/sunset were talky relationship flicks , you have n't met this . but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have , sometimes trivial , or 'deep ' , or sexual , or frank , or occasionally extremely ( or in a subdued manner ) emotional , it 's never , ever uninteresting or boring . on the contrary , for those who ca n't get enough of a * good * talky film , it 's exceptional . while his style does n't call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand , eustache 's new-wave touch is with the characters , and then reverberating on them . this is realism with a spike of attitude , with things at time scathing and sarcastic , crude and without shame in expression . all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we ca n't ever perceive them as 'faking ' an emotion or going at all into melodrama . it 's almost too good in naturalistic/realism terms , but for eustache 's material there is no other way around it . luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period , and both ladies , particularly labrun as the `` whore '' veronika ( a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film 's climax of sorts in one unbroken shot ) . and , as another touch , every so often , the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought , of a character sitting by themselves , listening to a record , and in contemplation or quiet agony . this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch , who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely ( and lovingly ) in approach from the late parisian . sad to say , before i saw broken flowers , i never heard of eustache or this film , and procuring it has become quite a challenge ( not available on us dvd , and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries ) . not a minute of that time was wasted ; the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work , one of the best of french relationship dramas , maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid i 've seen from the country in general . it 's complex , it 's sweet , it 's cold , it 's absorbing , and it 's very long , perhaps too long . it 's also satisfying on the kind of level that i 'd compare to scenes from a marriage ; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film 's release .
ok so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask ? ... well see this one and maybe it will make more sense .. hitchcock never blended scenes together better .... the film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you do n't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop . you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they do n't disappoint you when they do . screenwriter/producer phil hay 's surreal tale of life , blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title ... i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future .
though derivative , `` labyrinth '' still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show . finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor . it 's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of `` truth , justice , and the american way '' on a weekly basis with very little variation . his performance , permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie , was quite believable . welling rose to the occasion marvelously . as always , michael rosenbaum , as the `` handicapped '' lex , delivered , as did kristen kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed lana . allison mack , the ever-present chloe , also scored as a slightly `` off-her-rocker '' version . the use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama .
oscar-caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar-caliber-written role . i loved the nuanced , balanced exploration of a long-time marriage - how often do we get that in films , where usually the movie ends when boy & girl get together ? this is a movie for adults , a complex view through the eyes of all parties - husband , wife , son - how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story . on top of that , it gave me about 10 major belly laughs , and i 'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing . this was one of the few truly funny movies i 've seen . great , original jokes .
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved . i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . i love all six of the stooges ( curly , shemp , moe , larry , joe , and curly joe ) ! all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! this is a good three stooges short . it funny and its cast includes christine mcintyre , symona boniface , gino corrado , fred kelsey , sam flint , chester conklin , theodore lorch , lynton brent , judy malcolm , vernon dent , john tyrrell , heinie conklin , and bess flowers . the stooges performed very well in this short ! i recommend this one !
more like psychological analysis of movies , but psycho does sound better as a header . the man in charge of the movie ( the narrator if you will ) does depict movies here in his own way . most of them are classics , but all of them are listed here at imdb and i 'd strongly advise you to see them ( especially the hitchcock movies , solyaris , conversation & and the lynch movies ) , because slavoj zizek will reference them ! or in other words , he might spoil them for you . i do n't remember if he spoiled more than those i 've listed ( i think the chaplin movies too ) , but as i wrote it 'd be best if you watch them all beforehand ! in the imdb listing there is a movie missing , that i did report to them , so it might get up there pretty soon . it 's a meg ryan movie , but it 's a only a brief snippet not big of a deal anyways . zizek views and opinions are crazy and fun to listen to , if you 're open minded to see things through another perspective ( even if that does destroy your favorite movie a bit for you ... it does n't mean it will do that , but it could ) !
it has said that the movies and baseball both thrived during the great depression . it appears that the grim realities of a nation caught up in the aftermath of this economic disaster created a need for occasional relief for the populace . a temporary escape could be found in the on going soap opera that is baseball . likewise , an occasional excursion of 2 or 3 hours into the darkened auditoriums of the cinema . the presence of a radio in just about everyone 's house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world 's events and provided many a drama and ( especially ) comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality . the literature of the time also flourished at all levels . the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it , what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures . but the comic book just did not magically appear , all fully developed with all the colorful 4 color pages , all by itself . there were mediums that were ancestral to them . obviously , the newspaper comic strip was one parent , providing the visual/narrative method of story telling . the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine . the inexpensive , prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going , though not necessarily serialized , tales . the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough 's tarzan and johnston mcculley 's zorro . the 1930 's brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow , the avenger , g8 's battle aces and the spider , master of men all found their way to the news stands , among many others . one other was doc savage , a full-blooded super hero of the written story ; the covers of the pulps had perhaps , the only `` picture '' of the hero . possessing extraordinary strength , super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect , doc was the prototype super hero . he also assembled 5 of his former army buddies into a small , free lancing team of adventurers . each of them was an expert in a given field . so we had a top rated : chemist , lawyer , construction engineer , electrical engineer , geologist-archaeologist-paleontologist , etc . the doc savage stories were very popular in the 1930 's and '40 's , and were published into the middle '50 's . then they went into a hiatus for a good 12-15 years . then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new `` container '' , the paperback book . a fresh look to the cover art was introduced , featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc , with a perpetually ripped shirt . the re-introduction proved to be highly successful , with the publication of a title a month ( and for a while more ) . soon , there was a rumor of a doc savage movie ! but when , by what producer ? well , the venerable `` man of bronze '' was back on the news stands for over 10 years before any real project got put together . it was veteran stop-action animator and producer of top special effects films , geoprge pal , who did the film along with warner brothers . when doc savage , man of bronze arrived in the movie houses , it boasted of a well casted team of actors , albeit a largely `` no name '' as far familiarity with the viewers . with former tarzan of tv , ron ely 's nearly perfect casting in the lead , up and coming beauty of a starlette , pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler ( as the villainous , captain seas ) ; no other name would have been recognized . and , just maybe that was a plus in this case . the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going . use of narration , by paul frees , and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story . from the very start , there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured `` camp '' humor as the batman tv series . some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected , unlikely outcomes . ( for example , an experiment of doc 's with a miniature rocket/missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish , a small one at that . ) the whole story unfolds like that , hitting the viewer with a little 'camp ' every so often , as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously . we are also puzzled about mr. george pal 's being the producer ( his last ) . he who had been so well known for special effects , surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci-fi action setting of the pulp character 's world . i can remember seeing it quite vividly . mrs. ryan ( deanna ) was in the hospital , just having given birth to our 2nd child , michelle ( 08/14/75 ) . our older girl , jennifer , was visiting her grandmother , so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward , it was straight over to the old marquette theatre , 63rd & kedzie , here in chicago . having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc , i was sort of let down by the final product . i could accept a little of this 'camp ' business , but would not have objected if mr.pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp/comic/serial type excitement . and yet , the cast , headed-up by mr. ely and the others , made the whole film likable , if not lovable . the sets and locations were , as far as we can see , very much like those of a '30 's serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone . and maybe that 's just what they were trying for with this doc savage , man of bronze .
when i took my seat in the cinema i was in a cool mood and did n't plan on changing it . but this movie is a dramatic powerhouse . i was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward . so what have we ? theoretically a coming of age story of a teenage turkish girl living in copenhagen , denmark . it came to my mind soon that the plot seemed pretty much completely borrowed from `` bend it like beckham '' , where we had an indian girl playing football and spoiling the wedding of her sister . here we have it transferred to a turkish girl spoiling her brother 's wedding by doing kung fu . and we have a love story and a competition of course , too . after i accepted this , this really turned out to be a gripping , emotional drama and it shows off some beautiful kung fu ( i 'm not an expert , though ) . the lead actress semra turan is not only denmark 's female champion but she also delivers an excellent performance , so that it appears to be safe to assume that we have quite some autobiographic impressions here taking into account that this is her first movie and that she has no education as an actress . rest of the supporting cast is okay , camera good , kung fu intense . sidenotes : - the male turkish audience showed respect so that they must have done something right . - the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge . - xian gao , a chinese cinematic kung fu instructor/actor ( hidden tiger , crouching dragon ) played the lead role 's master if you get the chance to see this in cinema do it , you 'll probably have a good and intense experience and i do n't know if this works on small screen as well
dick tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by chester gould . he is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains , ranging from all types of visually original characters such as flattop to the blank to big boy caprice . ( these villains became so popular in the 40 's that warner bros. created their own take on the tracy-style villains in such cartoons as daffy duck ) tracy 's comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up-to-date technology advances ( notably the wristwatch communicator ) , which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie . the music was done wonderfully by danny elfman , and the original songs by madonna were interesting , but they were not the high point for her career . it 's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments , the film feels so much like batman because of elfman 's memorable sound to his pieces . i love the tough-talking kid , pacino 's acting as big boy caprice ( and that chin ! ) , madonna 's take on villainy , and the cinematography and directing were impeccable . this film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made ( warren beatty , al pacino , william forsythe , dustin hoffman , kathy bates , mandy patinkin , catherine o'hara , dick van dyke ) . the film was directed by beatty himself , which was interesting . it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part . i had to give this film an 8/10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked ( for whatever reason ) . there have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on imdb , and i still do n't understand why . the characters were completely original and vibrant , as was the style of the sets , wardrobe , lighting , and everything in this film . go buy it today . you will not be sorry .
i originally watched 8 simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked . when they did n't show it any more \ was annoyed , but then abc 1 satred showing the 2nd series . i did n't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died , however the 2nd series was n't amazing the latest series is back to it 's old excellent standard . i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times . kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed . rory is also good , he shares my name and grampa as well.i 'll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is : 1 ) stanley kubrick 2 ) god allmighty 3 ) the rest ... this movie actually is better than the book ( and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat , considering the director ) . the flawless filming stile , the acting and ( kubrick 's all time number one skill ) the music - make it the masterpiece of horror . i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it . it blew me away ! ! ! it is far better than i ever imagined it . it starts slow ( kubrick trademark ) and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense . the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film . also the film does n't offer a lot of gore ( it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless ) a trend that i hate in recent day horror films . just watch it !
robert altman should n't make a movie like this , but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly-wound thriller in that paperback-tradition of grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable . in the gingerbread man he actually has to work with something that , unfortunately , he is n't always very successful at , or at least it 's not the first thing on his checklist as director : plot . there 's one of those big , juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways , twists and plot ensues , yada yada . and it 's surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these `` i saw that coming from back there ! '' endings , or just a such a semi-conventional thriller . but it 's a surprise that pays off because , oddly enough , altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior , or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble , of a small-town georgian environment . the film drips with atmosphere ( if not total superlative craftsmanship , sometimes it 's good and sometimes just decent for altman ) , as savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid . so the atmosphere is really potent , but so are performances from ( sometimes ) hysterical kenneth branaugh , embeth davitz as the 'woman ' who lawyer branaugh gets caught up with , and robert downey jr ( when is he * not * good ? ) as the private detective in branaugh 's employ . did i neglect robert duvall , who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on ? as said , some of the plot is a little weak , or just kind of standard ( lawyer is divorced , bitter custody battle looms , innocent and goofy kids ) , but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material , something darker than some of the other grisham works that has this standing out somehow . if it 's not entirely masterful , it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-southern-noir .
as with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up . even the grim ripper made us smile . those two alien things made me laugh , bill and ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie . this is a lot better than the first one . and yet for some reason i feel that it misses something . something big . something important . made a better house and girlfriends . no , i 'd say better villains . use clones instead of robots.i gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks . the grim ripper , do n't be scared he 's not the deathy kind , is funny . when he fell from the sky i split a gut . splat , i 'm not sure about those aliens . what where they ? scientists ? no way .
i happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold , dark november afternoon . i was outside playing all day , freezing , and when i came in around 4pm , i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket . i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that was n't all happy and silly -- and was in fact dark , and moralistic . it captured my imagination . i 'm sure it misses the text , and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist . but it still captures the spirit of the story , the choice to carry a burden for the good of others , the consequences of selfish , rash decisions , etc . the quality of animation leaves room for complaint . but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations . john hurt is great in this . if you do n't like how the character is drawn , look away , and just listen to him . his voice is extraordinary . i 've seen it again many , many times and it always brings me back to that time , as a kid , thirsty for some magical adventure . it 's for this reason i say 'lucky ' , the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings . but between john hurt , and tolkien 's fantasy , it still reached me , and still does .
in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses , despair , crime , drugs , and war , along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the `` indomitable spirit '' . if you are feeling beaten down , this movie will free your mind and set you soaring . we all know how tough life can be , sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through . that 's what this film did for me and i hope it will for you .
i had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as i did when i saw daniel day-lewis play christy brown in my left foot . in fact off the scene his role was n't even over . he played the role of christy brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back . to me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role i believe it is quite true to say he put on the most oscar worthy performance in history . he was so masterful in this tough a part that i believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him . although i can not say it is the greatest movie of all time i can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it was n't even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet i will ever seen an actor do . probably a man too for that matter .
most people know paul verhoeven as the director of many good ( and bad ) sci-fi movies in hollywood . but long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land . the story is a basic femme fatale premise , nothing new or enthralling . verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences , which instead of defining our main character and his situation , are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot . the screenplay was solid , the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story . what really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting . jereone krabbe was amazing as the `` tortured artist '' , and the supporters were very good as well . also , jan de bont 's cinematography adds at least some life to the film , helping to make verhoeven look at least capable as a director . 6.5/10 * * 1/2 / * * * *
this show is good . i like the acting , funny bits and the cuteness of it . the actors , lee pace , ann friel ... etc , they all did great in the show . the show started off great with its funny , illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly , as what people said , the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway . and now i really hate the fact that it 's going to be cancelled . why does n't abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done ? ? i really wan na know how the story 's going to be . i think it should be given a chance as there 're still so many viewers who love it .
okay , that was a pretty damn good episode . much better than the credit it receives . the camera work is splendid . best yet . i love that final shot . the atmosphere is fantastic , the costumes are great and the guest cast ( minus the helpless victims ) is strong . what i do n't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained . why does it change sex ? what 's the purpose ? and they 're aliens ? what kind ? why were they never shown again in the later mythology ? i 'm giving this episode a high three stars . one of my favorites yet , but the plot holes bother me . still ... not gon na let it ruin my entertainment .
liked stanley & iris very much . acting was very good . story had a unique and interesting arrangement . the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing . characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings . very enjoyable movie .
i watched this film a few times in the 90 's and nearly split my sides laughing each time . i love eddie murphy as an actor , but this stand up is some thing else . he is so funny . even the p.c . brigade would find this hilarious . it 's a must watch , and even better if you 've got the guys or girls in for a drink . the take off of michael jackson is so like him , if you close your eyes you believe it 's him singing . the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny . my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour . anyway , highly recommended , hope you enjoy .
serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction . known as `` chapter plays , '' they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called `` chapters '' or `` episodes . '' each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week . the serial would end with a cliffhanger , as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape . the audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again . serials were especially popular with children , and for many children in the first half of the 20th century , a typical saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial , along with animated cartoons , newsreels , and two feature films . the golden age for serials was 1936-1945 . this was one of the best of the era . zorro has been seen in many films , but reed hadley ( `` racket squad '' , the undying brain ) was excellent in the role . the action is constant , and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer . zorro triumphs , as he always does .
my watch came a little too late but am glad i watched both this and the sequel together ... which makes me compliment the makers of this flick for giving such a pure and basic treatment to the idea of romanticism ... and very marginally separating it from the idea of relationships ! as a lot has been written about the movie already , it would just be appropriate to highlight few portions of the movie which i personally loved . i think the point where jesse and celine make phony phone calls to their respective friends was a very shrewd way of telling each other what they had meant to each other through a journey not even extending 24 hrs ... the curiosity of two people who both think the other has made an infallible impact on the other has been very smartly dealt with ... on the plot front , making a romantic story work on pure conversation is not an easy job to accomplish .. i believe in romantic flicks of such flavor , the characters are not clearly designed even in the writer 's and director 's mind . what the actors bring out is what becomes of them .. right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify ... to become the character , the life the actor gives has to go beyond instructions and the story ... here both the actors do just the right job ! kudos .. ! ! ! and before sunset is another feather which makes this one even more beautiful !
i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i 've every seen . it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie . my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it . in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better . but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up . and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it . thank you
gone in 60 seconds / ( 2000 ) * * * ( out of four ) '' gone in 60 seconds '' is an energetic , slick , stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles . if you are a viewer interested in cars this production , by producer jerry bruckheimer ( `` con air , '' `` the rock '' ) , is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles . although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas , its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride . the film stars giovanni ribisi ( `` the mod squad '' ) as a young crook named kip raines , who , as the movie opens , fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) . when kip 's life is threatened because of such , his older brother , randall `` memphis '' raines ( nicolas cage ) , a retired but skillful car thief , is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother 's survival : steel fifty cars-specified by model , color , year , and make-in only four days . memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist . the crew includes sara `` sway '' wayland ( angelina jolie ) , a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing memphis through previous business , a fellow named mirror man ( t.j. cross ) , the aging and wise otto halliwell ( robert duvall ) , as well as tumbler ( scott caan ) , atley jackson ( will patton ) , toby ( william lee scott ) , and donny astricky ( chi mcbrde ) . contributing to the film 's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives , roland castlebeck ( delroy lindo ) and drycoff ( timothy olyphant ) , who suspect from previous experience that memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them . there is not much time for character development here ; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core , stylish atmosphere . to make matters even worse for the film , the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone . i am not stating i think profanity and vulgarism is necessary for thrillers to flourish ; i actually honor the director 's decision to sustain from extreme foul language in a movie that could have very effortlessly earned an r-rating . however , i do believe in a movie such as `` gone in 60 seconds , '' to strongly develop the character 's enlightenment , dialogue needs to be believable and authentic . in spite of problems , the characters are effective due to the top notch , perfectly cast performers responsible . nicolas cage 's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing . angelina jolie 's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here . delroy lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable . giovanni ribisi , scott caan , robert duvall , will patton , and christopher eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles . the film contains standard structure , with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story 's style and the character 's motives , sets up a fast-paced theme of action , but lacks depth and strong character introduction . in the second act we run into a few more problems : the story wastes time during much of this segment , never really building up for the third act . while the middle of the movie occupies much time , and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot , not a whole lot happens . the third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed . the soundtrack to `` gone in 60 seconds '' contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes . it is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults . dominic sena , whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials , has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in `` gone in 60 seconds '' which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion , thrills , and excitement but not much more .
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy . brosnan is genius ; as anyone will now testify , he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role . kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role . i do n't know if i 've laughed as hard during any movie ! what an unexpected pleasure ! my favourite line would be ' i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town ' . brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse . i was also very impressed with hope davis 's performance . it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy . if you liked the dark and hilarious 'the weather man ' , you will definitely like this . i voted 10 .
i really liked the movie . i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book . i was kid-sitting for a boy and a girl , ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie . but happily , at the end , she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out . there were some great laugh-out-loud moments and the movie was not as `` gross '' as i expected it would be ... tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross-o-meter ... the only thing i can not figure out is why they had to have the `` dilly '' line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part ... that to me was the only shocker moment ( and you could hear the adults in the audience audibly gasp at that moment in the movie ) ... i have no clue why that was put in the movie ; it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock/gasp factor ... other than that , a pretty good movie . nice to see the `` pepsi '' girl all grown up .
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes . the movie 's basic plot is well chronicled , a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity . this is unquestionably lemmon and matheau 's best film as co-stars , and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are classic . the scene where oscar lines up a double date , leaves the room briefly , and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny . for any fan of intelligent comedies , the odd couple is a `` go out of your way to see it '' film .
`` read my lips '' tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain , socially maladroit female office worker ( devos ) and her workplace trainee , a crude excon ( casel ) . as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds , each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome . good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents . in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation . ( b+ )
this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film ( along the lines of tales from the crypt ) written by robert bloch ( author of psycho ) . it 's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast . the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee ( the third doctor ) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star !
one of the funnest mario 's i 've ever played . the levels are creative , there are fluid controls , and good graphics for its time . there 's also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight . sometimes the levels get frustrating , and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still , need to get more accomplished to fight a boss , it can be annoying . another complaint is the camera angle ; though it works fairly well most of the time , it can be a pain in certain situations . if your a big time mario fan ; this ones for you . even if your not a huge fan of him , i 'd still recommend this one . its a big game , and getting what you need can take a while , but it 's very satisfying . good for playing in short bursts of time . it will almost certainly hold your interest ; it sure does hold mine !
indian summer ! it was very nostalgic for me . i found it funny , heartwarming , and absolutely loved it ! anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the `` good ole ' days '' for a brief time really needs to see this one ! it starts out as 20 years later , a group of old campers returns for a `` reunion '' . i wo n't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself . the actors were great , and it contains an all star cast . everyone in it played a terrific role . you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it . alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou . he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives . this is also a good family movie for the most part . i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat ! highly recommended !
i 'd just like to say that i 've seen this film twice now and i love it ! the acting is great and even though it is a similar plot to `` raise your voice '' i think that the plot never gets boring for people who like that kind of thing . it has some great lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything if we try . an incredible film . i am sure that this is one i will be watching for a long time to come . even though britney spears write the book it is quite a realistic plot , maybe not about the falling in love part , but the part about being different and struggling but coming out best in the end is very true to real life . the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these films always beautiful ? do you really think that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average ? i doubt it ..
this film is an absolute classic for camp . that is why it was an elvira and mst3000 classic . everyone knows the story . scientist keeps his girlfriend 's head alive in a lasagna pan in his basement while he cruises town and tries to find her a body by checking out the local chicks . finally he finds a real hourglass body with a scar-faced chick 's head on top . the severed head makes friends with the failed experiment in the closet and the conehead comes out of the closet and rips off the assistant 's remaining `` good '' arm ( his other is not right from a scientist 's earlier failure ) , and the whole place burns down . the movie scared us so much as kids that my friend would n't go into his basement for a year after seeing it . as kids we ranked the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four . only one of those scary movies was really any good ( the original `` the haunting '' . ) i had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers . its eerie effect because of the crappy production and the weird sexual angle when the scientist looks for the bodies ( complete with porno sound track ) scares the hell out of innocent children , while the ridiculous aspects make it prime material for watching talking and laughing . i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i 'd rather go to the dentist than watch `` chicago '' again . seven is the most i can give it , because its entertainment value is mere luck . the film , as cinema , is a disaster .
i first saw this version of `` a christmas carol '' when it first appeared on television . i actually anticipated seeing the film when it was advertised and it more than lived up to my expectations . i have now purchased the dvd and plan to watch it every year . with the exception of `` it 's a wonderful life '' i consider this version of `` a christmas carol '' one of the best christmas movies ever made . george c. scott is excellent and a superb cast led by roger rees surrounds him ! scott proves once again that he is one of finest actors of our time . scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself . how can someone be remembered as both patton and scrooge ? scott does so easily . the direction is marvelous with the fine sets , costumes and music that give the movie a special feeling of the time , place and era depicted . you will simply love this movie and will place it among your favorites to watch during the holiday season .
i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time . i have not done so ever since . the strange thing is , i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again , and again . eddie izzard is cultivated , is poignant , is a man of the world . he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to `` engage '' in political discussion . he is above that . i would contrast him to george carlin , who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas , and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain . funniest guy on earth
i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film , and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed . it made much of the fact that the film was `` by the director of cube '' and made it look like a horror film , when in fact it is an absurdist comedy ( imdb 's spell checker does n't seem to think that absurdist is a word , but it is ) , reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are dead . i love the way the story builds up slowly at first , then gradually escalates . i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film . that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube . i recommend it .
this is a great movie , it shows what our government will to to other countries if we do n't like their government . this is n't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america , but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this . this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda . this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti . the reason this coup against chavez did n't succeed is chavez was elected with over 90 % of the vote . this movie is n't just a political documentary , it would still be a great movie if it were a drama , it 's amazing that this is real . the other reviewer is lying when he says `` chavez seizes the airwaves '' , the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time .
the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi . karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others , even his wife . his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid . lugosi plays the consummate professional , who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone , but still seems to have no real close friends . this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well . it is hard , however to hear his accent and believe he is french . the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on `` junk science '' but , in a way , even the junk science makes it work well . since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic , they are as `` relevant '' today as they were when the movie was made . and they are also as forward reaching- and always will be . this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again . i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times . the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing . i highly recommend it .
[ no spoilers ] being a david lynch film , one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do . but it is a very straight story as the title might hint . do n't except to be caught in the usual lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after viewing i.e . lost highway . it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film . that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect . it 's innovative because it so not lynch . but maybe that is lynch . he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself . being a very avantgarde director , he might just make a film like this just to tease his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he does n't give it to them . that would be crafty . the pace of the film is slow . i would almost say lawn mower speed ... do n't expect an action orgy , but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film . look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment . look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life . and listen to badalamenti 's score and the main theme that really animates the iowa and wisconsin landscapes shown frequently . farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film , making him one of the most likeable ol ' men ever depicted on film . he does n't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts . his cheerfulness just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination . need i say that his weak health in this film was n't acted ? he was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete . that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth . all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done . one could ask for homilies that are n't that obvious and a bit naive but it does n't ruin the overall picture , being that it is a memorable motion picture . 9/10 .
i did n't expect much when i first saw the dvd cover . i mean , pierce brosnan as grey owl ? ? ah ... but then the story got underway , unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film . i was surprised and delighted at this ( basically ) true story . made me want to read more about this fascinating character , which means , the director fulfilled his purpose , and the film was a success !
citizen x tells the story of andrei chikatilo , the ripper of rostov , who killed 52 people in 8 years time , mainly women and children . it shows how the investigation was obstructed by soviet bureaucracy , how hard it was to investigate the crimes . it does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no-one untouched . in the beginning it 's perhaps a little bit slow of pace , but it really grabs you as the story unfolds . i can only say that , next to `` the silence of the lambs '' , this is by far the best movie about a serial killer i 've ever seen . it is very hard to say which actor 's performance stands out above the rest in this movie . stephen rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation . donald sutherland 's performance as his cynical superior , and the only person in the russian government willing to help him , is as outstanding as rea 's . and what to say about jeffrey dumann , playing the serial killer ? dumann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred . yes , he is a monster , but he is also a sad figure , oppressed and ridiculed by his wife , his boss , his co-workers ... he is tortured , ashamed , as well as extremely vicious . i can only recommend this movie to everybody who 's interested in a well-made docu-drama , where the actors are still more important than the special effects . it deserves at least a 9/10 , perhaps even more if you ask me .
woody allen 's second movie set in london . tha tarot card murderer is killing prostitutes in london . aspiring journalist sondra pransky ( scarlett johansson ) gets a tip that he may be lord peter lyman ( hugh jackman ) . she starts to romance him but quickly falls in love . she 's helped by stage magician sid waterman ( woody allen ) who does n't like what he sees . i like this better than the over rated `` match point '' from last year . it was shorter and moved much more quickly . the plot is old but i was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end . it 's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines ( all from allen of course ) . it 's not one of allen 's best but it 's far better than his worst . the acting is , for the most part , very good . allen is bad but he 's played this character a million times before and it 's gotten tiresome . but johansson and jackman are just great -- they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances . also allen ( surprisingly ) works on their sex appeal -- there is a sequence where they 're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies . the only real debit is that allen still seems unsure on how to shot london . he 's not as off as he was on `` match point '' though -- maybe he 'll just get better as he goes along . worth seeing . i give it an 8 .
i caught this on the dish last night . i liked the movie . i traveled to russia 3 different times ( adopting our 2 kids ) . i ca n't put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing `` bad '' turn `` good '' and `` good '' turn `` semi-bad '' . i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie . like `` i ca n't belive this is happening to me '' whether it 's good or bad it the same look ( and it works ) . great ending . 7/10 . rent it or catch it on the dish like i did .
i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it . the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent , often thrilling performance complete in every way . pure , too - no synth , no smoke-shrouded lasers and strobes , no grandiose entrance ( and an unstoned , serious , and appreciative audience , all of whom left their bottle rockets at home ) . if you 're a cream fan ( or if you 've only heard of them ) ; if you 're a blues fan ; if you 're a rock 'n ' roll fan ; you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd . you also will never lose this dvd because you 'll never lend it to anyone . ( this dvd justifies selfishness ! tell them to get their own ! ) it 's too good and too replayable ; you 'll want to keep it within easy reach .
released some months before the end of the war , `` anchors aweigh '' is one of gene kelly 's major musical triumphs of the forties under the direction of george sidney , it had the benefits of a pleasant score , andbest of allthe services of gene kelly in his first true starring role at mgm the year before , in columbia 's `` cover girl , '' he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen , a light but agreeable singing voice , and considerable charm in `` anchors aweigh , '' although he was billed under frank sinatra and kathryn grayson , he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at mgm the film 's story , a kind of dry run for `` on the town '' four years later , follows sailors kelly and sinatra on shore leave , spend their holiday in hollywood , where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer ( grayson ) and her little nephew ( dean stockwell ) . grayson , it appears , has her heart set on an audition with conductor-pianist jose iturbi she gets the audition , of course ; kelly gets grayson after some misunderstandings ; and sinatra , has forgotten to be shy , and has lost his heart to a girl from brooklyn ( pamela britton ) . the plot is conventional for the period but , regrettably , it now seems barely tolerable but there is gene kelly , who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality perhaps he grins too much , but when is permitted to dance , the film finally lifts off the ground `` i begged her , '' his early song and dance with sinatra , is amusing and slightly absurd , in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a spanish courtyard , courting maiden grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps he also does a charming mexican dance with little sharon mcmanus in the square of a mexican settlement in los angeles the highlight of the movie , however , is kelly 's famous dance with the cartoon character jerry the mouse ( of `` tom and jerry '' fame ) . delightful and innovative , it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until kelly , a sailor in the `` pomeranian navy , '' wearing a striped shirt and a beret , shows him how to dance `` look at me , i 'm dancin ' ! '' says the gleeful mouse king ...
a film i expected very little from , and only watched to pass a quiet hour - but what an hour it turned out to be . roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of 'country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good ' , it is funny throughout , the characters are endearing and the pace is just right . toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt , said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny . watch out for these two . highly recommended .
i really , really enjoyed watching this movie ! at first , seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy ... but it is simply more than this ! i personally believe that this idea ( that i 'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie ) it 's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself ( or even of its marketing strategy ) ! what i mean is : nowadays we are slaves to images ! to impressions ! i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression , the wrong expectations , and at the end i felt how superficial i could be ! to exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to 'give an autograph ' , meaning to sign for the ticket , he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity . and this is just , i believe , the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves . above this , i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this , illustrated throughout the movie by sidney 's attitude : do n't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else ... `` even saints were people in the beginning '' ... as sophie once says in the movie . the saints of the moment are the stars . we attribute them an 'aura ' of perfection , of eternal happiness , but the reality is much less than that . even the saints of any religion are images , ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life . even they were not for real ... they became 'for real ' after they died and we looked back at them . and that 's the catch : we need our saints ! we need our stars ! we strive for them as if it was n't for them we would n't have anything to strive for . and television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings . we desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves . and that 's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place : to see if we can fit the benchmark , or if the benchmark is to small for us . this time it was larger than we expected .
enjoyed the movie very much . certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more , and there is truly a lot more historically to find out ! did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization , particularly of the shooting event ? there is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at ? prince albert 's contribution to uk and the monarchy warrants a movie on it 's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here . the costumes and sets are especially good but am i alone in thinking that this production ( which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one ) wanted badly for a british court historical etiquette expert beyond the duchess of york ? i.e . did princess victoria really stuff an entire truffle/rissole ( ? ) into her mouth while speaking to the prime minister in the company of his majesty with her mouth full ? 'could never really felt that sympathetic to victoriain this movie , or indeed in her shoes at all . yet loved the casting of the principals , whose acting was convincing , so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well ? i always felt like a totally detached , uninformed outside observer , much more so than with `` mrs. brown '' or even `` the queen '' . yet to be honest i still could not take my eyes off the screen , except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time .
while movie titles contains the word 'mother ' , the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother 's love for her children . however , the mother tells a different story . the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child , or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child . here , notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother 's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her . before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond , here , he plays darren , a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother , and sleeping with her daughter as well . anne reid , who was a familiar face on tv series , takes up the challenging role of the leading character , may . the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband , toots , in a family visit to her son , bobby . while she befriends darren , a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby 's house , she was shocked to found out that her daughter , paula , was sleeping with darren . at the same time , may was coping with life after the death of toots . fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her , may starts to find her life going off track , until she spends her afternoon with darren . darren was nice and friendly to may , and may soon finds some affection on darren . instead of treating him like a friend , she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple . later , may found sexual pleasure from darren , where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else . and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family . the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life , and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on . this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her , where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for . anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may , as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series . as she do not have much movies in her career resume , the mother has put her on the critic 's attention . daniel craig , on the other hand , had took on a similar role in his movie career , such as sylvia ( 2003 ) and enduring love ( 2004 ) . if his reprising role of james bond fails , film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career , and the mother is one of them . the mother may not be everyone 's favorite , but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones , accompanied by butter and jam .
i was given the opportunity to see this 1926 film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses . this paramount has a mighty wurlitzer ' organ  also magnificently restored -- that was used to accompany the silent films of the day . we were fortunate enough to have dennis james , a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film . the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen . this was greta garbo 's first american film . she was only 20 years old but already had 6 swedish films in her repertoire . it is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star ; even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the mise-en-scene , it was necessary to leave much to the imagination . modern audiences , for the most part , do not understand silent films acting was different then , with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions . therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times  the acting is seen as hammy ' and over-done  but it was simply the style of the period . garbo , with all her subtlety , did much to usher in the new age of acting : she could say more with a half-closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug . she exemplifies the truism that ` a picture is worth a thousand words . ' even though this is garbo 's first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands : this was mgm filmmaking at its best . the sets and costumes were magnificent . the special effects  which by today 's standards are pretty feeble  were still electrifying and amazing . the script by vicente blasco ibanez ( from the novel by entre naranjos ) would seem to be tailor made for garbo ; it showcases her strengths , magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with : a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part . her co-star was mgm 's answer to rudolph valentino : ricardo cortez . he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film : allow himself to look unnactractive , appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully . there are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted  especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo . notable among them are lucien littlefield as cupido ' and martha mattox as doña bernarda brull . ' this is when the extraordinary cinematographer , william h. daniels , met garbo  they went on to make 20 films together . ( he was the cinematographer on 157 films and his career spanned five decades ! ) he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known : the divine garbo . without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was . seeing this film is an all-too-rare opportunity : if you ever have the chance , do not miss it .
first and foremost i would like to say that i 'm a huge sarah silverman fan , and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me . everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form , maybe not directly funny , but the situation and the delivery are what counts . if you liked jesus is magic then i do n't see how you would n't like this . it has that same flow and that same rhythm . true it 's only for the true fans , but if you are you 'll be pleased . again only for the true fans , there 's no way around that . if you 're not used to her style then you would n't get why this is funny . however , it is , and i hope you think so too .
that kid a is such a babe ; this movie was no titan a.e . ( of which it is in many ways modeled after ) but still came off as entertaining , the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wan na cry ; includes some of the most entertaining characters i 've seen in disney film
raggedy ann and raggedy andy the movie is about dolls that come to life when the humans are n't around . in this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named babette from the captain of pirates . on their way they journey though deep dark woods , taffy pit , and even looney land . will the aide of their new friend the camel with wrinkled knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him ? how will they escape the kookoo king and his henchmen ! ? what will their owner marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys ? delightful surprises await the two adventurers . all scores are out of a possible 10 : story : 8 - very cute . dolls that come to life when the master is n't around . not just that because they go out into many many different places , but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen . meeting new characters , going to different places finding new friends , its great . the characters all work so well in this too and who does n't love pirates ? ! acting : 8 - every character suits their voice so well . specifically the marlon brando taffy pit enemy , the greed . the french doll has a very uptight french accent , the evil hitler-esquire king kookoo ( whos got hair that resembles simpson 's sideshow bob ) plays his role very well , and the sorrow old black man voice for camel works perfectly . why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones ? music : 10 - nothing short of perfection here . the songs have been in my head for years , and re-watching it nearly 20 years later , i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from . joe raposo of `` sesame street '' fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well . editing : 6 - heh , this is where it 'll get confusing . i mean how far did the raggedy 's walk anyway ? a lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there 's no telling who the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie , but it does follow some sort of path and you know they 'll eventually get to where they need to go , its just pretty hard to follow at times . uniqueness : 8 - between this and unico i 'd have to say there 's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to . mainly the scary parts . i 've probably mentioned already how older movies were much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor . outside of the south park movie and some disney films there 's almost no animated musicals , or good ones of that coming out so its very unique . worth : 8- its classic . worth the hunt to get a good copy thats for sure , but the vhs copies are probably all stretched out by now . the dvd version is sold on ebay all the time and it 'll definitely be something you 'll watch more than once . if anything get it for the nostalgia purposes . overall score ( not an average ) : 8 - its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today . its characters are all unique and the songs are great . so great you might find yourself humming them time and time again . give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today ! reviewer 's insight ( including bias ) : this is n't like the raggedy ann tv series made a decade later . this was way more darker and real world . the effects in this seem like a lot of other acid-trip cartoons from the 70 's , in particular , yellow submarine . still , its given me memories i 'll never forget , and might still influence things today . it was n't easy to find but it 'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of dvds and videos forever .
i happily admit that i 'm a sucker for a beautiful film , and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film . not one the length of gojoe though , even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i 've seen since the korean period piece musa . however , gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images ( as does musa ... do n't which to imply a contrast ) - it 's second greatest strength is superb acting , and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy . i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end , but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way . vague ones , but definitely thoughts : p one department in which the film could have been better is the action . there 's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film , but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups , and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground . it does create some very intense and impressive visuals , but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves , something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone . still , the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i 've seen for quite some time . recommended !
low budget brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star , becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much . good cast and a sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we have all been here before . several scenes are a bit hysterical and o'connor 's voice sounds a lot like mini mouse ! she disappeared from sight soon after making this movie - so life can imitated art ! a must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though .
i was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers . i saw it one late night on tv and it hit the spot - i actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared . yet i remember it pretty well , with a nice twist or two , and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm . michael pollard looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career , and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead . i definitely recommend it as a rental , although some of the themes , which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 , now may seem tame , which is a shame , considering that contemporary `` edginess '' is often just used as a necessary marketing tool , sort of like clamoring just to get noticed .
okay , this show is nothing but awesome ! it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses . jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role ! he is gunna be big in hollywood . he has a bright future ahead ! this show better last a long time because i really love this show , and i hope that it has a lot of success ! it is so interesting . i have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it 's finally here , and it 's great ! i tape it , too . i can watch it whenever i want now ! too bad its only on once a week though . i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day ! hope you all like this show ! ~ashley~
an original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the library of congress , and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005 . according to current reviews that i 've found online , the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact ; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release , in order to pass the new york state censors . i have also read that a dvd is `` expected in 2006 '' and one can only hope ! if we 're really luckily , it will include comparisons between the 2 versions . note that the released censored version was originally available on laserdisc , which i have seen . stanwyck rules !
it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to albuquerque . gabby hayes ( juke , sounds like duke ) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general , with his girlfriend pearl being an exception . he then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of pearl , who is the town barber , no less , and who claims if everyone followed his example , she would be out of business . this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film . gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers , but is a definite plus to this one . it 's too bad he was n't in more of the better randoph scott westerns to help lighten up randy 's usual iron-jawed demeanor . also on this stage are randy ( cole armin ) , his future wife ( cathrine craig , as celia wallace ) , whom he is getting acquainted with , and a little girl ( myrtle ) , to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of randy 's wheelchair-bound uncle john armin ( george cleveland ) , who essentially runs the town . randy soon learns that his uncle , and by extension , himself , is not exactly popular among the town folk . he does , however , quickly form a useful friendship with gabby . after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor , celia wallace , and the associated murder , he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for celia and her brother ted ( russell hayden ) , instead of for uncle john . as his rival 's prospects rise , uncle john decides to plant an informant ( barbara britton , as letty tyler ) in the wallace office , to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run . when this does n't work , he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office , for which randy is blamed . unfortunately , when the fire was discovered , randy was in letty 's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle john . myrtle and letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered . this puts him and letty in the dog house with celia ( his apparent beau ) and ted ( who hopes to woo letty ) . this news also ends uncle john 's trust in letty as an informant , and he suggests she leave town . instead , she switches sides and tells the wallaces why randy was in her apartment . uncle john tries once again to sabotage their ore run , and when that fails , there is a general shootout in town . you can guess the results . the plot is well constructed and executed , with complicated relationships between the principles , and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome , with the sometimes aid of his associates . at least , randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice . uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination , but arrogantly trusted that a woman would n't have the guts to carry out her threat . the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women , as well as little myrtle , much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival , as uncle john put it . it seems odd that barbara britton , the `` bad '' girl , gets top female billing over catherine craig , randy 's love interest . barbara 's on camera time was much more limited . those who grew up on the lassie tv series featuring george cleveland as `` gramps '' will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain . we may wonder if his wheelchair-bound status has a bearing on this persona . this leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild west . without apparent family to help support him ( except randy ) , he ca n't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town . on the other hand , from his conversations , he probably achieved his status as the town `` boss '' before becoming wheelchair-bound .
this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies . asides from it 's little plot , the weak drama and bits of comedy antics , the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action . kept me entertained from beginning until the end . i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie . having an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong . this modern action film is highly recommended ! !
why ca n't this type of compact , entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century ? it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way . the cast is a great ensemble . william powell exhibits true star quality . who knows -- perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles . he is a joy to watch . one also can see why eugene pallette made more than 200 films . he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch . mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role . all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes . i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one . bravo !
the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game . so many people have seen this film and just do n't get it , and i do n't understand why . while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me . i will try to explain this without any spoilers , but be forewarned , i do talk about things that happen in the movie . * * * * possible spoilers * * * * be forewarned ! * * * * his is a life of `` large moves '' versus `` small moves '' . he chooses natalia to be his queen , and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy . listen closely to that description . when someone asks him a question , he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves . ( the flashbacks are beautifully lit , by the way . ) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well , for they give not only his point of view as a child , but the point of view of the other character as well . it 's stunning . various characters become either his helpers or his enemies , pawns , bishops and knights , their actions enlightening you as to who 's side they are on . even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on . beautifully done . i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin , but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end . this film is constantly working on many levels , which is why i endorse it . it was a treat and a joy to watch . if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh . the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces .
first off i 'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over-the-top . a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would 've made this movie much less cheesy . but overall i think it 's one of the better b-movies . tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful , not to mention incredibly beautiful . though this movie is missing the all-important nude factor , there are several other movies at which to view her . but here she gets all evil-hotness , especially towards the end as she 's walking away from the engulfed scarecrow . also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend . yes it 's a low budget b-movie . but out of all of them i 've seen , this is definitely one of my very top favorites .
a charming romantic comedy . the plot is a little too complicated -- i tried to summarize it three times and i ca n't . suffice to say it 's worth seeing . the movie is funny , beautiful -- the plot is totally unrealistic but it works . everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great -- it creates a sweet , romantic feel through the entire film . the acting is great -- robert downey jr. and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it . ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine . if you 're a sucker for good , sweet sentimental films ( like me ) , catch this one . also downey looks great in his underwear ! extra bonuses -- the title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song `` after all '' sung by cher and peter cetera .
i had seen lady with red hair back when it appeared , and did n't remember it as something to cherish . the truth is that , notwithstanding its base in a true story , its screen play is silly and unbelievable . the real merit of the picture is the cast . a constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30 's and 40 's make a background for the delicate , intelligent work of the always underrated miriam hopkins , and the wonderful , spectacular performance of claude rains , who , as usual , is the best thing in the picture . what an actor ! he never won an oscar , but he is in the good company of chaplin , garbo and hitchcock . perhaps lady with red hair contains his best work in films . see it and enjoy him .
.... rather well done , actually -- attack the evil villains in their lair , stop a little big horn style ambush , save the day via the waterboys ' bugling , works for me . stiff upper british lip and all that . so how does it play on a dvd 66 years later ? struck me as being like a western , subbing apaches or sioux for the thugs , and the us cavalry for the imperial british army . it 's very colonial in it 's outlook , you know ? white man 's burden and all that ? kipling certainly would have approved . cary grant , fairbanks and maclaglen play it as broadly as possible , putting some buddy buddy slapstick into the mix between the shootings and brawlings for good measure . ( i had no idea it was joan fontaine as the token army wife -- did they leave some of her scenes on the cutting room floor ? very short- ) none of them were aiming for an oscar here -- in fact grant was not at his best in a few scenes -- but sod it , it still works . and where else would ben casey wind up as an indian bugler ? only in hollywood . def . check this out if you like adventure and pseudo-western style antics . it was done by a bunch of pros , well i might add . * * * outta * * * *
back in the day of the big studio system , the darndest casting decisions were made . good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner . had i been casting the film , the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer . his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing . stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan . margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen , he did four films with her . but is only this one where neither of them dies . sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york . in fact sullavan 's husband was stewart 's good friend henry fonda back then . i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty . stewart in the mortal storm was german , but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out . but if you can accept stewart , than you 'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch . the plot is pretty simple , a man and woman working in a department store in budapest do n't get along in person . but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other . also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife . though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self , the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut . bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions . he makes himself very scarce . and joseph schildkraut , who is always good , is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan . you really hate people like that , i 've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day . sad that it pays off a good deal of the time .
i loved this movie and will watch it again . original twist to plot of man vs man vs self . i think this is kurt russell 's best movie . his eyes conveyed more than most actors words . perhaps there 's hope for mankind in spite of government intervention ?
the premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the united states .. this was a highly combustible scenario in america whereby two entirely different cultures collided . what justified such heinously depraved actions anyway ? .. as this film presents the scene , ( while hickock and smith drank ) these two men were not intoxicated , nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs ! ! it was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation .. basically , these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect ... anytime past 1975 , we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment ... however , this incident takes place in 1959 ! ! this dreadful revelation sideswiped us , and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics ! ! with the recent release of the movie `` capote '' based on truman capote , who was the creator of the documentary `` in cold blood '' , the american people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film ! ! robert blake played the role of perry smith , one of the villains in this movie ... this is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life ! ! `` in cold blood '' centers on the element of the unexplained ... there was no vengeance involved , there was no material gain to be acquired , there was no potential for social advancement here either , this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means ! ! the situational diatribes which hickock and smith lamented about were always ambiguous ! ! under the circumstances , why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent kansas family ? .. will geer ( grandpa walton ) plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness ! ! his argument is thoroughly convincing ... his contention being : `` these two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours '' this is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if i were to be one of the members of the jury ! ! absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime ! ! it was capote 's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the american public 's attention ! ! as it turn out , it was a harbinger of things to come .. `` in cold blood '' did just that ! ! this incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960 's ! ! such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical americans for the future ! ! ! truman capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book , ( which was a best seller ) and , with this documentary as well ... the acting in this film by robert blake and scott wilson , as well as people like john forsythe , was incredible ! ! the director , richard brooks , ( `` cat on a hot tin roof '' , `` blackboard jungle '' `` elmer gantry '' and `` key largo '' to name but a few ! ! ) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie ! ! i think that `` in cold blood '' is one of the best films in the history of movies ! ! the film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics , and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level ! ! .... this movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence ! ! our nation 's ideologies are incredibly different now , than they were in 1959 ! ! this movie introduces the american people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system ! ! i recommend to everyone that they see this movie ... '' in cold blood '' was the focal point to the film `` capote '' ! think about it , making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in hollywood ! ! in the case of `` in cold blood '' it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant , intellectually elevating , and , of course , it goes without saying , `` in cold blood '' was utterly spellbinding , as well as a totally remarkable movie ! !
this is simply the funniest movie i 've seen in a long time . the bad acting , bad script , bad scenery , bad costumes , bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter . so it 's not gon na win an oscar but if you 've got beer and friends round then you ca n't go wrong .
before sunrise has many remarkable things going on , almost too many to fit into one review like this , but it 's suffice to say that it 's one of the most observant character studies of the nineties , maybe even in all of contemporary cinema , to be observant not about love , per-say , so much as it 's about a human connection . how does one fall in love at first sight ? no one does , at least that 's deep down the consensus that linklater wants to show with his film . and * yet * there is the possibility of as intense a connection , of a bond that can form in those that are young and with many ideas that can be expressed articulately and with a breadth of cynicism and is somehow very tender and true at the same time . linklater here gives us the story of celine and jessie , a french girl and an american boy who get off the same train heading to vienna , and on the way there start to talking about things , at first arbitrary , then personal ( jessie seeing death for the first time in his great grandfather ) . jessie persuades celine to go along with him on a night out on the 'town ' , in vienna , until his plane the next morning . before sunrise gives jessie and celine , in the midst of the gorgeous vienna scenery and locales to go on and on about subjects that have a lot of importance , and in a sense is about the act of having conversations , of what it 's like to watch people having one leading into another and another . here it 's often about relationships and commitments , as jessie and celine tell stories sometimes somewhat inconsequential , or seemingly so , and another that may tell a lot about their essential qualities . we hear confessions of desires for other loves , or what were n't really loves , of being part of a family or part of an upbringing that may or may not inform how you 'll love your life , of what it means to believe or not believe in some religious form , or just to have some connection to any faith and the soul ( i loved the bit about the quakers in the church ) , and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism . jessie may be more responsible for that last part , but what 's fascinating about the film is that it 's never exactly cynical itself , just commenting upon cynicism that lays in the concerns of men and women at that age of their lives . meanwhile , it 's always great to see ethan hawke and julie delpy in these roles , where they 're not incessantly annoying in that 90s generation-x mode , but are the kinds of people where if not in the central conceit of the film , which is n't a bad one at all but a necessary one , one might think to find walking along the streets of a city somewhere . the conceit is that of an old romantic picture ala brief encounter , only here intimacy is expressed in the central characters either between each other , where sweet asides are actually acceptable ( `` i have to tell you a secret '' , jessie says , and then leans in for a kiss , ho-ho ) , or in the little moments that pop up with other people along the way . i loved the scene with the poet , where it 's very cinematic a thing to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words at his disposal , or with the palm reader and how the reactions from jessie and celine are that we might share , but really are seeing them do it first-hand . all the while hawke and delpy embody the roles interestingly- we can see how neuroses are being formed already for their adult lives- as it may lead off into the future ... featuring splendid cinematography and a script with an ear for natural wit and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of happiness , however self-contained , as it may lead into something more . who 's to say you ca n't suddenly be attached to someone , if only for less than 24 hours , and be that much more attached than a married couple ? this is perhaps linklater 's thesis , but there 's more to it than just that . it 's a very dense film , and one that will have me calling back to it repeatedly . one scene especially , which is both cheesy and brilliant is when the two of them are talking 'on the phone ' in front of each other mimicking their expositions might go to the other 's friend . a+
oh , the sixties . there were some interesting films . i was more of a movie goer then . i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater . i also saw this short film , `` the legend of the boy and the eagle '' . i have been searching for this film for years . it was truly inspiring . surprisingly , i was finally able to gather more information from your site . thank you ........ i 'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture . i too did not remember the disney film . i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney . i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime . i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film ? is it available on dvd ? this is a must see for all generations ! ! !
superb cast , more please ! if you can catch just about anything else written by plater ( or starring these wonderful actors ) . for anyone who does n't know plater has a real feeling for jazz , my recommendation is to see the 'beiderbecke ' trilogy whenever you can . `` there 's three kinds of jazz - hot , cool and 'what time does the tune start ? ' ''
this 1939 film from director john ford and writer lamar trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer abraham lincoln , his trials ( literally ) and his tribulations . it 's a sentimental film , reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking . the casting of henry fonda as lincoln seems a mistake , for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part , even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he 's way too handsome for honest abe , who was famously homely . it 's a good try from fonda , who 's nothing if not sincere , but his miscasting throws the entire film off . the supporting cast is excellent , though , and includes alice brady , ward bond and donald meek . but ford is too reverential in his treatment of lincoln , who is presented as just shy of a saint , and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top .
this one has a lot going for it - sinatra , styne , cahn , pamela britten -and a lesser amount of dross - iturbi , grayson - plus a little ho hum - kelly . it was sinatra 's first real movie where the producer 's spent a buck and you could see it on screen ( previously he 'd appeared in two low-budgeters , higher and higher and step lively ) but if they 'd only relied on the sinatra pipes and deep sixed grayson 's plus iturbi 's ego-tripping piano spots we 'd have been left with a much tighter movie and a better showcase for sinatra . as it is he scores heavily in all his songs from the two duets with kelly - we hate to leave , i begged her - to his own solos , what makes the sunset , the charm of you and i fall in love too easily . despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth the budget .
i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care-a-lot . now , after so many years have passed , i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it . if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children , then you should , just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care-a-lot ! the songs , especially `` forever young '' are very sweet and memorable . parents , i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be ! when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv , you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these .
emilio miraglio 's `` the red queen kills seven times '' ( 1972 ) is just about the most perfect example of a giallo that i have ever seen , mixing all the requisite elements into one sinister stew indeed . first of all , and of paramount importance for me , it has a complex , twisty plot that ultimately makes perfect sense , and the killer here does not come completely out of left field at the end . the story , concerning a series of gruesome murders ( you already know how many from the film 's title , right ? ) that takes place in seeming fulfillment of an ancient prophecy concerning two sisters , is an involving one , and the murderer , a red-cloaked figure with the insane laugh of a madwoman , is both frightening and memorable . every great giallo requires some lovely lead actresses , and here we have quite an assortment , headed by the ridiculously beautiful barbara bouchet as one of the two sisters and , in one of her earlier roles , sybil danning , as a lustful tramp at barbara 's fashion house . another necessary ingredient of a superior giallo is a catchy , hummable score , and bruno nicolai provides one for this film that should stay with you for days . gorgeous scenery ? check again . filmed largely in wurzburg , germany , the picture is a treat for the eye indeed . ok , ok , but what about those murders ? after all , is n't that what gialli are all about ? well , i 'm pleased to report that most viewers should be well satisfied with the various knifings , shootings , impalements and other carnage that this film tastefully dishes out ... not to mention the crypts , freaky dream sequence , rats and bats ( and lots of 'em , too ! ) , the drug references , a rape scene , the obligatory red herrings and , in the person of ugo pagliai , a hunky leading man for the female viewers . as i said , a perfect giallo . and even better , this dvd is from the fine folks at no shame , and you know what that means : a gorgeous print and loads of extras , to boot ! thanks , guys !
lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami . she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies . the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it up . it 's a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up . the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane . there could have more to the plane but other than that , the whole movie was pretty good . i especially liked the ending because it was heart-stopping . i did n't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it . for me , this movie just took off .
let me start by saying i have never reviewed a movie on imdb before ; however , i am in the video biz myself . and coming from that perceptive ; i can say , without a shadow of a doubt that this film is what a short should be . it has a very good story and another thing i love- ( an even better twist ending ) . opening was very well done , i loved video chosen for it and how it was edited . i am not a fan of b & w but the way this film uses the effect it works . and with any film that is all that matters . the flow of the film works perfectly and editing was very well done . from a technical side of things ( which is side i normally work on ) everything is also very well done . there is no major tech . stuff to point out . only minor one i have is that the end credits are a little bouncy . this is probably due to a rendering issue . let me also say that i would have prefer to seen more of the love scene but i am guy ( so you can chalk that up to a guy factor ) . so overall i rate it a 9/10 . it is worth the watch if you fan of indies and/or short films . ps . sorry for bad grammar or spelling .
first of all i 've got to give it to the people that got this thing together . 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that making a movie that dares to be controversial about it takes a great deal of guts . it 's a shame , although not surprising , that the movie was banned in the us . that being said i think that the movie is superb with a couple of weak moments . the movie starts up with the iranian segment which turns out to be somewhat reminiscent of majid majidi 's work ( the absolutely beautiful `` heaven 's children '' and `` the color of paradise '' ) . much like those 2 films the clip shows what happened through the innocent eyes of a class of afgan refugees in iran . absolutely beautiful clip . same goes for sean penn 's clip which is superb as well . but just as some of the clips are beutiful others are absolutely brutal . alejandro gonzáles iñárritu does the mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching `` amores perros '' he does it as brutal as he can . most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background . those sounds are of the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes , those who called home from the burning towers and left messages for their families , those who were angry .... and he combines this with flashes of people jumping from the towers . a very hard clip to watch and one that you wo n't forget . some clips could turn out to be very hard to watch for americans as some of the clips could be interpreted as `` you 're not the only ones that are suffering '' . in particular the egyptian and british clips that not only say that but turn the tables and say how much suffering the us has caused to other people . i will also make a special mention to the clips from bosnia-herzegovina , france , india and japan ( although this last one may seem terribly out of place it actually is n't ) . however , not all the clips are great and i make a special mention on the clip from israel which , in my opinion , is extremely weak . while the idea was good ( a reporter is at the scene of a terrorist attack in tel aviv but his story gets bumped because of what happened in new york is something that a lot of us who live in countries at war can relate to ) the realization is terrible . the clip ends up as just some entertainment reporter trying to get some air-time at all costs , a guy saying he 's a witness and hoping that he can go on tv , and soldiers and paramedics shouting just `` because '' . the clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation . if you happen to have the chance to see it then you should , that is , unless you 're a conservative in which case you 'd better stay out as you might get offended . but if you 're not then you might learn how many of us outside the us lived through 9/11 .
this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures . loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences . ken , rock n'roll fanatic , marries kyoto , a japanese girl , so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires . the marriage is only expected to be temporary , that is , until kyoto gains legal status again . but , ken , who seems to be lost in every relationship , takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out . this , despite his friend 's urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n ' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that . but kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing , and does n't expect to be married to ken all that long . not only that , she is homesick and wants to return to japan . it 's sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that , except the one time he thinks he 's found someone to feel that way about , the girl is n't expecting to stay that long . it 's not that she does n't like ken , it 's just that she 's used to a whole 'nother way of life . she says , `` i ca n't tell him the way i feel in english , and ken ca n't tell me the way he feels in japanese . '' it 's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack . i picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films , tokyo pop . and , for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time , check out tokyo pop ( a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band ) , except it 's a movie with a happy ending .
olivier , kosentsev , richardson , coranado , zefferelli , and almerayeda have all directed hamlet but branagh 's the only one who got it right . this is the only film of `` hamlet '' that contains the full four hours of william shakespeare 's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story . not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but branagh 's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out . examples of this include gerarde depardue as ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say `` yes my lord '' as polonius asks him to spy on leartes . this also included billy crystal as the grave digger , robin williams as osric , jack lemmon as marcellous , and charlton heston as the actor . branagh 's performance of the act 4 scene 4 soliloquy ( which again is usually cut out ) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows . it is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding . branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience . this is a must see for everyone who enjoy 's good story telling , brilliant acting , and incredible direction . all of these part of william shakespeares greatest triumph .
i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now . i must really love it , right ? well , not really . i was a surfer earlier in my life , and i loved the sport . to this day , i am fascinated by good surfing . riding giants has plenty of that , and thus i am a sucker for the thing . but i definitely have some bones to pick with it . ( peralta , you listening ? ) . first , the movie has too little faith in its subject matter . the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined . very , very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish . peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic , cut-and-pace method . it gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot mavericks in northern california . not a single wave is ridden start to finish . almost the entire section on mavericks ( one third of the movie ) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack . i can understand the effect peralta was trying to achieve with mavericks , as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop , but he goes way too far . mavericks is not just a bad acid trip . waves are actually ridden there , even with great performances . it would have been good to see some of them . if peralta thinks this is a grand sport ( and i am sure he does ) , then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much ? at times , the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable . there is one fast clip in the section on peahi in hawaii , which i still can not understand . even if i run it on slow motion on dvd , the image is too fast to be decipherable . it must be a couple of frames in length at the max . second , have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement ? it is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors ' version on dvd . these guys sound like two over-the-top valley girls . the same sentiment shows up in the main production . every thing is always so goddamn `` amazing '' etc . one character in particular is just plain obnoxious -- sam george , the editor of surfer magazine , who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say . he is a super drag on the movie . there is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie . i mean , just to get the old movie shots they have , and also , all of the interviews . the movie is a great story , and i think it is generally captivating entertainment . thematically it is well laid out , with the three parts centering around greg noll , jeff clark , and laird hamilton respectively . there are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal . in the directors ' narration , they say it is a new type of 3d technology , and it really works . the three principle characters shine , both in their interviews and in the water . as an athlete , laird hamilton is a revelation . he rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that i have only seen michael jordan do in basketball . and too , the story of his meeting his father is a gem . it really touched me . it is just that the movie could have been so much more . the very last part of the movie , when the credits roll , gives a hint of what it could have been . there are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack . ( the soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish , though you may like it if you are fan of the modern , frenetic school of rock . ) anyway there 's my two cents ...
i thought this was an awesome movie . the theme song is sweet ! : ) anyway , the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning , when everything should have been normal . it was very weird and unrealistic . the big cable company is mainly what i 'm talking about . apart from that , the movie was very creative . i think that all the acting was well done , the actors acted out their characters ' personalities perfectly . everything fit together well . it really is a shame that their is n't a soundtrack . that would have been great ! because this is a canadian film , and because it is one of my favorites , i give this movie a 10 out of 10 !
i was so surprised when i saw this film so much underrated ... i understand why some of you dislike this movie . its pace is slow , a characteristic of japanese films . nevertheless , if you are absorbed in the film like me , you will find this not a problem at all . i must say this is the best comedy i have ever seen . `` shall we dansu ? '' is often considered a masterpiece of japanese comedies . it is very different from hollywood ones , e.g . austin powers or scary movies , in which a gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes . rather , it is light-hearted , a movie that makes you feel good . i love the movie because it makes me feel `` real '' . the plot is straightforward yet pleasing . i was so delighted seeing that sugiyama ( the main role ) has found the meaning of life in dancing . before i watched the film i was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork . i felt lost . however , this film made me think of the bright side of life . i believed i was in the same boat of sugiyama ; if he could find himself in his hobby , why could n't i ? it reminded me of `` exploring my own future '' and discovering the happiness in my daily life . it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers . while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect , i kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really `` alive '' , learning to dance as the film goes on . over all , this film is encouraging and heart-warming . as a comedy , it does its job perfectly . it definitely deserves 10 stars . and yes aoki is funny : -d
steven spielberg ( at 24 ) had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called `` the psychiatrist '' , starring roy thinnes . one episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man ( clu gulager in his best performance ) who is dying of cancer . both episodes were stunning , visually unlike anything else on tv , and emotionally complex and adult . the creators of `` the psychiatrist '' were richard levinson and william link , who created `` columbo '' and also produced its first season . peter falk insisted on first rank , experienced tv directors for the first season of `` columbo '' , like bernard kowalski and jack smight . but falk agreed to spielberg after watching part of the clu gulagher episode of `` the psychiatrist '' . spielberg says on the dvd of `` duel '' that he loved steven bochco 's `` murder by the book '' script ( based on a levinson/link story ) , and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature , even thought he had a lot less money to work with . this episode of `` columbo '' is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other `` columbo '' episode , even though the series always used top directors . spielberg manages to keep the great falk and cassidy from hamming it up too much , but both actors are still a lot of fun . spielberg also gets fine supporting work from martin milner , rosemary forsyth and barbara colby . all the performances have a freshness and vitality about them . the only `` columbo '' episode that was close to being as well directed is the `` by dawn 's early light '' episode with patrick mcgoohan ( directed by harvey hart ) . i think the two episodes of `` the psychiatrist '' and this episode of `` columbo '' suggest spielberg has n't developed technically all that much as a director . he was great from the beginning . in a `` combat ! '' dvd commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring albert salmi , robert altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director . maybe the same is true of spielberg .
ed harris 's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence , that is , he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it , and that includes the formidable sean connery . the movie , which is more than a bit sanctimonious , comes alive only in the scenes when harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict . it is breathtaking , a master class in artistic control . the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable , as is fishbourne , but the story itself packs no wallop . the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers . this is the engine which drives the story , right or wrong , and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end . still , worth watching to see harris in action .
this movie is one among the very few indian movies , that would never fade away with the passage of time , nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish , even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the p.t . styled film songs . the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety . gone are the days of great cinema , when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it , while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes . some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity , like the instance , when meena kumari refuses to say `` yes '' as an approval for nikah ( marriage bond ) and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy . at the moment , raj kumar follows her , and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumar ........ kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinema 's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years . he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena 's close ups , because meena kumari , the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971 .
despite of the success in comedy or drama , the turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller . `` okul-d @ bbe '' are good examples for the awful horror turkish films . but if you watch `` gen '' you will understand that it is a strike . the atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark . also the special features are colorful and not cheap . the soundtracks fit the movie , but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary . as a result `` gen '' does not add any difference to horror movies , but it does not disappoint thriller fans . in this respect it is a success for yesilcam and turkey . ( 7/10 )
rumour has it that around the time that abba  the multi-award winning swedish disco favourites  's star had reached its zenith , the band grew disillusioned with singing in english and yearned to perform in their native tongue . soon after , problems began to emerge in the onetime-wed locked-watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent . the band dissolved , albeit unofficially , in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists . although they have never admitted that there 's any truth in those rumours , the fact remains that abba would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue . if you want to appeal to the largest money-making media market in the entire world , then you must cater for english speaking audiences . it 's amazing for me how such a small island that 's located a stone-throw away from the european continent could have created perhaps the most recognised , although not most widely spoken , language in the world . everyone speaks a little bit of english ; whether it be simply 'hello ' or a common swear word - you 'll find an english speaker almost everywhere . pedro galindo obviously did n't agree , because trampa infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget dvd . that 's a real shame , because it 's actually a decent slasher movie that 's a lot better than many of its english-speaking genre compatriots . the film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel . two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown . after some suspense and a couple of near misses , one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously . next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town . nacho and mauricio are fiercest rivals and mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft-spoken opponent , but as of yet he has n't succeeded . later that night , whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend alejandra and his buddy charly , mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis . he says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect . nacho is at first reluctant because alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness , but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees ; much to the distaste of his morally superior partner . they plan to head out to the remote region of filo de caballo , because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear . mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary . after visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store-keeper , the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland . hunters become hunted as they learn that the 'bear ' is actually a homicidal vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy . what started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin . i picked up trampa whilst studying in madrid from a mexican student who lived in the dorm room next-door to me . i remember that the copy i watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled , which meant i never got to see the final scenes . thankfully i came across the budget dvd recently on amazon and immediately added it to my collection . gallindo 's slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot , which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies . it is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the arnold schwarzenegger classic predator . this is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily-masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic-stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac 's playground . despite gallindo 's obvious awareness of genre platitudes ( the bogeyman even uses a claw-fingered glove a la freddy kruegar ) ; trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template . whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category , the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown . from here on , the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film , which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you . the last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry 'the majorettes ' , which is not necessarily a good thing . as is the case with many latin films ( especially spanish flicks by almodovar and amenabar ) , trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story , which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer 's throat . over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner . it 's a sugar-coated point , but it 's handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature . trampa may be cheesy , but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers . the killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white valentine-style mask and the attempts at originality just about work . it may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy , but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing .
while there are n't any talking animals , big lavish song production numbers , or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance , and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio . if you thought think `` the castaways '' or `` the island at the top of the world '' were n't identical , or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis , then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin ' cartoon .
i do n't know what it is i find so endearing about this film , but the first time i saw it , i wanted to see how it ended . i 'm not a big fan of paul winfield nor of war-dramas , but i was truly wondering just how and when winfield would find his child . all he knows is that the boy has green eyes . truth be told , i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while , but this movie is somewhat of one man 's odyssey after the pains of war . winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories . there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront . why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me .
i do n't think i 'll ever understand the hate for renny harlin . 'die hard 2 ' was cool , and he gave the world 'cliffhanger ' , one of the most awesome action movies ever . that 's right , you little punks , 'cliffhanger ' rules , and we all know it . sly plays gabe walker , a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting ' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend , hal tucker ( michael rooker ) , assist in a rescue on a mountain peak . walker obviously came back at a convenient time , because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric qualen ( john lithgow ) . qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u.s. government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back ... essentially , 'cliffhanger ' is another 'die hard ' clone . just trade in the confines of nakatomi plaza to the open mountain ranges of the rocky mountains , complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal . naturally , that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough , as stallone 's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease , and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects . after all , is n't that what action movies are all about ? 'cliffhanger ' is one of the most exciting action movies around . a showcase of great scenes and stunts . one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i 've ever seen in a movie , and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning , it maintains its action awesomeness . john lithgow 's lead villain is entertaining , and one bad dude . quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever . 'cliffhanger ' is easily one of stallone 's best efforts , definitely renny harlin 's best effort , and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
i can see why this film was oscar-nominated for best live action short , as it was constructed masterfully . even if you do n't particularly like the blues ( though to me , this sounded much more like jazz ) , you can easily appreciate this film . it is simply very well made , though for the life of me , i ca n't see why director gjon mili only got to direct one film -- this one . in other words , the film is nominated and yet the director did n't get any sort of career boost . as for the black performers , i could understand this not causing their careers to shift into high gear , as unfortunately most of white society have indifference ( or worse ) for blacks or `` that kind of music '' . if you do watch this film , if you are n't particularly enjoying the earlier portion , skip ahead to about the 5:50 mark -- where it picks up considerably . when the lady stopped singing and the performers began to improvise , the pace improved quite a bit .
the first and only time i saw the woman in black was i think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on tv back in 1989 . it was christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church . i was quite young at the time but i 'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father ! . there are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there 's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every hollywood movie , so every creak , thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there 's no distraction . another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there 's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on . this is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door ! a superb ghost story , i 've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on tv i cant believe the bbc has deleted it after ( to my knowledge ) only one showing !
this has to be , hands down , hats off , one of the most uproarious comedies ever made . starting with the animated blowing , popping bubbles , the entrance to the daytime awards , the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet , the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech , the venomous comments uttered by the actor 's jealous co-stars and producer , under phony smiles . now that is only in the first few minutes . then , all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous . ridiculous in a good way , no , make that a great way . this was the first time i 'd seen the always charming teri hatcher . while i may not be a follower of desperate housewives , she herself is always watchable - same goes for lois & clark . not a huge follower , but if i run across an episode i 'd watch it . robert downey , jr. , does a great turn as slimy , smarmy , snaky , sycophantic david seaton barnes , the producer who 'd give his right eye to see sally field 's celeste talbert leave the show , if only to finally get to get it on with cathy moriarty 's montana moorehead . moriarty absolutely shines in this movie , just as she had everywhere else she 's appeared . here , all she has to do is scream `` i hate you i hate you you creep ! '' or give one of her anti-celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin , and she has me rolling in the aisles . yes , cathy moriarty is a very gifted actress , and one hell of a comedienne . sally field gratefully departs from the usual 70-mm-sized lifetime tragedy of the week movies , and we 're all reminded why she is who she is today , having started off in comedy afraid of nothing . her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor , but like a caterpillar in a cocoon , the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was . the thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy , serious roles , that you associate them with their character and you ca n't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen . how lucky were the producers to land carrie fisher , if only for a glorified cameo . she does n't realize what a presence she bears on screen . she takes a role which , in the hands of a lesser actress , could easily have been forgotten , but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself . how lucky was elisabeth shue to get thrown in the middle of all this ! at the time , she was n't really known for much . adventures in babysitting was kind of cute ( yes , i was dragged to an evening show for which i had to pay full price ) , but she did n't hold my attention - - much . but here , she makes the most of her character - star 's niece who falls in love with the star 's ex-co-star-and-lover who , of course , turns out to be the niece 's father , and the star turns out to be the poor girl 's mother . i 'll stop there - i feel i practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy , or at least a novela . if you 've seen it , then reminisce . if you have n't , you 've missed a real classic , but not really . the dvd 's are made of a material that 'll last for at least 25 years , and this movie is timeless , so what the hell .
i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this # 4 . the 900+ theater was full and at the end it received a standing ovation . this was classic peter falk if you are a falk fan and displayed a lot of chemistry between the peter falk and paul reiser characters . the film 's title seemed to long and too odd sounding to me . i am surprised this did n't make it into general release . this was far better than the majority of junk that the major studios throw at you . maybe too adult in that it was geared to the baby boomer and senior audience . a lot of people could relate to situations in this movie . this will probably enjoy a revival of sorts years from now when people look back at this film and consider it a kind of a gem . i would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it .
when you compare what brian de palma was doing in the 80 's to what passes for entertainment today , his films keep looking better and better . `` dressed to kill , `` blow out '' , `` body double '' , `` scarface '' and `` carlito 's way '' are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers . the guy had a long run of better than average films . this is pure hitchcock with an 80 's dash of lurid perversion , an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists , huge helpings of style , a stunning pino donaggio score , and a trashy , giallo-inspired plot . de palma 's love of complex camera-work and luscious , blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of dennis franz , keith gordon ( a good director in his own right ) , nancy allen ( de palma 's wife at the time ) and michael caine make every scene special . let the virtuoso take you on a surreal , scary , erotically charged odyssey and you 'll enjoy every frame of `` dressed to kill '' .
the rookie is based on the true story of a 40+ year old school teacher in big lake , texas reaching the majors . jimmy morris ( dennis quaid ) is a small-town high school science teacher and baseball coach . his team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph . after throwing batting practice and a wager is made , jim agrees that if his team wins regional 's , he 'll try out for the major leagues . the movie tells the story from jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors . it is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie . dennis quaid makes the movie worth while , giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes : brian cox , rachel griffiths , and angus t. jones . the story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end . the baseball scenes are fun , well-filmed , and portrayed excellently . the movie really is n't about baseball but about one man 's quest to reach his dream . it 's inspiring , it 's emotional , and it 's funny . i liked it , i hope you do . the rookie . starring : dennis quaid , brian cox , rachel griffiths , and angus t. jones . 4 out of 5 stars .
when i learned of sir alec guinness ' death , this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing . what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years . and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame . his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears . both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites .
beautiful and touching movie . rich colors , great settings , good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while . i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china . my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch ... i highly recommend this movie . her performance , in my opinion , was academy award material ! the only real sad fact here is that universal has n't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format , whether it be tape or dvd . they are ignoring a very good movie . but universal has little regard for its library on dvd , which is sad . if you get the chance to see this somewhere ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable ) , see it ! i wo n't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film , and too many `` reviewers '' spend hours writing about the story , which is available anywhere . a 10 !
actually this movie has silly moments , both in the claymation part and in the joe pesci and children part , and it 's much worse than other mj movies like `` the wiz '' , `` captain eo '' and `` ghosts '' . but as a die hard michael jackson fan since almost eleven years , ( yeah , that 's half my life , you guys ! ) , i ca n't complain too much about it . just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me . but as a movie , it 's not good at all , and i 'm afraid , that it would get a much lower grade for me , if my darling mike had n't been the one starring in it . but since no one but mike is the moonwalker , it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me .
before tuscan sky , i saw diane lane 's tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie . campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults . each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost , which makes it so realistic . maybe you had to be a camper to really get it , but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet `` this is so camp ! '' from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends , to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it 's amp . once exciting activities now seem mundane . a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one-two dimensional roles and makes them believable . bill paxton , diane , elizabeth , mrs. brad paisley ( probably when he first fell for her ! ! ) the beautiful scenery , bright colors , comical music ( including variations of hello muddah ) and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend .
return to the 3th chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th chamber of shaolin , in which gordon liu played shan te , a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter . in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten . he imitates the original shan te , tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses . its a classic light hearted martial arts tale , with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang . the choreography is fantastic throughout , whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu 's performance , as are the others , particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander , more violent and sweeping shaw brothers films . but few have such a magical blend of slapstick , unique training and fighting , with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good . full of light hearted joy , its impossible not to give this the highest score .
i loved this excellent movie . farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart . she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger . after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own . then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again . not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace . i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land . they are too easy on these criminals . it 's time for more harsh punishments .
`` descent . '' yeah . boy ... i have n't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since bruno dumont 's , `` twentynine palms '' ( 2003 ) . ( by the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of `` female empowerment , '' `` the descent '' ( 2005 ) , directed by our splat pack friend , neil marshall , who also happens to be a major talent his own right . ) but getting back to this `` descent , '' the nc-17 rated ( uh-oh ) effort on which the lovely ms. dawson takes a producer 's credit ( congratulations ) and directed by talia lugacy ( strong chance that 's not a real name ) , as good as it is ( in moments ) , it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed . as a producer , you really have to tighten up that script . of course , in the premise alone , you have the promise of rising conflict , but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict . at times , this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and , well , i guess i 'll let the others who 've already commented here speak to the boringness of it , namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that is n't boring ? there 's also this catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like `` descent '' in which rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her `` fame-identity '' to get a script into production that would , under usual circumstances , not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film 's leading role . rosario dawson is gorgeous and , apparently , you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long , but , oh , wow-wee , how fast the time just slips away : rosy ai n't no undergraduate no more . that 's part of the confusion about the screenplay : `` is she a graduate student ? a ta ? no , graduate students do n't really have these type of qualms with football players , do they ? '' again , if you are rosario dawson , executive producer , that 's the one of many , many aspects to the professional film process you 'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career . and if you do n't have the answer to why you 're movie is n't convincing , let me tell you : there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious , well-qualified , undergraduate aged talents , pining to get involved in the business , who might have nailed that lead character down , all the while , looking just as darn good as you know who ; but unfortunately without ms. dawson -no honey , no money . i have to say , the camera department did an outstanding job , however , because this film is really well shot ( i.e . lit ) in all its dreary/dreamy darkness . the nightclub scenes look wonderful ; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time ... the shooting/framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch . `` descent '' is good not great . however , i have a feeling , thanks to netflix , this movie will find a life of its own . i hope this group continues making films . if you 're into experimental american film-making , cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs ( or male model drop-outs ) in their early twenties , or if you 're an undergraduate , just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your american university , `` rosario dawson 's descent '' might be your flavor of rockaroll .
freddy has gone from scary to funny , in this 6th installment in the nightmare series . it 's been 2 years , well actually 11 since this film takes place in 2001.and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one , john doe ( jacobb from part 5 , even doe the film gives on hint who he is ) , in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street.not only does freddy gets his wishes , but he also gets his daughter back to elm street.when she finds out what is happening , she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all.we also get to see some of freddy 's eerie backgrounds . rachel talalay , who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now.many people hate this film , but i liked it.it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his wisecrackes ... comdey and makes the series more funny than scary.so this film is really a comdey sore to speak.it is not the wrost in the series , part 2 still holds it .
i had no expectations ; i 'd never heard of jamie foxx ; all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it . i thought it was highly entertaining ; it was fun . the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest . to me , foxx is an original . david morse is terrific ( true , this is not his finest role ) . i thought the chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the film and were well done . i did n't expect a lot and i was happily surprised .
i think this movie had to be fun to make it , for us it was fun to watch it . the actors look like they have a fun time . my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors . not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make . i see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more , or more because we laugh together . if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them . the grander mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man . he make us laugh together the most . i would give this movie a high score if you ask me . i do n't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors , but the main boy is cute . the actor with the grand chest has to be not real . they does n't look to real .
i thought that this film was very enjoyable . i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child . therefore , i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it . it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering , there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring . if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so , then they were obviously going to be disappointed . this is simply an animated movie ; nothing more . if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained , you will not be disappointed . in closing , this is definitely not the best movie disney has made , but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received .
sure this was a remake of a 70 's film , but it had the suspense and action of a current film , say breakdown . he 's running , desperate to be with his hospitalized wife , the police are the least concern . the chases were very good , the part with him being cornered at a rest stop was well done , the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger . this is better than bullitt , a boring movie with what , a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ? vigo 's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law , few movies had the effects-night vision , cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie , guy has 76'caddy souped up , toys with guy he upset . the ending is great , you ca n't tell if he fakes his suicide or not , a very good did-he-make-it-or-not .
eytan fox did it again : move the viewer 's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess . the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel aviv . i was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle , the relationships , the heart-beating city , the mess , the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted , blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever . strongly recommend : it is a voyage for the heart and the mind , with an interesting perspective to the israelo-palestinian conflict . nota bene : there is central gay plot in the movie . if you do not think you are too gay-friendly , be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as `` just love '' . ( and do n't worry : the chick is hot too ! )
it 's highly stylized , but this movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences . yes , i 's mostly comedy , but there are some sad moments .
since i first saw anchors aweigh in 1945 , viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me . at age 15 , it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great mgm technicolor musicals . now i am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players . though sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his dorsey days , as a solo singer , this was his first major film appearance . as another viewer noted , this seems almost to be a warm-up for on the town . sinatra may have had to work hard at it , but his dance with kelly is credible , and he would do better in their next pairings . however , observing his physique , it 's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean . who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting , and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat . though gene kelly 's personality and dancing dominated this film , his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force , almost the iconic figure , for mgm musicals , where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of fred astaire . finally , it was strange to see the fresh-faced dean stockwell and remember that he would later play a `` thrill '' killer in compulsion , based on the leopold-loeb murder from the 1920s . an additional note : one reviewer praised the performance of betty garrett as sinatra 's love interest . she later played opposite him in on the town , but pamela britton was featured in this film .
this is an very good movie . this is one that i would rent over and over again . it is not like your normal superhero movie . this movie blends comedy , action and great special effects . it even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on the simpsons . william h. macy is the bomb .
i 'm gon na tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this . however , the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies . it 's definitely something that most people will not get , as is the nature of absurdism . the animation is horrible , but yes , that 's the point . the main character is foul mouthed , violent , and stupid . no redeeming qualities whatsoever . his wife shrieks and wails , apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills . most of these stories completely lack any kind of point . but again , that 's the point ; ) if non sequiters , foul language , and complete and utter randomness are your thing , you 're going to love this . it is really short , so i would probably rent instead of buying .
this was my first introduction to the world of bollywood and i 'm now hooked ! okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching us films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you wo n't be disappointed . the songs are superb , melodic and very catchy . the actors are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world . locations , colour are spellbinding . if you want something different and are looking to be uplifted , cheered up and stimulated i recommend you catch this movie .
i rented this some years ago , the video store had only vhs at the time . straight to video was hitting it 's strides ( you know , where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films ) .i did n't know what to expect other than what was printed . first thing i thought while watching was `` what the hells ' wrong with the sound ? `` -obviously there was no dialogue dubbing . words echoed , so i stopped munching on whatever i had to pay closer attention-mind you there 's no shakespeare here ! , just simple talk . the story is simple enough , boy meets girl etc .. what struck me as humorous and heartfelt was , the people in the movie did n't seem like caricatures written into the story , but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs ( uniforms included ) . all the while , you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after , then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor ( people hurting their privates , using vulgarities this could n't have hurt the marketing . there was something honest about it . i thought if they 'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better , which i 'm sure they considered daily , but , they went ahead and made it . this , i felt , was what independent film-making is all about.the word `` indy '' , is thrown around as if it 's a genre .. ha ! .. that 's funny !
i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world . i ca n't understand why some people say she 's not . boring .... ? ? ? maybe the one who said she 's boring is because he/she is boring . she 's a great actress and the movie was excellent . it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers . the direction was great . i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume , flowers , churches , problems , etc . when she goes to the sister 's shop is simply amazing . everything 's great . we have a very good actress , wonderful , for long time . alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect . i like him more than in his next movie la science des rêves . and eric lartigau did a very good work . ana
another downey must-see ! if you are an obsessed fan like me , you have got to see this movie ! he plays alex finch , a 22 year old yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier . alex is the re-incarnation of louie jeffries , a no-nonsense lawyer happily married to corrine ( cybil sheppard ) . louie is killed on their one-year anniversary when he is hit by a car . he demands to go back , only this time in the body of alex finch . enter robert downey jr. , a lot of confusion , and a lot of laughs . although this movie is 15-years old , it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re-incarnation . and if so , how often to you meet the same souls life after life . i do n't know the answer . but i do know that you need to see this movie . it is a riot , and downey looks so good in a tuxedo . this film makes you believe in love , and true love never dies . it just gets recycled .
when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at tiffany 's , you know something is going to go right . drew barrymore , patrick highsmith , leslie hope , and sally kellerman are excellent actors . the fbi agent was a terrible actor . the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier , those was just weird . drew barrymore is very hot . intimate strangers , where sally kellerman worked , was a great part . the weird gummy worm was just weird . nathan was a very handsome cat . but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr. gooding attacked him ? and the scene with dr. wallace ? what was he doing fumbling around in there ? and not every male has a female , as sally kellerman stated . and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of victor 's , that was weird .
eglimata ( = crimes ) is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disaster.one of the smartest greek series ever ! actors like ketty konstadinou and maria kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty ' laughing.every viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had . actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in greek audience 's heart.my personal favourites ( apart the first two i mentioned ) are vassilis haralambopoulos , athinodoros prousalis and stavros nikolaidis but so many amazing actors passed by some episodes from time to time . whoever around the world understands greek should find a way to watch this series , even though it 's been more than 5 years that it was on tv.in greece they keep repeating the series ( ant1 ) in every chance there is like summertime or early afternoon zones.we 'll never forget eglimata or any of the casting crew !
about a year ago i finally gave up on american television . i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office , extras , blackadder , and the league of gentlemen . it was then that i decided to switch to british television . among all the shows listed above , the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all , providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i 've seen yet . characters included are the most unhappily married couple , a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid ( probably for the best ) , a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people , and the worst veterinarian ever . this program is one of the best i 've seen .
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine , i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment , but surprise , surprise , i loved it . convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles , let alone take in the ridiculous explanation . these quibbles apart , however , the film is a dream . fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score . he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so . really enjoyable with lots of colour , plenty of sexiness , some gory kills and minimal police interference . super .
last november , i had a chance to see this film at the reno film festival . i have to say that it was a lot of fun . a few tech errors aside , it was a great experience . i loved the writing and acting , especially from the guy that played the lead role . there is a lot of heart in this movie , a lot of wit to . i got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done , and they seemed real nice . all in all the whole movie was just a positive experience , and one i 'd definitely recommend . the story was entertaining and cool , as a woman i 've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy , and i could really understand his problems because of it . the movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with . the friends in the movie are really well written to , they are realistic . i know people like these , i only wish imy friends and i could sound as cool as these people when we talk . the whole movie is just real cool , i wish there were more films out there like it . - jayden
great movie -i loved it . great editing and use of the soundtrack . captures the real feeling of indian life , yet we can all relate . a well chose cast with some great characters . the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them . the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural . you just ca n't help but to root for jess in this film ! the acting was really good , even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer .
enchanted april is a tone poem , an impressionist painting , a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words . it has been one of my 10 favorite films since it came out . i continue to wait , albeit less patiently , for the film to come out in dvd format . apparently , i am not alone . if parent company amazon 's listings are correct , there are many people who want this title in dvd format . many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script . many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries . the cast is spectacular , the cinematography and direction impeccable . the film is a definite keeper . many have already asked . please add our names to the list .
