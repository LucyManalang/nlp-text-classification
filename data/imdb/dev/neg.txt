a group of extremely unlikable a-holes are tormented by lame puppets that some elderly douche bag night-watchman has kept locked away in a film vault for twenty years for no reason whatsoever . many people know this film merely from mst3k 's spot-on ribbing of the flick . but i 've seen the actual movie and can safely say that yes it 's bad , really , really bad . from the one of the most awful 'fight ' scenes i 've ever witnessed to the stuffed toy 'aliens ' that suffer from a lack of motion ( i had a my pet monster that was scarier ) right up to the atrocious acting ( i had a my pet monster that was more charismatic ) however , that being said rick sloan 's `` vice academy '' films are somehow , and trust me i have no earthly idea how , much worse . that 's not to suggest that this film is anything but crap , because it is n't . just throwing it out there . eye candy : no nudity in the movie proper , but there 's 2 pairs of tits in the dvd introduction to the film my grade : d- retromedia dvd extras : introduction by jim wynorski ; stills gallery ; and trailer for this film
very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really did n't care who would fare the best ( or was that the purpose of the film , to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks ? ) no romance here , no comedy either . acting is very flat and a very predictable plot . what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies . man , ca n't you see that the more you quote , the less significant your own movie becomes ? try to be original yourself ! a small budget is no excuse at all , first-time director neither . crappy , crappy , crappy . no wonder it only cost me one buck ...
this movie had a imdb rating of 8.1 so i expected much more from it . it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous . but before the movie is half-way through , it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable . the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie , but we get to know them a little too well ; they become caricatures , not real people at all . this is the same story i 've seen hundreds of times , only told here with slightly different circumstances . the thing is , i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog were n't so stale ! the only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations , and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office . hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon .
i love westerns . i could watch them all day . `` the good , the bad , and the ugly '' is my all time favorite . i watched `` silverado '' for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt . however , this movie , shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched . the acting was terrible all around . they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing . the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl . the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length . this movie was n't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store . i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing . only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end . i turned it off half way through because it was so bad . to the director , please do a better job if you decide to make another . this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns .
a few days ago , i watched a documentary called the fifty worst movies of all time and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man . being a lover of schlocky films , i am making it a point to try to find some of the films from the documentary -- not just including the incredible melting man . in fact , melting man is the first `` bad film '' i have seen since then and i must say i am rather disappointed . while it truly is a bad film , it comes nowhere near close enough to make inclusion on this list . now before seeing the documentary , i have enjoyed `` bad films '' ever since i read the book `` the fifty worst movies of all time '' by harry medved . despite the same title , the book came out long , long before the documentary and the makers of the documentary never credited medved with the concept . from the medved book , i have seen about 35 of the 50 films but have come to an impasse -- the rest of the films just are n't available on vhs or dvd . so , i thought i 'd try the film by the same name . the reason i was most disappointed with the incredible melting man was that there were a few good elements to the film . first , the melting guy special effects were generally really cool and disgusting . it 's obvious that a professional ( the famous rich baker ) was involved in making this look realistic . however , i should also point out that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effects as well -- such as the floating plastic head and the way the monster ran around after his left arm was cut off -- you could see it `` cleverly hidden '' under his clothes ! as for the story , it 's just stupid . a group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of saturn without being crushed . then , they comment about how beautiful the sun is -- as we see closeups of it . this is odd since saturn is so far from it -- it should not look this way -- it should be a large speck . regardless , immediately the scene changes and we 're told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital . what happened between the last scene and this one ? yep , it 's anyone 's guess . well , soon after , the survivor escapes and engages in a murderous rampage as his entire body melts . now considering they have a psycho running about who looks like a melting popsicle , you 'd think the government would pull out all stops to find and stop him , right ? ! wrong . a general engages one lone doctor to find him ! ! no army , no police -- just some dopey doctor . even after bodies begin stacking up , at no point do the doctor or general do anything to organize a meaningful search or get backup . now , given the stupidity of the film , you also would n't be surprised to find the following : when the melting dude is running around near the doctor 's house , the doctor gives his wife a powerful sedative and leaves her in the house . when a cute old couple is driving late at night , they naturally stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed . when a lady sees melting dude , she barricades the door to protect herself . this would be smart if she did n't have the back door of the house next to her ! instead of just leaving the house and escaping , she just waits ! when a photographer and his model are taking snapshots , the guy grabs his assistant and yanks off her top . why ? well to give the audience a cheap thrill and make it a rated r flick . when the melting dude is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him , the doctor stops him -- even though by now the monster had killed about a half dozen people . so , as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot elements . it is a very bad film . but , given the occasionally good special effects , it just was n't a horrible film like i 'd hoped . sure , it 's good for a laugh , but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness and never should have been included on anyone 's worst film list .
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made . if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than do n't make the damn film . i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie . adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace . watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender . anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime . if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it , i 'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie .
when sam peckinpah 's superlative the wild bunch ( 1969 ) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence , it did so with a talented ( if whisky-marinated ) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth , but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah 's epic , and soldier blue definitely falls into that category . soldier blew , er , blue tells the story of foul-mouthed new yorker cresta lee ( candice bergen ) a blonde proto-hippie chick who 's been `` rescued '' from two years of `` captivity '' among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she 'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money . also on board the wagon she 's traveling in is a shipment of government gold , cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with , so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills , accompanied by honus gant ( peter strauss ) , the lone surviving cavalryman . calling gant by the snarky nickname `` soldier blue , '' cresta demonstrates that her years among the `` savages '' was time well spent , outstripping gant in survival skills , common sense , and sheer balls , and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements , a band of hostile kiowa , an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance , here giving one of his most ridiculous performances , and that 's saying something  and , in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies , each other . during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg , no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was n't filled with rattlesnakes , mountain lions , or who knows what , to say nothing of the cheyenne , who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment ( there i go , thinking in nyc real estate terms again ) . realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave , cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge wo n't spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant ; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village , and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what 's coming . what happens next is what gained the film its infamy ; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre , an orgy of rape , torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of `` keeping the country clean , '' and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets , unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect , i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes , then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight , so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts , which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered , their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . no joke , this scene would instantly garner an nc-17 rating if released today , to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted . i 'm all in favor of westerns that do n't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won , or stolen if truth be told , but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be ; one minute it 's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up ( well , duh ! ) , then it 's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho ( with no undies ) , but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere , all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film , but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film 's promotion and poster imagery . but by trying to be all things to all audiences , soldier blue ends up as an incoherent , preachy mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness , but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre , would n't it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece ? we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing `` the most savage film in history . '' if you , like me , were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its `` daring to tell it like it was , '' take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .
you get a gift . it is exquisitely wrapped . the box it is in is hand crafted out of the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail . that is then wrapped in gorgeous paper , handmade and hand-painted by the most talented of artists . the whole thing is wrapped in ribbons made from fine silk lace . it is a sight to behold . then you cut the ribbon , rip off the paper , open up the box , and find ... nothing . that 's toys . you either enjoy the packaging , or forget about it . the film is n't without its point and purpose : war is a not a good thing . well , is n't that original ! the moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to even point it out . and even that feeble insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war -- war toys in particular -- are clearly a bad thing , until they need an exciting climax and the film simulates a war using innocent toys . it 's like someone preaching a stern , condescending sermon , only to end by saying `` just kidding . '' but even as an empty box , the film fails close scrutiny . yes , it is a sight to behold with some remarkable , striking images . the sets are imaginative and the cinematography catches the colorful scenes with skill . but the images are cold and emotionally sterile . like the screenplay , the look of the film is joyless and at times aesthetically barren and surreal . it is a film that wants to praise toys as wonderful and special things , yet shows them to be creations of a world that is empty and cold . the film strives to be funny , in a morose sort of way , but the humor is forced and artificial . robin williams , as the beleaguered heir to a toy manufacturing empire , tosses in his ad-lib shtick , which only seems alien to the bizarre , coldly structured world he is inhabiting . indeed , the topical references and tasteless sexual innuendo that are scattered throughout are jarringly contradictory to the childlike fable the film is vaguely trying to be . for this film to work , or make sense , it needs to be set in its own universe , an oz far removed from kansas . every time the jokes jerk us back into reality , the toyland of the film increasingly becomes an obvious sham . it is said that this was director barry levinson 's pet project , one that he had been striving to get made for ten years . it is sadly obvious why he had trouble getting backing . like most pet projects that finally get made ( radioland murders , radio flyer & battlefield : earth being great examples ) it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker 's field of vision . perhaps levinson directed and redirected toys so often in his head that he no fresh vision for it when he finally got on the soundstage . he had already perfected it to death . many of the toys featured in the film are clumsy , mechanical , wind-up monstrosities . so is the film itself .
with these people faking so many shots , using old footage , and gassing animals to get them out , not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors , what 's to believe ? old film of countries is nice , but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films . i know , racism is ok in these old films , but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility . portrayed as fliers , they never flew their planes , martin johnson was an ex-vaudevillian , used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties , denying his wife 's apparent depression , using her as a cute prop , all this makes these films unbearable . they were by no means the first to travel to these lands , or the first to write about them . he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer , but that 's about it .
'the omen 4 : the awakening ' is a made-for-television sequel to the original 'the omen ' film . instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy , he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents , who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong . the film seems to struggle with any horror factor , and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening , and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan , even with all of the events that surround it . i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening , particularly when compared to the original .
what a terrible movie . rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too . do n't be fooled by the positive comments ; it was n't scary . it was n't funny . it was n't clever . it wo n't even hold your attention . i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest . the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times . after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained . the dialogue was terrible , must be a translation thing . another negative that stood out was the idiot americans . 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character , intelligence and judgment . now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 . the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter .
this is one of those movies which makes you think : would hulk `` the real american `` hogan have done the same ? frankly i do n't think so and he 'd have been right . i 'm italian , i can not go proud of my country for many reasons , but i would n't have rowed for another team ( the french , for example ) , simply because i 'm in love with juliette binoche . besides the protagonist does n't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman , so why rowing against yale . as far as acting is concerned , well , all the players act very poorly . and then , you know , i hated that `` dead poets society `` atmosphere . in fact that 's another movie i hate .
this movie is nothing like `` office space '' except in the premise . office space was hilarious . i would not recommend this movie to anyone , as i laughed not once during the entire film . mr. cornbluth 's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 jason alexanders in the same room . if you decide to see this movie , use a free rental or watch it at someone else 's house so you can leave if necessary .
i watched dvd 1 only . the program proper may have 10 minutes of good information ; otherwise it 's snotty putdowns of religious people . it 's as if director brian flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm , and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition . also , flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues , and they take over the movie . it never gets back on topic . religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings . arguments from such victimized people seem irrational , and therefore unconvincing . anti-religious people will want more data . we do n't need to be told that religious people are nutty , any more than american jews need to be told how annoying christmas music gets by mid-december . in the best scene , the superintendent of fleming 's childhood christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations . that seems like the most honest part of the movie , and it was too short . if fleming were a bit more self-aware , he might have a good story in him about his own ( past & current ) relationship to christianity , and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth . and perhaps he could lend his `` christ never walked the earth '' material to a more serious documentarian . i 'm not studying the writings of saul/paul to find out how air-tight this all is , but a quick browse of wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited . the bonus interviews are pretty good , tho they do n't bolster fleming 's thesis much . sam harris is a good spokesperson for the anti-religious pov , and he does n't go light on those other , non-christian religions . harris also has some good ( and easily google 'd ) interviews on salon.com , amazon.com , and samharris.org .
seriously - avoid this movie at any cost . i just saw it in my first `` sneak preview '' ever and although i paid non-refundable money for it , i walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes . which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave . first time ever i walked out of a movie . and i lived through some pretty bad ones . it 's one of those films that is dubbed ( and badly so ) even though it is shown in its original language . it relies on the oldest , simplest and cheapest jokes in the book . on the military ( `` what do we do once we reach the fighting zone ? '' - `` you get out of the car and die '' ; actually , it 's much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film ) , on drugs ( a guy eats some `` space cookies '' , behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high - all badly written and acted ) , on women in the army ( `` why do we only get trumpets ? we were promised guns ! '' - `` that 's the way it is , that 's the way it 'll stay '' ) ... argh . okay , you might actually find these genuinely funny , but in that case you seriously scare me . additionally , i have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on european late night tv . so it had lame jokes ( delivered badly ) , beyond lower average acting , lacked pace , was badly dubbed and edited  it just did n't work . at least not on any level used as a measure for films . i would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee germans . and that 's saying something if you like stereotypes . ( which i do n't , it 's nice to play with them , though . just in case somebody thinks i 'm not being pc enough . ) instead of going to see this film , do something useful . try to teach crocheting to prawns , paint your toenails in a really irritating colour , disassemble your bicycle , change some light bulbs , try to understand einstein 's theories , convert to a different religion and back - in fact , go and listen to `` last christmas '' by wham ! on endless repeat . anything , but do n't watch this awful flick .
blonde and blonder was unfunny.basically , it was a rip-off girl version of dumb and dumber , but less funny , and they used too much background noises and music.way too much background noises and music if you ask me ! ! ! ! it starts out immensely boring , and totally inane.it does n't pick up pace anywhere soon , and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on.maybe , the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes.i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end , but that was the only part.also , i could n't help but like pamela anderson and denise richard 's characters a little.even though this movie did n't get any laughs from me , it kept my attention.i would n't say to completely avoid this movie , but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder .
a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent ( tom wood and arye gross ) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager ( ron perlman ) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city , the `` costume killer '' ( so named because , after injecting his victims with windex , he dresses them in silly costumes ) . they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers ( john considine , joe pantoliano , kristy swanson ) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder . there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows ( rumor is the studio wanted a `` lighter '' dark comedy ) . our loss ( and the actors , who all do fine jobs and deserve better ) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute . if you 're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance . his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions ( he was n't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode ) . he 's just simply fun to watch in this one . david dukes also shines in a two-scener ( but pivotal ) role .
i 'd give this a negative rating if i could . i went into this movie not expecting much , but i had an open mind . the whole thing is stupid ! the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . oh how original ; if i were a 12 year old boy i might laugh at that . i have no idea how this movie became so popular . seriously , the worst thing i 've ever seen . i was n't entertained , it was n't funny , i was n't even bored ! i was n't anything . it was n't even so bad it was good , it 's just bad . ridiculous actually . please do not waste your money on this movie . do n't even rent this movie . no clue how it 's getting such a high rating .
note to all directors : long is not necessarily good . this movie is incredibly long . however not good . the scenes were drawn out way , way , way , way , way too long . the sex scenes were unnecessary , and often too long . the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional , but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10 . it is way below average . some other problems also exist in this marathon . 1 ) ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree . the guy who played the great-grandfather looks nothing like him , but the grandfather , father and the son ( who gives us constant unneeded voice over ) are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality . no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last , even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn . this one is minor , but if the movie had n't been 3 weeks long it would n't have been so annoying . 2 ) the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous . some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed . the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave . 3 ) the love stories in this movie are totally wrong . you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short . suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married . then having children . then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships . this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie , but with time spent nothing was given to us . 4 ) the ending was just bad . i do n't want to spoil it for anyone , but you wo n't like it either ... unless you are sadistic . the director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis , i mean endless loop , oops they are the same thing . i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie , i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him . long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie . a short description of 'the horse whisperer ' , and sunshine . sunshine , perfect title . if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave .
hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres . in a bit of type-casting , jeffrey combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human/hammerhead shark creature . bizarrely , this being is in fact his son , who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer . or something . a group of associates are invited to the scientist 's private island . they end up being used as shark bait or shark mate . for some unknown reason the head of it has been brought along as part of this team . who knows why ? luckily , he turns out to be a resourceful , if somewhat overweight , ramboesque hero . i 'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support . a normal day for this it man presumably involves fixing someone 's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun-toting evil-doers . or perhaps a call to fix someone 's pc has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land-based human-shark hybrids ? anyway , he 's amazing and saves the day . he even get 's the girl . the shark-man is a slightly lame creation but ok , i guess , judging by the effects in general in this film . and the movie moves on at a decent pace . it 's complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land-based killer fish , then really you have no one to blame but yourself . as it is , there are guns , gore , girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter . it 's rubbish but not as bad as some might say .
may i start off by saying that casey affleck is a very talented actor and i respect his work very much . i wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent . with this said , soul survivors was a very , very bad movie . very bad . i would have to say that i lay almost all the blame on the poor script . affleck is a very talented actress , wes bentley had an outstanding performance in american beauty , melissa sagemiller did well , and eliza dushku is currently the it girl in hollywood . i do n't think any of the actors really got into the script , and i understand why . to say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement . it did have the twists and turns you would expect , but they just did n't lead anywhere ... except to more confusion . i just found the ending very anti-climatic , because it just did n't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that i had about the storyline . i wish i could give this movie a good review , but i ca n't . in all honesty , the only thing i think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it .
alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with deuce bigalow for worst movie of the year . i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb stipulates a word count and all that . i 'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie . a low budget dreck like red zone cuba , monster a go go and manos . or a huge budget disgrace like gigli , superbabies or this guff . you see movies like monster a go go and manos happen because the director has n't a clue . movies like this happen because the director is a stupid , money grabbing idiot who simply does n't care about his audience . it 's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll ( the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt ) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon . the really terribly bad horror film . everything about it is a mess . cheesy cgi , bad plot , insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack . alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody . woo hoo ! review over . give me a bud , roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again . do n't watch this film .
there are no reasons to watch this movie . should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life 's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill ( like that would ever happen ) then get this movie from the video shop ( if you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie . be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone ( in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing ) . oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure . but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - claudia udy showing her chest ! sadly no other reason than that !
very , very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise ( it did n't take me long to guess who it was ) in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas . stevens leads her girl gang of three , and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated . despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70 's , very average yet credible acting from most involved , and a plot line with potential , las vegas lady lays one big boring egg . it seems forever for the film to kick into gear , and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up . i was somewhat disappointed with this film . sure , i was n't expecting anything great , but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70 's or something like it . not even close . no one dies . there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo , one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter . the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall . there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument . beyond that nothing in terms of action . and as for the girls , do n't expect much there either . stella and her girls ( both very mediocre yet pretty talents , get in a sauna and a bath . what do we see ? nothing but a fleeting side profile . stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents , but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance . that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film . alas , it was not to be , and i have little to say in this film 's favor . it is n't a horrible film in any way , it just has nothing going for it either . yawn .
power rangers , the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s , has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created . what exactly is the point of this show anyway , other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children ? there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway . look at the costumes , which look like spandex gone bad . the mullet style hair , earrings , and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days . avoid this show at all costs !
this movie 's one of my favorites . it 's not really any good , but it 's great to laugh at . the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted ( eg , `` manji , can we ask you a few questions ? '' `` sure . '' `` we think you can help us with the answers . '' ) any fighting is more or less surrealistic . make sure to watch for brock , the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters . he only has two lines , but he 's one of the best guys in the movie !
first of all , i was expecting `` caged heat '' to be along the same lines as `` ilsa , the wicked warden '' . boy , was i wrong ! in no way is this film 70s exploitation , `` chix in chains '' , or `` women in prison '' . sure , the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison , who wear street clothes btw ( quite comical ) , but nothing happens . there are n't strong rivalries , no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape , and no inmates make out . there are 2 shower scenes , that i suspect is just recycled footage , but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter ! aside from the lack of plot , unconvincing , unsympathetic , and flat characters , a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to `` free '' their fellow inmates ? ? ! ! puh-lease , the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset ... as opposed to letting this mess continue ! i feel scammed .
pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to hollywood to make it big . was it his wife ? his girlfriend ? his would-be-girlfriend ? her father ? his butler ? the newspaper guy ? who knows ? and who cares ? the result of this is just a little underwhelming , and the actors here do n't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out . why snake venom as a weapon ? who knows ? who cares ? the music in this is alright , but there 's little of it , and most of it is pretty `` let 's get this over with '' this is n't worthy of your time . there are better all-black casted movies out there .
in this forgettable trifle , the 40-ish norma shearer plays a fluttery , girlish socialite in monte carlo , caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor . it would be tempting to blame this movie 's failure on the dull , talky script , or director george cukor , who never seems interested in livening up the film 's generally comatose state . mostly , though , it 's the fault of shearer herself , who desperately wanted to keep playing `` young '' parts as long as she could get away with it . inadvertently , this makes `` her cardboard lover '' a bizarre monument to an aging woman 's vanity .
summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what 's the hottest movie of the week , given 99.9 % of the screens dedicated to screening it . ok , so i may exaggerate on the percentage , but you get my drift . besides stuff from hollywood , bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters , and from some of the trailers shown , i 'm hyped to watch them too . tashan was billed as one of the most highly anticipated for 2008 , but i was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas . when i watched jodha akbar , it was a full house , but it was n't for tashan . after watching it , i knew why . it was entertaining , but it was fundamentally weak . just like it 's literal english title , which means `` style '' , tashan is all style , but little substance . not that it does n't have the usual star power , but scenes felt forced , and some bordered on a tad ridiculous , even for bollywood standards i must say . which is quite surprising given that tashan is directed and written by vijay krishna acharya , who wrote dhoom and dhoom 2 , both of which i enjoyed tremendously . in his rookie directorial outing with tashan , while you ca n't fault his direction , you 'd probably scratch your head over the plot , which was clunky at best . it tried to force too many things into the story , though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation , but that came a little too late , and only toward the finale , which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a thai action movie , with hong kong 's wirework and hollywood 's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil . and in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink , you have an assortment of vehicles appearing , and the one that took the cake , in a dhoom 2 homage , was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere . at best , tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy , and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters . saif ali khan plays jimmy cliff , a call center executive who gives english tuition , only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material . his playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with pooja singh ( kareena kapoor ) , who 's not exactly who she seems , the meek and sweet natured hottie . she engages jimmy 's services for her boss , mobster bhaiyyaji ( anil kapoor ) , who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken english and phrases must like how an ah-beng does it . and to complete the quartet , akshay kumar plays bachchan pandey , an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by bhaiyyaji to hunt down jimmy and pooja when they escape with money stolen from bahiyyaji 's business . so begins a road trip of sorts , with friends who turned enemies , and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on . jimmy cliff is probably the most implausible of all , because he goes from zero to hero , executing moves that would shame rambo , in absolutely no time , which is quite out of character . kareena kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men , and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes , and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee . every character has a backstory created , and i thought akshay kumar 's bachchan pandey was probably the best , the most touching and the most fun of the lot , even though his character seemed a lot like a non-green incredible hulk with his gravity-defying leaps and power packing punches . his wounds also heal automatically , which impressively puts wolverine to shame . and the best part is his theme song , which is damn alpha-male and played in ra-ra mode each time he takes on adversaries . but sad to say , that 's the only tune that is memorable , something that cheers `` bachchan- pandey-bachchan-pandey '' . for most bollywood movies i watch , i will usually be able to , despite the obvious language gaps , emerge from screenings humming a tune or two . i was n't able to do that after tashan , because the songs unfortunately just were n't catchy at all . usually the song/dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location . that i enjoy , versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain , or atop jagged rocks on the beach front . tashan probably did n't take itself too seriously , but coming from vijay krishna acharya 's story , you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous , and for continuity to be a little more careful as well . billed as a blockbuster , now i can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one . despite akshay kumr stealing the show , tashan could have been better on the whole .
what a huge pile of dung . shot-on-video ( really crappy camcorder , not digital ) pile of garbage . it is without a doubt , the stupidest thing ever made . the fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine . everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it . seriously . i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage . the positive reviews of this a $ $ crap were obviously made by the `` filmmaker '' ( and i use the term very loosely ) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life . trust me , stay the hell away from this video . you 'll thank me for it . avoid it like herpes .
this is the worst imaginable crap . the novel by h. rider haggard is very entertaining and dramatic . the makers of this worthless movie do n't follow it closely . well , old novels are n't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one 's own . if all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered-down clichés one should stick to the original . if they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard . but there 's no imagination at all only tiredness . this should be bought or watched only by collectors of victorian novels made into movies . just a hint , and not a spoiler i think , to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on tv or - god forbid - waste money on buying this . gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal !
i missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look , so when i saw it on the shelves in dvd i thought `` time to watch it '' . big mistake ! a long list of stars can not save this turkey , surely one of the worst movies ever . an incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented . perhaps it would have made more sense if i 'd read robbins ' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel , and with robbins assisting in the screenplay i doubt it , the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well . i hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately dvd blanks , take for example pat morita . even thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times . save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile , like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer . even when you see it in the `` under $ 5 '' throw-away bin at your local store , resist the urge !
arg . the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-awful third film . this time , european terrorists ( irish i 'd say ) hi-jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium . they pull into a shipyard , open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs . pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists , the cops and some marines . the whole film seems to be ( again ) largely inspired from alien ( as carnosaur 2 was ) with the pathetic marines going through the `` claustrophobic '' shipyard ? guns at the ready . this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot , with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine 's head off . the dinos are stiff , shuffling creatures as usual and the t-rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars ( it also appears to have no eyes ) . one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene : they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck . on opening it , surprise ! the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them . why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first ? how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside ? what was the point of filming this scene ? ? ? ? oh bother , who cares ? both thumbs down for the over-sized rubber iguanas .
i have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life . this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i do n't know how i sat through an hour of it . i must have been in a coma that night . i saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago . i could n't even remember the name , but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it . it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today . yech ! vomit ! barf !
when many people say it 's the `` worst movie i 've ever seen '' , they tend to say that about virtually any movie they did n't like . however , of the nearly 700 movies i can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that i walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry . this is my first movie review , by the way , and i registered with imdb just to rave at this movie 's badness . i went to see it when it was in the theaters ( myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there ) , and after 15 years i ca n't remember very many specifics , but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear . -- -spoiler alert -- - oh my , where to begin . fat loser left at altar , goes on ski weekend , meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him , takes him home to meet the family , they 're all cannibals and he 's the main course , pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape , kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother 's girlfriend , they live happily ever after . puke . firstly , the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be funny , and that this was a comedy . the special effects , what few there are , look like they were done 15 years earlier . the big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch ( he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn , that stand up tom and jerry style when they step on them ) . i 'm sure that there 's much , much more , but i have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher .
maybe i 'm missing something because i 've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews - and i just do n't get it . i like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak , look , and act like humphrey bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura . none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it . take the lead actor , lee j. cobb . his rumpled , rolled-out-of-bed look is about as far from the dashing , smooth-talking noir archetype as you 'll find . or , take jane wyatt as the femme fatale as another example . this is one of the worst cases of miscasting i 've seen in a while . she 's just not convincing in the role . as for the plot , it 's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre . i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes . and that final cat-and-mouse chase scene is plain old dull . ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it .
well , if it were n't for ethel waters and a 7-year-old sammy davis , jr. ( here billed without the jr. ) , rufus jones for president would be one of the worst representations of african-american stereotypes i 've seen from the early talkie era and would n't have been worth seeing because of that . ms . waters is excellent here singing `` am i blue ? '' and `` underneath our harlem moon '' while mr. davis shows us how his childhood experience in showbiz prepared him for his superstar status as an adult . he 's so good tap-dancing here that for awhile i thought he was a little person with decades of experience . so if you 're willing to ignore the negative connotations here , rufus jones for president should provide some good enjoyment . p.s . this marks the fourth time today i 've seen and heard the song , `` i 'll be glad when you 're dead you rascal you '' performed on film , this time by davis . must have been a very popular song about this time .
after 30 seconds , you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off . the story is taken from great movies like `` texas chainsaw massacre '' and `` hills have eyes '' . i like those kind of movies , even if they 're duplicated well ( wrong turn , timber falls , carver ) . but `` side sho '' is hard to watch : the actors are really bad , the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced . you do not care at all what happens to the characters . the so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical . so how about the blood and gore ? well there is some , although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly . 2 points , just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look , even for the gore-hounds ..
contains spoilers the movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences : three guys go hunting in the forest . two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation . the last guy can stand in the clear , shout and do anything without getting shot . he gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle . the villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains . that is the whole story , not summarized but in detail . everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell . we wait with him . long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping . we can take a nap with them . the one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming , if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing . there dialog is less then terminator and it is not because there is so much action . the characters just do n't talk . and , then they do n't even have something corny to say like ' i 'll be back . ' if my buddy shot this on the weekend , i 'd cheer for him , because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls . to pay money to rent this as a dvd is totally inappropriate . the one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling , how they local police did n't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun . if they 'd have filmed that , i 'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie .
the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film , most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film . it is extremely uneven , and includes many annoying elements . take for instance the switch between black & white , and color . if done right , this could of been fairly effective , but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience ; much of the film had an odd feel to it . the acting was n't extremely bad for a made for tv flick , but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times . many of the events were not coherent , and ending up being confusing . how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960 's ? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes ; because it was hollywoodized , everything had to turn out right in the end . i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time . i 'm glad i watched this in class , and not on my own time . i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan 's music . those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick . i hope you take my advice , and stay away from this .
this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s . when my friends & i were watching this film ( being the target audience it was aimed at ) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was . the rest of the time , everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other , leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film . it must have looked like a great idea on paper , but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on . crap acting , crap costumes . i ca n't get across how embarrasing this is to watch . save yourself an hour & a bit of your life .........
i ca n't say this is the worst movie ever made , but personally i think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters , ( 1 ) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it , and we actually stood in line to get tickets , and ( 2 ) it 's still the only `` serious '' film i recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through . once we reached the infamous ( and interminable ) snake fight scene , i think everyone gave up . the only positive i can concede is the lush location shooting . oh , and there 's also bo 's breasts , although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and does n't rate much more than a playboy pictorial . the `` dramatic tension '' in this film is between bo 's terrible acting and her husband 's horrible direction . the snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent `` action '' sequences ever filmed . however , this is one of those films that 's bad enough , it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor . definitely the worst film i ever paid to see .
i like billy crystal , and i thought it would be fun to watch this film , since i know he admired alan king and they would be funny together . i thought i had seen all billy 's movies but could n't remember this one , and now i know why . it 's so full of clichés and phony emotion ; you can smell each scene coming ( and going ! ) . billy does n't even get to be funny very often . he 's too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down . alan king himself is fairly likable , as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies . but what a coincidence that billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place , etc . etc . or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in la . and when the end comes , boy , does it come quickly ! almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene . mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor .
yes , i was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of michael bennett 's hit musical . it was an amazing experience and i paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985 . it is awful . almost everything fails . first off , attenborough ( a fine actor , a good director with the right material ) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when john huston was hired to mangle annie . the camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the casting ! ! ! they are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry , talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you could n't take your eyes off of them . but this cast just gets by dancing , does a `` nice '' job singing but none of them spark one bit . in fact , look up the cast on imdb - none of them really went on to do anything much . ( ok , ok , janet jones married gretzky - sheesh ) . so this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic , the desperation , the passion of the stage musical . a total strike-out ! ( but even though they try to smother the music - the great music still rises up at times and reminds people how great the score was ) .
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits . in this one , the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city . they did n't even manage the most basic of realistic details . so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie . you will not be thinking `` oh , i 've been there , '' you will be thinking `` how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby ? '' some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations . it detracts , but the acting was always competent . the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles , at least in the beginning . the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting . the plot is weak , ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies . the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance , they were framed and paced better . but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries . the white boy intro was pointless . i think the filmmakers did n't know what to do with it , so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really , folks , everyone knows it 's not `` groovy '' to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous . they threw away some good opportunities . educated and embittered on the west coast , a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york . they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . that would have been interesting ; this was not . the hunter 's point intro was the most disappointing . it was the most derivative of the three , and stylistically the most distant from san francisco . you 've seen it done before and you 've seen it done better . even the video game was better ! despite the generic non-locality and aimless script , these characters have potential , the actors have talent , and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction ... about ten minutes before the ending . good concept placed in the wrong hands . ps , there is a missing minority here , see if you can guess which one .
in its way , mister foe ( originally , and more appropriately , titled hallam foe  i ca n't see addressing its title character as `` mister '' ) , is a tribute to good acting . both jamie bell , as hallam , a physically attractive voyeur/creep , and sophia myles , as kate , his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance , are convincing . the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life . a young man who spies on the intimate details of people 's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp . and a woman in kate 's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police . these things are not , however , what happens in the movie . poor hallam 's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he 's been having an affair . hallam , of course , hates his stepmother and lets he know it . she has sex with him . kate 's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games . she looks like his birth mother . it all ends happily with hallam `` resolving '' his `` issues '' . forty some years ago , the play and brilliantly acted movie , who 's afraid of virginia woolf , had a similarly optimistic ending , with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart . the trouble is , it does n't always work that way , especially when nobody really cares . in virginia woolf , the ending 's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation . in mister foe , the emotional revelation never really happens .
a mix of ninja stuff mixed with a sub-james bond storyline . the result is incredibly awful and boring , being just the stage for endless gun battles . i ca n't believe this was released in theaters . terminate this movie .
based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of f. scott fitzgerald , gossip columnist sheila graham wrote this trashy story . gregory peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic ; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real scott fitzgerald . focusing on fitzgerald 's hollywood writing era , late in his life , the much-honored author was , in fact , living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when aa was not yet well known . fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife ( in a mental hospital ) and his daughter ( in college ) . living in a small apartment and driving a second hand chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie . virtually every 20th century-fox movie made during daryll f. zanuck 's leadership , as well as virtually every film directed by henry king , was a work of excellence . beloved infidel was the exception .
the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy , shaky , camera-work and the fast , confusing cutting . i am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies , but in this case there was way too much . it seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable . the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end . for a movie that pretends to be violent , ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it 's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development . that is another disappointing aspect of the movie . if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification , but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel washington 's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances . the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens . so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie . of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years , but i absolutely can not understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool . for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance .
just saw a pre-screening tonight . what can i say ? it lived up to it 's mediocre trailer run , though that 's saying nothing at all . it did absolutely nothing that any movie before it has n't done , and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually i got to the point where i stopped laughing only because i was laughing with the audience , and instead let the humorless movie play out . so let 's see ... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he 's not good enough for her , check . we have the three buddies that all have their own `` personality '' with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character 's best friend but is constantly rejected , another friend being the super awkward one that ca n't live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one-liners ( which in this case is just a bunch of movie references , specifically from disney ) , and the third guy whose name you wo n't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen ... check . we have the girl 's ex-boyfriend and her parents * * * * -block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up , not to mention the awkward family members from the main character 's side ... check . we have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed , check . we have the movie 's `` funny '' moments come from incessant swearing , people falling down or being hit , scenes from the trailer , and homosexual innuendos ... check . and dare i call it a spoiler , but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie ... check . honestly , this could have ... no , wait ... should have been a pg-13 movie . all that needed to be dropped were any f-bombs . honestly , it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor , would have gotten less media exposure , and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent r-rated comedies like superbad and knocked up . the humor in this movie is just so awkward that it does n't fit in with what general people look for . i bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera . let 's put it this way ... in the theater , it will help you laugh because it 's on the big screen and others are laughing . when this movie hits showtime and you 're checking it out at 2:00 pm on an off-day , you may be inclined to change the channel . the only thing that will keep you watching is alice eve 's hotness ( who is not quite a 10 , but still very good looking ) . aside from the main resolution , this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie , where everything else pretty much flies out the window . so there is a main resolution , but what comes of it ? it 's never really clear-cut , nor does it allow the ending to be `` feel-good '' with the abruptness . there was only one thing worth nothing in this movie , and that was the good soundtrack . aside from the nice choice of 90 's alternative rock songs , there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie ( more so the beginning of it ) that reminds me of something david holmes would mix up/compose . i 'll give them props for a great choice of sound . one last thing , this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer , because the inadvertent yet proud pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that rock band promotion . i just figured a lot of rock band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it . but i say hold onto your money . if this was pg-13 and you were 15 years old on a friday night with a group of friends , i 'd say knock yourselves out . otherwise , definitely pass . it does n't try and compete with the r-rated movies of the past few years , and ideally it definitely is n't as good .
this movie had good intentions and a good story to work with . the director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull , boring filmstrip that made me feel like i was back in mr. hartford 's 8th grade social studies class -- way back in 67 . what a waste , will somebody please take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it . every time a scene had potential , all we were left with were a few clichés , combined with black and white footage that they probably got from the history channel to show the action . shameful . ossie davis was the only bright light in this dull fest . the other acting was incredibly dull - it fit in with the movie well and whomever played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery . however , if you are willing to accept all the numerous flaws in this movie and are n't concerned with being awed or entertained , but want to learn about the uss mason , it is worth a watch .
the original was a good movie . i bought it on tape and have watched it several times . and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly was n't expecting such a bomb . the romance was flat , the sight gags old , the spoken humor just was n't . this may not have been the worst movie i 've ever seen but it comes close .
is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor ? the answer is yes ; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture . the premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work . was this considered a good ' b ' in 1942 ? hard to imagine . the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast , which contains several well-known faces from the '30 's and '40 's , such as warren hymer , vince barnett and robert armstrong ( i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in `` lives of a bengal lancer '' , so i was n't counting him ) . ca n't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice , get a root canal .
ladies and gentlemen , please do n't get fooled by `` a stanley kubrick '' film tag.this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.in shining , there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive , foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley . the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost , lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.there is not much to be said of a bald , colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.it can not be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes .
as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright -- and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed . well , i do n't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film , but a few may have died of boredom . the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look good . very loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story , skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances . once installed in his home , she is tormented by a half-wit gardener , a badly executed portrait , peacocks , and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot . and to her credit , actress peggy webber screams rather well . unfortunately , her ability to do so is the high point of the film . the plot is pretty transparent , to say the least , and while the cast is actually okay , the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you 'll be ready to run screaming yourself . true , the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes , but it all feels a lot longer . add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are . there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch . it is true that the screaming skull has a few howlers -- but the film drags so much i could n't work up more than an occasional giggle , and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui . if it were n't for peggy webber 's way with a scream , this would be the surefire cure for insomnia . give it a miss . gft , amazon reviewer
the movie was to be shown here in bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater , it failed miserably . apparently the story writer just do n't hold water . something was definitely missing . in my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past . accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment . the movie just lack any substance . the only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story . and a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time , such as the meaning of sacrifice , nationalism , etc . it is called the central theme . the movie fails to answer , why would i watch it anyway ? at least some strange legendary flying elephants , psychic king , or the eccentric king such as `` the king and i '' would have been lovely , something would have added greatly to the movies ' appeal . i guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie . once you got the appeal , then the story is the next thing we concentrate on . in marketing terms , we call it `` must see '' . upon hearing the title of the movie people would say , oh , i must see it . now where 's the appeal in kingmaker ? why not just redo the title and call it , `` how not to be a king ? '' and make a black comedy of the old siamese days , to the style of `` dr. strangelove '' . that would have been much more interesting . narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the king from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny . most movies today have that `` must see '' appeal , such as spiderman , men x , these titles speak for themselves . if they do n't have familiar characters , some other movies such as , the island , had an appeal itself when the advertising asks `` do you still believe there is an island ? '' . or for the movie , retitled `` how not to be a king '' might ask the question , `` so do you still want to be a king ? '' parhat
who likes awful `` comedy '' shows like little mosque on the prairie ? the only two kinds of people i can think of who watch this are : one , muslims and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about muslims that it does n't even matter if the show is good or funny at all ( which it is not ) . two , old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable , badly written , stale jokes . cbc needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is . if they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen , their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left . i 'd be curious who even writes for this show ? do you think it 's actually muslims , or hip , funny young people ? no , i bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad cbc shows since the 1960 's . when you look at the cbc comedy shows there are , air farce was only finally just taken off the air ( thank goodness ! ) but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and rick mercer that we are paying for , not to mention this poor excuse for `` comedy '' little mosque on the prairie . it is supposed to be offencive and funny ? only the cbc would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny . shame on the cbc for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .
the subject this latest adman-turned-movieman tries to tackle in his debut ( ad ) venture is quite an age-old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance ( pun intended ) . however , the exploration ( and exploitation for desi auds ) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to 'pepper , spice and sugar ' up the usual masala mix of b/g score , dialog , dance , drama , etc creates a nice-looking package with not much inside . in the first 40 minutes of the movie , the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8-9 times . further repeats follow thru-out the movie ( after all the lead character 's a cook ) . but therein lies les problemos -- no story ! hah , no wonder . someone forgot to write a script . amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada ( more ) amount of over-acting . really when is this guy ever gon na stop ? ? how many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something ? ? ? timeless mind yes , but surely what about the not-so-ageless bod ? and sole ? sorry , soul ? ! reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film . the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new-fangled discovery of a hot new idea . nowhere are we presented with any real-life problems or issues such a pair might face , other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle . the sub-plot of a little kid with cancer ( the bachelor boy 's first love ) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl 's character . anyway , nice try but not quite there yet .
pere is an idiot , but he is aware about it and acts in consequence . his life is totally boring and he does n't know how to change it . when his last friend , nicco , dies . he feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk . when he is returning home , he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements . although she ignores him , he fells in love and starts to follow her , obsessively . well the beginning of the film is a bit slow , and can result boring for most people . however , as action begins , it is a little better ( not much ! , maybe , the best part is the 5 minutes of sex ( almost 30 different scenes about it ) that you can see in the middle of the movie ; it is not good for the erothism , but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene . probably it is the best of the film . neither the actors nor the directing is good , and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people ( not for me ) . all the film is based on absurd situations ( idiot , as the film says ) , that have anything interesting . i like ventura pons , but i have to admit that this is not one of his best films ( maybe his worst ! ) , he knows to do it better .
i saw this film on the history channel today ( in 2006 ) . first of all , i realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama . but , one might hope that at least the critical `` facts '' that the story turns on might be based on actual events . reagan was shot and the other characters were real people . the movie got that right . from there on , reliance on facts rapidly decays . i had never heard of this movie before seeing it . having been a tv reporter at the time of these events , i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary haig as portrayed by richard dreyfuss . the whole nation had heard the `` i am in control ... '' , etc. , but dreufuss ' haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally . having watched the film , i began researching the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to reenact . incredibly , many the the principal `` facts '' of the film meant to show a white house , secret service etc . in total chaos -- and the nation 's leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war -- are demonstrably incorrect . they did n't happen ! there is internal conflict , to be sure . haig makes missteps , his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is `` difficult '' . but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film . there are too many gross errors to list , but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish . enlighten ? inform ? entertain ? i believe they failed on all three fronts . it is difficult to ascribe motives to others , but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention . and , as for my beloved history channel 's `` reel to real '' follow-on documentary , there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting . so , the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network .
how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory ? st : hf will be glad to show you . if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show , do not watch this . the writing is hodge-podge , the actors ' portrayals of their characters weak , and most of all , the design work is downright doggy . like watching strong captains , do n't look here ! like the strong federation attitude ? forget about it here ! starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hair . while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show 's credits , ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer . it just degrades from there . no , not even uniforms match , for goodness sake . they are too small or too big , collars down to their chests , and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and ds9 uniforms . the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads ! the only good thing about this show is its graphics , which seem to improve a bit with each season . ok , i take that back . who uses cg that inexpertly ? the designers of this show . do n't bother with it , it will offend your star trek sense , as it did mine . not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe . i wept openly when i watched this , probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured . that bad .
we have all been asking ourselves `` why do n't they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already , that way they can only make it better ? '' well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse . its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens ( hence no violence etc ) , the knife in this slasher flick is blunt.the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window.the cast who include britney snow ( who was superb in hairspray ) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared.more annoying is how the death scenes are handled ( we will hear the attack but wont see it ) . it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered ( im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids ) yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office ! ! ! slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original.i 've seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes
a battleship is sinking ... its survivors , hanging onto a nearby liferaft , sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks . even though noel coward 's name is the only one that you notice during the credits , everything that 's cinematic in it is because of lean . and on technical terms , its very good . david lean just knew films from the get-go . there are many moments where coward 's studied dialogue takes a second seat and lean 's visual sense takes centre stage . try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end , and that whole scene ; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing , the scene where we 're inside a house that gets bombed . noel coward is one of the worst actors i 've ever seen . he 's totally wooden , not displaying emotion , character or humanity . you can see it in his eyes that he 's not really listening to what the other performer is saying , he 's just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line . 7/10 . its episodic , a bit repetitive , and the flashbacks overwhelm the story : there 's no central story that they advance , just give general insights into the characters . still , its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean . its not a very deep or penetrating film , and its definitely a propaganda film , but its also a showcase for lean 's editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together .
as far as i can understand , tiw watcher is the first work of a young director . my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student , since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final credits . nevertheless , director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema . what is a movie ? how to tell a story ? it does n't matter , for the novice director . one of the first things you learn in school when you 're studying cinema is how to tell a story . you learn that , just like in novels , in movies you should also construct your story in three acts : the introduction , the development and the conclusion . you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax . you learn this is valid for a 3-hour-epic , for the regular movie , for a short film and even , believe it or not , for a 30-second commercial . you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that , ultimately , you can even deconstruct it . in rough terms , tim watcher introduces us its main character and then , the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunet 's amélie . there are no second or third acts in tim watcher . this is not a parody or an art film , thus you ca n't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure . you are expecting to be told a story , and it does n't happen . worst than that , tim watcher defines itself as a warning ; and one with no real purpose . it does n't make a point , or at least , not a valid one . its point is childish , with a sense of vengeance . the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaean . i was expecting a lot more from this short . the movie opens with a rather good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film . i do n't know the budget for this movie , but judging for the thanks-list in the end credits , merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where 's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers . tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style , color and carefully chosen plans , combined with a fine score . that 's all . there 's nothing else . there 's no plot . and that 's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values . hardly , you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story . as absurd as the comparison may sound , i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over-the-top stylish cinematography .
this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun ( which was supposed to be ) . case in point : 1 . in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the ywca . after her `` death '' the ywca calls her husband at work to give their condolences . hello how did they get his work number ? 2 . before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet . days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the john . does this mean the toilet was never flushed ? 3 . no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home ( since she did it behind her rich husbands back ) . 4 . towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house . instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly .
i had very low expectations for this alleged `` re-imagining '' of the original -- and they were n't even met ! what were they thinking ? ( answer : they were n't . ) please do n't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest . clip your nails , balance your checkbook , do anything besides watch this . remember : if you rent stuff like this , it will only ensure they make more .
the tooth fairy is set in a small town somewhere in northern california where peter campbell ( lochlyn munro ) has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn , he is joined by his girlfriend darcy wagner ( chandra west ) & her young 12 year old daughter pamela ( nicole munoz ) who arrive to help for the weekend . while exploring the property pamela meets another young girl named emma ( jianna ballard ) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home , she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the tooth fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them . pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out , it 's not long before the evil ghost of the tooth fairy has her eyes on pamela 's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across ... directed by chuck bowman i thought the tooth fairy was just another poor straight-to-video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other 's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable tv schedules , basically it 's not very good . the script by producer stephen j. cannell , corey strode & cookie rae brown is a complete snooze-fest for the first 40 odd minutes , nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone . it introduces the character 's , sets the tooth fairy legend up & that 's it . the second half of the film improves slightly but even then it 's hardly spectacular stuff , there are a few decent set-piece gore scenes but apart from that it 's all very predictable & forgettable stuff . the character 's are n't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off , the story has inconsistencies like the story of the tooth fairy herself , it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth ? what happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 ? why has she come back as a ghost ? despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people , there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment . director bowman does ok , it 's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about . there 's nothing i would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & do n't take any notice of the comparisons between this & darkness falls ( 2003 ) as besides the teeth thing they 're quite different . the gore is ok , someone is shoved into a wood-chipping machine , there 's a decapitation , someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out . with a supposed budget of about $ 1,500,000 the tooth fairy is generally well made but there 's nothing special on show here . the acting is n't anything great but it 's not too bad & unusually i did n't find the child actors that annoying so that 's something i suppose . the tooth fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight-to-video horror fare that seems everywhere these days , if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it 's pretty poor & forgettable stuff .
due to budget cuts , ethel janowski ( again played by priscilla alden ) is released from a mental institution ( even though she killed six people ) and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house . once there , she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food . holy moly ! does this movie suck ! you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film , apparently filmed off a tv screen . nick millard ( under his pseudonym nick phillips ) decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend . let 's just say that millard 's unique style does n't translate well to video . seriously , i have made home movies with more production value than this . and millard tries to pull a silent night , deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film ( which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy ) . alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage . i mean , at least the first film tried . here we have no music , weaker effects ( if that is at all possible ) , shaky camera work , horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up . avoid this at all costs !
to die for ( 1989 ) was just another d.t.v . feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties . the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in . other than that there 's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film . a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of l.a. looking for it . will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century ? this movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed . they 're so bad they make this one look like a classic . i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting . not recommended by me because i did n't like it . 'nuff said ?
this is a great movie . i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie . one of the best things in the movie is that helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to arnold ! ! ! that was great . i loved it it was pretty funny too . it 's a great movie ! doy ! ! !
i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that . the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions ( deliberate and otherwise ) effect the lives of the others . the film 's premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise . too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it . as a result , i never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally . by the end of the movie , i had a `` so what '' attitude about all of them . a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great , but as it stands it is merely so-so
this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over . poor directing , over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence . i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it 's not . i 'm not sure what makes the film worse . oliver stone does his worst directing ever . from scenes where woody harrelson 's face morphs for no reason or robert downey jr 's dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers , this movie is simply a mess .
spoiler : bunch of passive-aggressive people having family reunion . the script has them saying and doing things people would never do , at least anyone with a shred of decency . the hero falls for a woman he sees as his soul mate at a bookstore the day of the reunion , unaware she will show up as his brother 's girlfriend at the reunion . he tries to defer to his brother 's claim , but she , knowing our hero is clearly infatuated with her , teases him mercilessly by wearing sexy clothing and behaving like a stripper , rubbing all over the brother in a ruse excuse that she is showing him how to stretch . at one point , she actually disrobes and gets into a shower with him . he tries to cover his eyes . his heart is breaking . she thinks it 's funny , until she suddenly decides she does n't want the brother and leaves the reunion . the movie really drags . the audience coughed and fidgeted its way through the long haul . the writing is unintelligent and unbelievable . we almost walked out , but kept thinking surely something would happen that would perk things up , but nooooo . all the lovely reviews must have been written by paid shills , out to dupe poor suckers like me into seeing crap like this . comparing it to little miss sunshine ? ? ? jeez . shame on them , the writers , the actors , the producers , and the theaters for letting anything this bad make it to the screen !
filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they 're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves . this film is set in glasgow ( although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent ) . the premise , about people who 's lives are going nowhere , who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs , could have made for a really funny , insightful , quirky , cultish film . instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i 'm suprised it has n't been banned . x and y are friends . x is sleeping with z. y sleeps with z as well . oh you figure it out . a total waste of time . painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a gcse drama project . the female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it . if you 're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it `` a right laff '' . everyone else , run , do n't walk away from this sorry little misfit . and one question , when the group left the `` boring '' seaside town ( saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film ) , to go back to glasgow , why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england ?
`` scary movie 2 '' is a let down to the scary movie franchise . scary movie 1 , 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny . luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies . this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night . things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape . this movie is n't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things . it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i do n't think you will like it nearly as much .
tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite . there 's a bit of subtext that might be about france 's colonial past but it 's mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things ( like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park ) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers . sadly , that does n't happen here . it looks good and the acting is fine and there 's nothing really wrong with the concept but it 's just so smug . god , does this movie love itself . pity it is n't nearly as clever or as funny as it thinks it is . the only impetus in the show - sorry , movie - comes from danielle getting nastier and nastier , and the only surprise comes from watching the increasingly improbable ways she does this . that 's right : just like in a sitcom , which is what this is , with the added 'bonus ' of delusions of grandeur and a 110-minute running time .
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show . i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is . but he goes on watching it none the less . that is his right as an american i guess . but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode . it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really ca n't stand . i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college . my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed , but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors . and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along ( get the pun , ha , ha . like spielberg did . it 's like jesus before he became a man . or thats at least what i think that would feel like . any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this , even though it contains little of peter falk . i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet . this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbo 's investigation , as many later episodes would do .
there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through . i made it through battle field earth no problem . but this , this is one of the single worst films ever to be made . i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it . i do not blame her . i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume . i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it 's face . well it happens here . not to mention the sfx , look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end ! ! ! ! ! ! halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot . i never found one . save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life .
i would have left the movie halfway through if i had n't been with people who liked it . the movie is based on real incidents , but it 's so over the top it did n't feel real at all . i have some psychological background , hang out with a lot of psychotherapists , and have known seriously crazy people , so it 's not that i think people like this do n't exist . but in the film , the only characters who seemed consistently human were augusten 's father ( alec baldwin ) and the young augusten ( jack kaedin ) . ( although evan rachel wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of fun ) . there were a few amusing moments , but the overall tone of the movie was grim , bizarre , and nasty . what a waste of an outstanding cast ! as i watched them go through their turns , i just felt like i was watching an acting class . this was brought home during the credits , when a couple of people were shown just sitting there , not acting , not talking . those few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours .
the only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes . other than that this movie is a big dud . we have kim basinger , the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min . of the movie , which added nothing . then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve . they begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her . from there this movie gets worse , way worse . i know its only a movie and you 've got ta go with the flow but she 's got about a 5 min . headstart and she ca n't hide or find someone to help her . instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest . in typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her . but now she turns into one tough mofu . you get the point . do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type . it 's so illogical you 'll be questioning every scene . it is embarrassing for basinger and craig sheffer and the rest of the cast , as well as the consumers .
henry , a veterinarian ( paul rudd ) , and his bossy fiancé , kate ( eva longoria ) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception . it is the morning of their wedding and kate is in a frenzy , giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation . but , horror of horrors , the `` angel '' ice sculpture , ordered by kate , arrives without wings . in an ensuing fight with the sculptor , the heavy `` ice '' maiden falls on kate and sends her to the hereafter . now , one year later , henry 's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward . yet , the lovely medium , ashley ( lake bell ) becomes interested in henry herself , much to the chagrin of her catering partner ( jason biggs ) . more importantly , kate returns from the other side to create havoc for ashley , as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on henry . can anything be done to return kate into heaven for good ? this is an abysmal romantic comedy , one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen . no , its not the cast , as they try gamely to make things work . longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious . biggs , a funny thespian , too , is totally wasted . as for rudd , a very gifted performer ( see anchorman , knocked up , or clueless , please ) he tries hardest of all and , in truth , is the main reason to see this clunker . his charm , looks , and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable . but , nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner , absolutely nothing . so , if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy , think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one . even were free tickets to fall into your lap , be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh cinema .
i watched the movie , and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience . the language would put to shame the street loafers . the plot ; a father forcing none of his son to marry , seems far-fetched . the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded 's attention . ... and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh , and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look . hope it saves your time !
so , i 'm wondering while watching this film , did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock 's wardrobe by dragging out her `` before '' clothes from miss congeniality ? did ms. bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the `` before '' gracie hart ? as many reviewers have noted before , the film is very formulaic . add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest . the two bad boy serial killers have been done before ( and better ) in other films . as has the `` good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence '' character been seen before . in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes . one last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising . murdering one person - even if it 's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer . you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .
i am not so much like love sick as i image . finally the film express sexual relationship of alex , kik , sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness , frustration and jealous , at last , alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.ending up was sad . the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 08/10/06 , with us watched the movie together . after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate . on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere , i do n't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie . the love proceeding of alex and kiki , and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story . the two main reasons i do n't like this movie are , firstly , the film did n't told us how they started to fall in love ? sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living , then two girls are fall in love . it does n't make sense at all . how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man . too much fragments , you need to image and connect those stories by your mind . secondly , the whole film did n't have a scene of alex and kik 's sexual intercourse , that 's what i was waiting for . however , it still had some parts were deserved to recommend . the `` ear piercing `` part was kind of interesting . alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik 's love . that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love . also , the scene of they were lying in the soccer field , the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate .
well , what to say ... having seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was ? ? v.dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point ... i had to look away from the screen , i was feeling physically sick ... round and round and round .... you get the idea ... very very strange accents at many points .... `` those that should know , know '' unless your getting in for free , or being paid to watch it , or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something .. then forget it ...
this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful . ashmit plays the role of richard gere , emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane.they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses . even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful , though it could n't catch up with the original . it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers , where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show . emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer . in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors . though the film bombed at the box office , the actors got the undue recognition . in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film . all said , this is not a family film , so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family .
let me tell you something about this movie . i have seen it twice . the first time i was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me . i really liked it . i thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool . i saw it again a few days ago . it was horrible . really . i do n't know why i thought it was funny before but now ... i did n't laugh at all . there was nothing even slightly entertaining . it was just dumb . the story was weak . the acting was nothing special . there are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best . what is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist . really . do n't get me wrong , usually i do n't complain about racism in movies . however i have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'the shaolin temple ' or about the fact that the only black man in 'the street fighter ' is one of the bad guys or ... whatever , you get the point . there are people seeing racism everywhere . i wonder how would they react to a movie like 'the meteor man ' . why ? i will tell you why . there are no asians in this movie . there are no white people among the good guys . in fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys . all the good guys are african americans . do n't get me wrong , i do n't care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... what i do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie . this is the only movie like that that i have ever seen . it is just not realistic . if there is only one black man in a japanese movie which is the case with 'the street fighter ' there is no problem - in japan most of the people are asians . but if there is only one white man in an american movie there is some sort of problem - in usa most of the people are white . it is like filming a japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one asian as a bad guy . just not real . that is it . i am giving the movie the rate of 4/10 . it would be 1/10 if i had n't have fun with it as a kid .
i have never understood the appeal of this show . the acting is poor ( debra jo rupp being a notable exception ) , the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring , the dialogue is weak , the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode . furthermore the link between this show and the '70s ' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny , clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that . both `` happy days '' and `` the wonder years '' employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible , pathetic excuse for a show
if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic , it might ( i say might ) have been a hit . have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults ? well this is it . every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards . it would be hard to find another film , with this kind of production budget , that contains so little of any value whatsoever . the whole thing , from the opening scenes defies logic . dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical . ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself . what is really mind boggling , is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash . wow .
( various spoilers follow ) gene kelly . not georges guetary , who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un-french . not leslie caron , who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance . not even oscar levant , who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me . no , it would definitely be gene kelly . there 's something about his screen persona that 's too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in paris , content to put off facing the critics indefinitely , frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets . that 's what made him so effective in singin ' in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious , focused characters . jerry mulligan is in some ways a cousin to tommy albright in brigadoon , another lerner story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque european place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues . except that jerry is n't as likeable as even poor dazed tommy . that 's another galling thing about this film . jerry is sometimes a cad to milo , and even worse to lise . when he first sees the latter at a club , he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him . when she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number . when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him , which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace . and throughout all this it 's obvious she wants nothing to do with him . when she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop , it 's about as believable as milo 's interest in his paintings . sure he 's good-looking and playful , but why should that sway her when she 's got henri , who seems like a gentleman to boot ? admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress . if a role like lise was played by , say , judy garland , she would shower jerry with indignant insults and glares . if she was played by cyd charisse , one would admire his guts . but when she 's played by first-timer leslie caron she looks and acts like a shy , vulnerable teenager , and as a result jerry just seems like a creep . and why did they choose these other actors ( though personally i 'd rather they 'd solved things by changing the lead ) when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people ? not only is gene kelly a few years above guetary and foch , he 's old enough to be caron 's father . in short i think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic-relief type dancer as jerry , the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles ... e.g . ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl . maybe not them necessarily but someone like them . someone who could have chased lise and made it seem harmlessly playful ; someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that chaplinesque hole-in-the-wall ; someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with oscar levant 's sarcastic grumpiness . it probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous . and it might have provided a voice that could sing gershwin better . all this may give the impression that i do n't like gene kelly . i do like him . he was terrific in most of his films , just not this one ( well , and a few others ) . i do n't despise aaip itself , either ; it has good points , like the art direction . and leslie caron , who despite her inexperience is rather charming , and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting . georges guetary does a fine job and his `` stairway to paradise '' is my favorite number in the movie . nina foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody . but not jerry mulligan . i would n't wish that on her .
i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield . indeed , from me he gets `` no respect . '' i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it , and found exactly what i expected : a stupid story without any real humour . it 's full of lame , crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer 's ( dangerfield ) plans to build a ski resort in utah that just did n't capture my attention at all . in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast , including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner ( i did n't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this . ) this truly is a dangerfield disaster . 2/10
not one of keaton 's best efforts , this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the talmadges . a polish/english language barrier and a series of coincidences leads buster into a marriage with a large irish woman , who ( along with her father and brothers ) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune . mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off . this metro short does have at least two real laughs - buster 's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate . the other is a family photo , with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability . the yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags , but stops short ( for all the buildup ) of development . kino 's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano , drums and sound effects . not one of buster 's best efforts , but worth a few laughs .
okay .. this was n't the worst movie i 've ever seen , but i had heard lots of good things about it and i was sorely disappointed . i could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were n't a whole lot different from one another , that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting , etc , etc . ( well , that 's my presumption , anyway =^_^= ) at any rate .. the movie kind of bored me . i 've watched a lot of really long movies , but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on .. basically because i just could n't bring myself to care for any of the characters . i just kept thinking .. who cares ? ? ? i also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained . i understand that this was the 1800s and all , but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural . no one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events . the `` romance '' in the story did n't seem to be supported by anything other than `` i 'm a guy and you 're a girl '' , which i do n't consider much of a romance , and yet i felt i was being steered to the belief that these people were in love . oh well .. i guess it 's the whole `` all this horror around us , we have each other to cling to '' type thing , or whatever . i was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends ( who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl ) but that was just sort of dropped . maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle . i do n't know . oh well .. daniel holt was about the only character i really truly liked . and sue lee was all right . i did n't exactly dislike jake , but he seemed a bit too ... spineless , i guess . jack bull i did not care for at all . and i 'm pretty sure you 're * supposed * to hate just about everyone else , with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right . it was pretty graphic and had that whole `` the horrors of war '' thing down , but i 've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme , done better . ( i enjoyed the patriot a lot , for instance , even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative ) but , as i 've already stated , i 'm a cynic . what can i say ? : )
1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 ( dir-jon keeyes ) : over-the-top rehash of 70 's supposed horror flicks like friday the 13th ( versions 1 thru whatever ) . i ca n't think of much redeeming here except ( or can i think of anything ? ) the story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage ' to this , supposedly . but , lo and behold , one of the stupid people , have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered ( again , how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this ) . guess what ? the murderer is at it again and we 're tipped off from the very beginning who it is ( so there goes any mystery whatsoever ) . and besides all this , where are the 'cops ' and why does n't someone call them . i ca n't believe this movie was financed by someone and made . you would think that by now the american people would be judged a little higher , at least in their movie-going experience , but not so by this filmmaker .
the cat o'nine tails ( il gatto a nove code ) aspect ratio : 2.35:1 ( cromoscope ) sound format : mono ( 35mm and 70mm release prints ) a blind ex-journalist ( karl malden ) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter ( james franciscus ) to investigate a series of murders at the lab , unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer . rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage ( 1969 ) , dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner , toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton ( 1969 ) - and rising star franciscus ( the valley of gwangi ) . sadly , the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful ' than `` bird '' - is a disappointing follow-up , impeccably photographed and stylishly executed , but too plodding and aimless for general consumption . malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles , and cinematographer enrico menczer ( the dead are alive ) uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argento 's dark-hearted scenario unfolds , but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak ( the libertine ) as franciscus ' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding . highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station ( edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli ) , and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer 's devious machinations . but despite these flashes of brilliance , the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next , simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil . it 's no surprise that `` cat '' failed to emulate the runaway success of `` bird '' when released in 1971 . ( english version )
the version of this film i saw was titled 'horror rises from the tomb ' . the horror in question is a wicked medieval magician played by spanish horror legend paul naschy looking like he 's playing abanazer in a church hall panto . he rises from his tomb when a stupid descendant ( i think he 's a descendant , as he 's also played by naschy ) returns to his ancestral home and reunites the magician 's head and body , which had been separated by by the witchfinders who executed him , in an attempt to stop him , er , rising from the tomb . obviously , once head and body are back together all hell breaks loose and lots of people die . like all good magicians , abanazer here has a lovely assistant . this one 's played by another spanish horror great , the beautiful helga line . like practically every other woman in the film line periodically gets her kit off . there 's a lot of nudity in this film , and not just female - we even get to see naschy 's paunchy body , which is n't a pretty sight , i can tell you . most of the film 's sex angle is laughably gratuitous . there 's one particularly funny scene where naschy and line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to both have a grope of the nubile young blonde they 've possessed . it 's also pretty gory in places - notably a herschell gordon lewis-esquire moment where line plunges her hands into a man 's chest to remove his heart . the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end . they 're quickly scared off by a fire though , and do n't bother coming back . which is a shame . the scene where the zombies rise , however , is the film 's most ludicrously inept moment . it all happens in long shot , and we have n't really got a clue what 's happening until we see some figures shambling on from the distance . there are several rubbish moments like this , thanks largely to poor editing . when a labourer falls under the hypnotic spell of naschy 's head there 's a big close up of his face that seems to last forever and serves no purpose whatsoever . all in all , not a great horror film , but entertaining enough . of course , the version i saw was a dubbed american version that had probably been chopped to pieces . for all i know , the original spanish version could be a masterpiece ...
well , i 'll start by admitting i 'm not a john ford fan . ( i watched `` the informer '' only because i 'm trying to work my way through a list of the `` greats . '' ) so if you are , just move along , 'cause you 're not going to agree with me . what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is ! i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here ( it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution ) but , as usual , ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment . i suppose it 's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the `` talkies '' -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue . ( of course , title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times . ) what dialogue there is usually has a `` they 're always after me lucky charms ! '' quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent . of course , as bad as they are , the accents are helpful in reminding us we 're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over . ( it feels as if , with an eagle eye , you might see some villagers off to torch dr. frankenstein in the background . ) techniques change . tastes change . so i wo n't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day . but it 's not one of the classics that hold up -- - more just `` fair warning '' about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career .
yeah , well , i definitely had regrets about giving up my saturday night watching this strange little , yet very long , movie . apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life . here 's the epitome of the antihero in 'no regrets . ' we have this jerk , so messed up , so wandering , so selfish , aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman 's up-and-coming son , jaemin , unless it was just that : physical attraction . he claims otherwise , that it 's love . but after watching this , it 's like loving charles manson because you dig the beard . ( alright , he 's not that bad , but still no real redeemable characteristics . ) i could never get past the reason jaemin endless stalks sumin . it was never shown , just told , that jaemin loves sumin . perhaps it 's a culture thing that flew over my head : crazy/stalking = mad love over in seoul . it has to be , because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point i thought this was turning into a screwball comedy . i was waiting for a tiger named `` baby '' to make an appearance . okay , so sumin works two jobs while going to school , so far so good on someone trying to better themselves . but after his first taste of his stalker 's attraction , he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring . what ? ok , well , as previously mentioned , the obsession does n't stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup . basic movie , not 100 % terrible , but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies .
alright , i got passed the horrible acting . i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands were n't moving , i got passed the weaves , i got passed the colored contacts . this is what killed it for me : in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing . lisa-raye and monica calhoun stand up and , and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying , `` whoa , whoa , whoa , hold up . let 's chill out here for a hot second . '' i am a fan of the western movie genre , and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood 's movies . if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating , please tell me another movie that 's worse than gang of roses . i 'm through .
i have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of `` boom ! `` , and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory . so i voted `` 1 '' and hope you will too . together , we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross , and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing `` boom ! '' in its director 's cut extended version . the movie is one of my howling favorites you just look at the people involved , the director , the actors , the cameraman , and you say to yourself , `` yep , i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time . '' producers considering the dvd release of `` boom ! '' should note that , everywhere it 's been shown , there have been sellout crowds in the theaters . but it has n't been up to frostbite falls yet .
this is the first guinea pig film from japan and this is the sickest , in my opinion . a bunch of guys torture a girl for several days before finally killing her . and at this point , i will say that these films are not real ! they are faked horror films which try to be as realistic as possible . the scenes are sickening but also unrealistic in many cases . for example , when they kick the girl in the floor , we can clearly see how they kick and stump the floor near the girl ! and how stupid this looks ! the sound effects are also unrealistic and do n't make sense . other scenes include animal intestines thrown on the girl , the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours , the ripping off of fingernails , worms placed on the wounds in the girl 's body , the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific detail and stuff like that . very sick and mean spirited film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematically significant . this first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig , although it is not as bloody as the next part , flowers of flesh and blood , which tries to be as shocking as possible . guinea pig : devil 's experiment is perhaps the sickest thing i 've seen and the closest thing to snuff there is . this is still ( of course ) faked s ( n/t ) uff , the only difference to genuine `` snuff film '' is that no one dies or hurts for real in this film . i can not recommend this to anyone since thi s is so s * * * * y and repulsive . they who consider this is a great horror film understand nothing about cinema and the real meaning of it . i watched this as a curiosity ( as the other parts in the series ) and now i know how insignificant trash these are . they work only in shock level and that 's not too valuable cinematic achievement . devil 's experiment is perhaps the sickest film i 've seen and mermaid in a manhole ( guinea pig 4 ) is perhaps the most disgusting film i 've seen . so these are pretty extreme in my book , but that 's all they are .
to be completely honest , i have n't seen that many western films but i 've seen enough to know what a good one is.this by far the worst western on the planet today.first off there black people in the wild west ? come on ! who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly , no no , completely retarded ! secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.thirdly whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english ? if the setting is western , asia is n't where your going . finally , the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.now do n't get me wrong i 'm not racist or white either so do n't get ticked after reading this but this movie , this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen !
i 've always thought that most huge box-office flops usually have something to recommend them , but after the remake of around the world in 80 days and thunderbirds , i 'm beginning to doubt it . for those not familiar , it 's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets , spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters ( falling bridges , stricken planes , burning buildings , etc ) each week . well , the puppets are gone ( replaced by far more lifeless teenagers ) , and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from spy kids without any signs of imagination , wit or entertainment . young alan tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other traceys do because dad wo n't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams . grounded on a beautiful tropical island ( some punishment ! ) , his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by , er , running around the jungle , making a phone call , firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure . the good points are few and far between . one of them is that the film is mostly in focus . the other is they all got to go to the seychelles , which looks nice . the bad points : where to start ? ben kingsley 's career lowpoint performance ? the aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the children 's film foundation at its worst ? the almost complete lack of action or effects in a $ 70m sci-fi film ? the terrible script , the lifeless direction , the odious moralising ? but most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way . forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment , this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they 're making a kid 's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience , throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech . this film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents ' favourite punishment for kids . the biggest flop in british film history ( it did n't even cover the cost of prints and marketing ) , it 's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how not to make a summer movie .
* * spoilers * * khamosh is totally unrealistic , lacks a plot , and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves . the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho . this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah 's character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many ! * * * spoiler begins * * * at the end , the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah 's character to run up and shoot him ! * * * spoiler ends * * * it is a little humorous ( only a little ) in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim , `` oh sh-t ! '' overall , a baaaaaaaaaaad movie ! rating : * * out of * * * * * * * * * * ( 2 out of 10 )
just watched it , me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was . if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased . i actually gave up a night out to watch this , its all been done before . ie . hostel springs to mind , but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line , same old stuff , re-hatched , i read so much about this film , i even recommended it to my mates , my fault , someone said it was good ! no more gory , horror or reeling back in disgust than your average `` scary movie '' it has to be said , please do n't bother with this movie . get mary poppins . now thats scary ! i 'm off out now , go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this , little miss sunshine maybe
how did this ripoff of `` being there '' ever get to be so loved ? people say it 's proof that a decent , honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence . they 're wrong . the movie is proof that luck is everything : hope your friend invests all your money in apple and not atari ; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks ; hope that you do n't die of shock when you 're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back ; hope you do n't get aids from your wife . this movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs , do drugs , beat their girlfriends , or die young . in addition , the product placement in this film ( nike and dr. pepper ) is shameless . an emotionally manipulative film that is very , very empty .
i notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the mst3k airing . that 's fair enough ( that is , after all , how it got its widest exposure ) , but , having had the misfortune of seeing `` final justice '' in its original form , i 'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version . first off , it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the mst3k broadcast , owing primarily to an expository scene between rossano brazzi and venantino venantini ( i could use the characters ' names instead of the actors ' , but i just love typing the words `` venantino venantini '' ) , explaining why venantini 's fugitive character ca n't just leave malta right away . ( it 's not a very convincing plot point , but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it . ) whether this scene was cut just for time or because it did n't provide much fodder for riffs , i do n't know . another plot point missing in the original : the stripper 's betrayal of venantino venantini to joe don baker , seemingly unmotivated in the mst3k version , is explained by an earlier , extremely unpleasant scene in which venantini rapes her in the shower . while this does give her a motive for turning against him , the whole scenario is just really ... icky . ( there 's no other word for it . ) some of the mst-worthy moments ( the perpetual truncated shouts of `` son of a -- '' and the `` deja vu '' shooting of the sheriff ) were purely the result of the edited-for-tv print they worked with , and were absent from the original movie . one scene i wish had made it into the mst3k version : before entering the bar to question some people , joe don asks the maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside , because `` they see that uniform , they wo n't cooperate . '' however , joe don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit , complete with shiny badge ! i ca n't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him ... one final observation on the original , uncut version of `` final justice '' : why , oh why , did they feel the need to put venantino venantini 's naked butt up on the screen ?
robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members . however , the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a `` must see . '' i think the problem happens because there is n't a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel noon ( i had to spell it this way , because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to `` no one '' ) character . the movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes , or so it seems , noon begins his search for pete logande , the boy caller . this happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times . the conversations are n't too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you ... i 'm in the hospital ... why did you boyfriend move out ... etc . in the book , the kid almost becomes noon 's shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy , once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoax . in the movie , noon becomes obsessed with finding logande , but the audience is left to wonder why ? since there really is n't a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller , why bother ? who cares if the caller does n't exist ? i know there 's a difference between a book and a movie , but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen , because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie . since it does n't , the movie falls apart . this is surprising because of maupin 's other work , tales of the city . when it was made into a mini-series , it worked beautifully .
if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor , enough film for only one take of each shot , and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes , and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the french revolution , and also did n't have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds , and also the only actors i could find were the people who did n't make the auditions of that year 's soap opera , and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film , and also the zoom function on the camera did n't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and could n't stop , oh and if i hated my audience , then i might make something kind of like this awful , yet mistakenly hilarious , hell-worthy waste of time . the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas ' latest creations , which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie , there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel/space laser battle . i do n't mean to spoil the movie for those who have n't seen it , but that 's not how it ends . the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review . peace .
the movie 'gung ho ! ' : the story of carlson 's makin island raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of american people at the duration of second world war . it shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda . the value of this film is only collection and no artistic . in a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors . watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of robert mitchum who has a small role in the film . if you want to see a film for the second world war , they exist much better and objective . i rated it 4/10 .
the bloodsucker leads the dance - what a laughable title , it 's so utterly misleading . it 's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie . the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island . very little happens in this film . and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor , it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists . these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons . it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal . but the voice-artists can not be blamed for the script . it 's a travesty . unintentionally funny at best , pathetic at worst . the story in general is , to say the least , uneven . the women characters are particularly idiotic ; the men are either creepy or tedious . the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience . it does n't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders ( finally ) start happening , they all occur off screen . all we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots . a few people have said that this movie is a giallo . i can not agree less with this opinion . anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it . it 's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle . but it 's not very erotic either . i ca n't recommend this to anyone .
this film is very creepy indeed . unfortunately , not for the reasons the film makers would hope . there 's a mastermind serial killer too , but he 's not what 's creepy either . he 's just your standard comic book villain , a cross between hannibal lecter and freddie kruger , though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either . incidentally , for even the vilest and most reprehensible of criminals , can they be detained chained in a stress position , on their feet , arms outstretched 24 hours a day week in week out ? i suppose in the world that gave us abu ghraib and guantanamo bay , anything 's possible . no , what 's really creepy about this film is the central character , danny . this unappealing young man , aided and abetted it 's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality , wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman , and on the basis of nothing whatsoever ( her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent ) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her . seemingly within days , he has arrogated to himself the right to abduct her , believing ( completely falsely , as we discover ) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else , and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment , is sexually molesting her though she is ( again due to her sleepiness ) entirely unable to consent or resist . our suspicions as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed . he is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships , let alone sexual relationships , so instead falls back on this essentially infantilised woman , who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age corresponding to a lived experience of only a few years . the scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe-making , and the coyly knowing look she gives him when he gloatingly says he 'll have to clean her up again causes a particular shudder of horror . but again , i 'm afraid , not that shudder of horror the film makers were hoping for , but a much more straightforward spasm of revulsion . we can all see clearly what 's on the end of our forks here - it 's the paedophile 's perfect dream of innocence , sexual compliance and utter dependence . horrible , horrible , horrible . what else have we got in this mish mash ? twisted dreamscapes not quite as good as del toro . the compulsory `` you need to go to the police '' argument , where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it 's the only sensible course of action . the automaton sequence , much praised in the comments here , though completely and utterly pointless ( `` it serves no function ! `` , as sigourney weaver memorably protested in galaxy quest ) and looking to me just like the abominable doctor phibes rehashed in one of the saw derivatives . jeffrey combs does his best though , so a star for that , and a couple more because you have to keep lower rankings for films that are even worse than this , and in general this is well-shot and competently performed .
the only reason i did n't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film . it is a technically adept film . that having been said , this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven . most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program , rather than actual fact . and sibrel 's `` irrefutable proof '' that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics . i do not recommend watching this , but if you do , see it at google video for free . do n't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity .
i could n't believe it . i had to rub my eyes a few times . was it true ? yes , there were billy dee williams , jeff conaway , maxwell caulfield and tracy scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a cinemax-style skin flick set on board a spaceship ! sad as it is , `` alien intruder '' tries to be unique , with a computer virus/alien demon/harpy/whatever else you want to call her named ariel ( scoggins ) infiltrating this sort-of high-tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over-seen by their captain ( williams ) . interesting ? maybe , but here everything just plays out like a well-padded episode of `` red shoe diaries '' . williams out-classes everything right and left , and looks like he 'd rather be doing anything else , anywhere else . ah , the things people do for money .... the fx are pretty static , maybe even less than what you 'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this . unfortunately , even the female nudity is less than you 'd expect . sexual innuendo is the real star here and , of course , it gets all the best scenes . if you like a movie that 's all tease and no brains , check out `` alien intruder '' . of course , you 'll probably have to look no further than cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning . no stars , not even for what star power this flick can muster . leave this one lost in space .
actually , it was pretty funny ... in a `` god , how the hell did this movie get made '' kind of way . if you life making fun of movies ... which i kinda do ... go ahead and watch it ... but if you 're actually thinking `` is this a good movie ? '' eff off . this movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i 've ever seen in any movie .... usually they get five minutes into it before you realize `` this movie might suck '' .. but no , you know right off the bat . this movie talks about edgar allen poe ... never tried to explain it though , to people who have n't memorized poe 's life story ... so i do n't know if any of what was said is fact . this movie is about a writer `` ethan poe '' hookin up with his cousin `` ann '' .... they 're both descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they ? ! ? apparently , people give a what their ancestors did . this guy ethan poe is actually ethan `` usher '' , who is supposed to be descendants from the story `` the house of usher '' that was written by edgar allen poe . ann 's brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her ... ann 's also being stalked , at one point in the movie , by three different people on the same street ( seriously , three ... they 're like right behind her glaring at her and she does n't even realize ) . the characters that are being murdered throughout , show up at the end to try to save the day .... but they ca n't . at the end , ann shoots ethan while he 's trying to kill her best friend . of course , before she shoots him she has to scream out `` nevermore ! '' this movie should be seen nevermore !
this movie was a confusing piece of garbage . you never knew what was going on . the characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for gus ( played masterfully by george eads ) . i hate this movie but compared to others ( dark harvest , dracula 's curse ) it should have won an academy award . it was particularly sad to see a talented actor like george eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film . lifetime you have sunken to whole new low . someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again . also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary . for shame lifetime , for shame .
the first episode of this new show was on today , and it was horrible . not only did shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture , but it 's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it 's barely recognizable as a 'scooby-doo ' show . even back in the dark days when fred and velma were gone and scooby 's nephew scrappy was there , the team still solved mysteries . this new show instead features shaggy and scooby battling a james bond type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion . there 's not even a van called 'the mystery machine ' ( and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did not put my mind at ease ) . how can anyone take scooby doo and make this ? the show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole scooby doo gang , all of whom speak with the correct voices except shaggy , and even then i 'm being far too generous .
why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles ? `` an unexpected love '' - ooh , how provocative ! ! `` this much i know '' would have been better . the film is nothing special . real people do n't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed . the straight woman who `` turns '' lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character . if you wan na watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion , you might enjoy this . although it seems like it was written by someone who does n't really get out in the world to observe people . why am i wasting my time writing about it ?
yes , marie dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running . dresler is good . never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen . i watched this for polly moran , whom i 've seen elsewhere . here , moran is ok -- just ok -- as dressler 's shrewish friend/foe . too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion . the plot is good hearted . bad guys try to rob the townspeople . dressler triumphs and all ends well . i do wonder about the central plot mechanism : bonds . this came out during the depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly . i , however , not of that era , am vaguely familiar with them . they 're like stocks only different , right ? it seems odd to build a story about the little man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity .
i personally liked `` the prophecy '' of 1995 a lot . christopher walken was , as always , great , and even though the film was n't flawless , it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely . this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching , but mainly due to walken . walken is one of the greatest actors around , in my opinion , and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel , whom he plays for the second time here . once again , the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth . gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child , namely the child of the angel danyael ( russel wong ) and the human woman valerie ( jennifer beals ) . this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war ... as i said above , christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel . besides gabriel , however , `` the prophecy ii '' sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters . the character of valerie was annoying enough , and danayel annoyed me even more . the biggest pain in the ass , however was the character of izzy ( played by brittany murphy ) , a suicidal girl who would n't shut up . still , walken 's performance is n't the only redeeming quality of the film . the entire film is quite dreary , and well-shot in dark colors , which contributes a lot to the atmosphere . gabriel 's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive , and one of the coolest moments in any of the `` prophecy '' films . `` the prophecy ii '' is nevertheless the weakest of the three `` prophecy '' films with walken . definitely a christopher walken one-man-show , entertaining , but nothing beyond that .
oh my goodness . this was a real big mess that just could n't help itself . jeffrey ( jon heder ) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum ( diane keaton ) and not planning on going anywhere . until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert ( jeff daniels ) who she may be getting married to . it would have been an ok movie if heder did n't play his jeffrey so annoying , from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse . in the end , we are supposed to like him , but there was no reason to as he had n't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie . keaton does n't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007 's because i said so . not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton , and where supposed to believe that their mother and son ? the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they do n't look very interested either . apart from a few little smiles , this film really does n't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at ! if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort .
i vowed a long time ago to never , ever watch a movie that has anyone who ever was a regular cast member of `` saturday night live '' . i did n't rent `` corky romano '' but i was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour . then my good manners failed . stupid , not funny . tedious , not hilarious . bad , not good . that in a nutshell is all i can say for this video .
seven pounds : emotionally flat , illogical , morally disturbing the movie was distributed in italy as `` seven souls '' . i was curious about the original title and , after some research , i found out that it refers to shakespeare 's merchant of venice , where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio , who will have to give him a `` pound '' of his flesh , in case he is not able to repay his debt . whereas the italian translation makes ben 's plan something deeply human , characterized by human sympathy , the original one , though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone , makes it , just in its reference to the flesh , something cold , rational , deep-rooted in the physical side of man . unfortunately , i think that the real quality of ben 's plan is revealed by the original title : it ' a a cold machination , aimed at `` donating '' parts of his body , but lacking any authentic human empathy , at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie . the only exception is the love-story with the girl , which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident , to which ben yields , but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement . i really did n't like the idea at the core of the movie : the idea that a person , however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused , takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide : besides being improbable , it makes no sense . i would have liked , and i think it would have been more positive if , in the end , ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living , thus helping those same people , and maybe many more , just standing near them , and helping them through his presence . he would n't have saved their lives miraculously , of course : this would have probably caused more suffering , but i think it could have been more constructive from a human , and moral point of view . there are many illogical and disturbing things : the initial reference to god 's creation in seven days ( which , by the way , according to the bible , are six ! ) : what does it mean ? and what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad , who can have normal sex with a man who , feeling , as it should be , destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body , does n't seem to feel so much tried , both emotionally and physically , from his impaired condition ? the movie is saved by good acting , but all the rest is pure nonsense , not only from a logical point of view , but also from a human and emotional one .
anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined . we have the submissive , heroin-addicted , part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body , lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son . now , she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor , the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water . we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter ( she 's upset with him because he came too quickly ) and ends by murdering his female colleague , having sex with her corpse , and then chopping her up . we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom . you see , it 's all circular . deep , huh ? the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son 's tormentors . it 's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be . if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious , no wonder most people think artists are insane . we saw this lousy movie , then put on `` zero woman , the accused . '' oh my god , it was a tossup as to which one was worse . what is going on in japan these days ? sick , sick , sick .
not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller `` the sentinel '' . the sentinel was a big bore of a movie for me , not delivering the consistent action , a couple of critics promised on the back . to me it seemed like everyone was halfassing it , and only there to make some quick cash , because this felt very much like a made for tv film . the sentinel is a rehash of several better films , like `` in the line of fire '' this does not have any originality in it , and watching michael douglas run around , felt kinda silly in my opinion . the main problem besides it 's unoriginality , had to be the poor pace . i often got distracted while trying to view this movie , while looking how much run time was left , more then once . not only the miscasting with eva longoria , who could n't convince worth a lick . performances . michael douglas is usually a dependable actor , here is obviously going through the motions . he does not convince as a man on a run , or a secret agent . his chemistry with bassinger , was also off . i 'm a big fan of kiefer sutherland , but here he is only ok , nothing more then that . he tries to come across as a gruff , but managed to be more bland then anything else , and to be honest , he did n't seem that interested . eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre . she does not convince in her role , and was pure eye candy . kim basinger is pretty terrible as the 1st lady . she looks bored to tears , and her role is a throw away , more then anything else . martin donovan has a big part in the end , but not enough to matter for me . bottom line . the sentinel is yet , another political thriller , that bored me to tears . it 's too old , too tired , and most importantly the lack of effort sucked . not recommended . 4/10
god this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved , i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film , it is a waste of time . emraan can act but was really pathetic in this film , i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie , it was just really bad . celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever , she ca n't act at all , and there was no point of her being in this film , as for the other girl radha she was okay i guess but could have done better . what a waste of time . please buy the great music and do n't watch this movie .
ok , i have watched the original french version . but i ca n't imagine this being better with subtitles . all i have to say that this is the most boring movie i have seen in a long time . there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film . that 's why i ca n't understand all the positive reviews . it might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold . i usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie . tarkovsky 's solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example . but in this case , the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters . none of which i could identify with or care for . in a lot of the scenes i found myself thinking : `` when are they going to shut up '' ? the acting was pretty bad . not in an overacting obvious kind of way . but it seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes . this might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given . also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical . going from one scene to the next . it seems this movie was just written ( badly ) but never directed . this is one of the few films that i can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes . no suspense , no fear , no anticipation , no sorrow , no introspection , no intellectual stimulation , no interest what so ever . a perfect example of what i call an anti-movie .
`` a damsel in distress '' is definitely not one of fred astaire 's better musicals . but even astaire 's bad films always had some good moments . in `` damsel , '' astaire is jerry halliday , an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour . he meets lady alice marshmorton ( 19-year-old joan fontaine ) , a beautiful english heiress , who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers . jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt . he tries to rescue her from her family 's country manor house , but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry . keggs ( reginald gardiner ) the conniving butler , and albert ( harry watson ) , the bratty house boy , each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice 's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet . this musical has numerous problems . first , there is the plot , based on a novel by p.g . wodehouse ( who co-wrote the screenplay ) . the story is slow , painful , and nerve-grating . when fred is not dancing , we have to endure endless annoying scenes of ( a ) fred romancing joan fontaine or ( b ) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other . the butler and the house boy are especially irritating . they are one-dimensional stock villain characters , the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth . you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance . astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner , ginger rogers . joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film , and is miscast in a musical . she has little going for her , character-wise , other than her lovely face and beautiful smile . george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride , as jerry 's publicist and his ditzy secretary . the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot , and gracie has some funny lines , but she is also very annoying at times . the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done . at times , the cinematography is horrible and off-focus . there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets , to try to convince the audience that we are in london , not hollywood . ( they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie . ) on the plus side , the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific , and have become classic song standards . and of course , the dancing in the movie is exceptional , thanks to astaire and his choreographer , hermes pan . but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged . at times , the cast seems to start singing and dancing because , well , it 's time for them to start singing and dancing . the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot . ( at one point , the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason . ) the numbers include :  `` i 'm dancing and i ca n't be bothered now '' -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street . he does some great `` cane-twirling '' with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus . ( in the broadway musical , `` crazy for you , '' harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls . )  `` put me to the test '' -- fred , george , and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage . george and gracie match fred step for step , but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason .  `` stiff upper lip '' ( the fun house number ) -- at an amusement park fun house , fred , george , and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor , rotating barrel , and with the fun house mirrors . it 's the best number of the movie , but it gets a little repetitious at times .  `` things are looking up '' -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film , prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate . fortunately , it 's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer .  `` a foggy day in london town '' -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night , crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london . at times , he looks as if he 's not sure which way he 's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself .  `` nice work if you can get it '' -- a great song that is misused in the movie . during a social event at the manor house , fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song . each time fred joins in , the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave . ( again , harry groener did a better dance number with this song in `` crazy for you . '' )  `` drum dance number '' -- as fred and joan are eloping , fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums . as usual , it 's a great dance number . but there 's absolutely no need for it , except to prolong the movie . the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine . as he leaps from the balcony , he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that 's right , a * trapeze * -- hanging from a nearby tree . fred ( or rather , a stuntman in fred 's clothes ) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it . the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone , but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote . the > > ff button allows you to skip through the other , boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers .
you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers . i 'm sorry , but spielberg did n't deserve to win any oscar for this piece , and i think the academy was right in that vote . ( other oscars for best actor nominations and such ... that i do n't know about . but it would be hard to justify , given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product . ) the way spielberg directs this is so contrived , so meddlesome . while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me : `` sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered . sentimentality is sugary and unreal , a false view of life . '' this is over-the-top sentimentality . when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity , as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found ? there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film : all the men crowding around miss millie 's car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away ; harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he 's working on ( a cheap slapstick gag ) ; the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel , as if magically entranced by the choir 's singing ... on and on . nothing rings true . i even wondered if harpo 's name was chosen purposefully because it 's his wife sophia 's real name , `` oprah , '' backwards . spielberg is n't above such `` cuteness . '' it 's not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion . schindler 's list was amazing , deeply touching for me , and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism , even if the story is a bit contrived .
did anybody succeed in getting in this movie ? it 's a total mess to me : a vague historical/sentimental context instead of a plot , a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours ! shame on those who wasted money here .
original claymation rudolph : pretty good . original frosty cartoon : needs a little work , but could be worse . but frosty and rudolph together on the fourth of july ? c'mon ! give me a break ! ! ! this was one movie that should n't have been made . it was bad . it did n't really go for any holiday in particular , except july 4 . that made it especially bad since frosty and rudolph are usually associated with the christmas season . and any movie can be ruined by too much singing . the frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was . the movie tried mixing two familiar chirstmastime characters with an american traditional holiday ( which almost seems to `` limit '' it to america ) , too many pointless songs , and a lousy plotline . the result ? a bad movie that ca n't really be watched at any time of year . i would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like frosty and rudolph .
solid comedy entertainment , with musical interludes , it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications . boris karloff , bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy . the script contains all the standard mystery film props-sliding panels , secret passageways , thunder and lightning and poisoned blow-darts . karloff , lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era . kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940 's who were trying to forget about the horror 's of world war ii .
steven seagal , mr . personality himself , this time is the united states ' greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military ( .. who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base , later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station ) if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday , who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor . along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor , jannick ( mark bazeley ) , john sands ( seagal ) will fly into enemy territory , receiving help from his arab lover , jessica ( ciera payton ) and a freedom fighter , rojar ( alki david ) once they are on ground . jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders , stone ( vincenzo nicoli ) and his female enforcer , eliana ( katie jones ) , and sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter , but rescue him as well . and , maybe , sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained , rather ( steve toussaint ) in the process . sands has 72 hours until a general 's navy pilots bomb the entire area . on board the stealth , black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb , hoping to detonate it on the united states . seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he is n't slicing their throats with knives . the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead . the setting of afghanistan does n't hold up to scrutiny ( .. nor does how easily seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily ) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about . the movie is edited fast , the camera a bit too jerky . seagal is n't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes , unlike the good old days . one of seagal 's poorest efforts , and he 's as understated as ever ( .. not a compliment ) . even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film 's chief villains , tis a shame . he does n't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way ( .. sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around , but it 's not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups ) .
the oddly-named vera-ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice-skating : blonde , girlish , always delightful to watch , but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material . when i watch vera-ellen 's sexy apache dance with gene kelly in 'words and music ' , i ca n't help noticing that her blouse ( yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes ) seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag . for some reason , the very american vera-ellen starred in * two * musicals ( made several years apart ) set in edinburgh , a city not noted for its tap-dancers : 'let 's be happy ' and 'happy go lovely ' . in the latter , cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in edinburgh . there 's a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival , which is nonsense : the festival is not a showcase for splashy leg-shows . we also see a couple of stock shots of the royal mile : apart from a few highland accents , there 's absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie . the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning , when we learn that the title of romero 's show is 'frolics to you ' : this is a cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks wo n't . vera-ellen is , as usual , cute and appealing and an impressive dancer , but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad . the plot -- mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson -- is brainless , though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals . romero is less annoying than usual here , probably because ( for once ) he is n't required to convince us that he 's interested in bedding the heroine . the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes . the father of sally ann howes was a major star of west end stage musicals ; his wistful rendition of `` she 's my lovely '' was a big hit in britain in 1937 . here , he shows up in several scenes as romero 's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number , nor even any real comedy . it 's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word 'lovely ' , sure to evoke howes 's greatest hit -- would cast a major british musical star but give him nothing to do ! the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts ( whom i worked with once ) shines in one restaurant sequence , and there 's a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall . as vera-ellen 's confidante , somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices i 've ever heard : it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go , but does n't match either . val guest has a story credit , but this movie does n't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies . the colour photography is wretched , though i realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood 's process work . 'happy go lovely ' is at utmost best a pleasant time-waster , with 'waster ' being the operative word . i 'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 .
i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it . i sure did n't . it 's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars : music throughout the film in almost every single frame , almost no profanity , set in a time long gone , sepia-toned imagery , pretentious title , no sex , and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx/cgi so that we ( the stupid audience ) get it . one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong ! instead they call the nobel-price ( named after an actual person called alfred nobel ) 'the noble-price ' .. jesus ! how can one make such a mistake in such a big production , supposedly based on a true story . what a sham ! what were you and the others thinking ron ?
if you hit your teens in the 70s , as i did , you probably remember the stories about studio 54 whether or not you liked disco . an exclusive club , it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption ; there 's even an excellent vh1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday , and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film . sadly , this is n't it . 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees , a bartender named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a busboy named greg ( breckin meyer ) , his wife , a coat-check girl , anita ( selma hayek ) , and of course the master of ceremonies himself , steve rubell ( mike meyers ) . while the goings-on at the club are well represented , this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers , following shane 's story the closest . the movie works in spurts . sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture ( such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and does n't know who 'errol flynt ' is ) , and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama . some of that is inherent in the premise  following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie . while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night , the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on ; and rubell himself , while his excesses are mentioned , come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar , a cheat , a drug abuser , and promiscuous as all hell . not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here , but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate . a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd . meyers does his best to capture rubell , but he 's given so little to work with here it 's surprising his performance is effective ; but he 's good , and he helps to anchor the film . philippe , whom i find generally to be a good actor , is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character ; he 's limited to a deer-in-the-headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown , and even he ca n't translate that into a strong performance . hayek and meyer are both okay , again , undercut by the writing , and neve campbell  prominently featured on the dvd cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo . for some reason i still find myself interested , even fascinated , by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies . but even given that , this is not a film that particularly engaged me , despite a predisposition to like it . i 'd say if that era , or that club , has any interest for you , track down the vh1 special rather than this middle-of-the-road melodrama .
* * may contain spoilers * * the titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father ( an eccentric professor whose stock pith helmet is broken in one shot and whole in the next ) from a moth-eaten , dime-store mummy and nasty nazis out to -- what else ? -- build a fourth reich . misty 's costume , like those of some other wimmen , gets skimpier as the movie rolls on . the last portion of the movie is devoted to protracted lesbian action ; this footage actually gets real boring , real fast , which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curvaceous creatures in front of it . misty gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast , then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft-core sex . this makes mummy raider a throwback to movies made in the 1960s by guys like stan borden , david f. friedman and harry novak . just think : if this wonder-work had been cranked out four decades ago , it would have played for years on 42nd street along with wham bam thank you spaceman and kiss me quick . as it is , misty mundae mummy raider went straight to home video . grab yours , quick , before it goes out of print .
jack black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing , but in this movie ... besides the direction , writing , lack of plot , constant mugging ( aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots ) , and a .050 joke batting average , it was still an utter waste of time . the idea sounds promising , but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction i 've seen this side of you-tube . i kept hearing that this film portrayed mexicans very negatively . while that 's no doubt true , i really do n't think this movie is meant to be racist . i think that 's it 's more a result of a `` creative '' team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess . you can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera : `` hey look , it 's an ugly mexican ! laugh , people ! please , for the love of all things tenacious , laugh ! '' but put the racism charges aside . when you get down to it , it 's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended , imo .
wow ... i ca n't believe just how bad zombie doom ( aka violent sh ! t 3 ) really is . i 'd heard the rumors , read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself . well , let me tell ya - it blows ! ! ! the worst acting of any film ever made , dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted , inept and laughable gore fx , no discernible plot , `` cinematography '' that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder , weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on ... three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords . two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks , and are given a day 's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the `` tribe '' ... that 's pretty much it ... honestly - this is one of the worst films i 've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too . the budget had to be about $ 200 and was spent entirely on the gore fx ( which actually may not have been a bad idea ... ) . there is nothing to zombie doom other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of horribly dubbed dialog . this film makes other no-budget outings like premutos : lord of the living dead look like titanic . some may rank zd in the `` so-bad-it's-good '' category - and i guess if you 're really drunk or high and watching it with a few friends mst3k-style - i guess it could be looked at that way . but not by me . i hated pretty much everything about it . if zombie doom or zombie 90 ( which is equally appalling and is included as a `` bonus '' on the shock-o-rama release of zd ) is indicative of andreas schnaas ' other works - then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death . there is one amusing kung-fu battle in the latter half of the film , and a lot of blood - so i 'll grant this one a very generous 3/10 - do yourself a favor and skip this .
i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies , but my god ! ! ! this was the worst movie i have ever seen . bad acting , bad effects , bad script , bad everything ! the plot follows a group of teen cliche 's on their way to a rave ( that takes place in broad daylight ) at a remote island . however , when the group arrives , all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes . determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers , the clan set 's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest . during this crusade , they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids . they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors . basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the `` house of the dead . '' this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence , redundant clips from the hotd video game , and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations . one of the character 's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others . why ? not because he was noble and brave , but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled ! i 'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? ! ? to sum it all up , there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is . the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen , and i 'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily cover the costs it took to make it . grade : f
really bad movie . maybe the worst i 've ever seen . alien invasion , a la the blob , without the acting . meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue . bad plot , bad fake tongue . absurd comedy worth missing . wash your hair or take out the trash .
the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline ... otherwise , this movie was terrible . the acting was ridiculously bad , and the set design was cheesy and very tacky . the story was decent , but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting . i would n't recommend watching this one ... the only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... especially ryan bauer , the man who plays the soap opera star . some of the editing was well done , but there are continuity errors all over the place ... i 'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... can we get a good one soon ?
okay , so the introduction , with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film , is so lame it 's funny . and so the first `` skull scene '' is so drawn out and un-suspenseful it 's funny . the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent , there 's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters , and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go . the acting is average , not truly bad . altogether , this movie does n't quite fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would . it 's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest . if i just read the screenplay , i 'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie . it 's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie . so it 's a bad movie , but there are much worse ones out there .
i was so disappointed by this show . after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it , how it was a `` ground breaking show '' and all sorts of wild promises if quality , i tried to watch it . what a letdown ! ! the acting was way forced and exaggerated . the story made very little sense . as for any hint of the vaunted `` look into teenagers ' lives '' , i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show . some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show . the reason is that it 's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is .
was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie ? the character , leon , is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore . some movies can get away with the sexual jokes , and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on . some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie . scary movie was stupid , and american pie wouldnt have done well without the sexual jokes . the only role , besides leon , that had some humor that followed was will ferrell . the character really was dumb and that was all , the dumb humor was all that had me watching . the movie was ok , and nothing else . i dont really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show . the skits last about 5 minutes , and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit , then what is the world coming to ? molly shannon had superstar , cheri o'terri had scary movie , but she wasnt a leading role , and will had elf . but that was good , but he did some dumb movie , but i cant remember , and mike myers with wayne 's world . how come the mad tv crew dont ever get movie deals ? seen only one guy break through , but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick . but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue , funny or not . this movie is not good , but had some positive humor . what a waste of film and people 's money . ( d d- )
when i first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago , i loved it . i still think the directing and cinematography are excellent , as is the music . but it 's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more . i find emma thompson 's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book ; she has reduced marianne to a side-character , a second fiddle to her much too old , much too severe elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments ' , and often they appear to be there just to show off thompson herself . i do understand her cutting off several characters from the book , but leaving out the one scene where willoughby in the book is redeemed ? for someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie , those are the things always difficult to digest . as for the actors , i love kate winslet as marianne . she is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully , without too much sentimentality . alan rickman is great , a bit old perhaps , but he plays the role beautifully . and elizabeth spriggs , she is absolutely fantastic as always .
to sat how awful the shield is , you 'd have to write pages and pages , so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing . `` when directors go awry '' should have been the title of this production . indeed , directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward . how is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a `` style '' ? how is it propelling the story forward ? of course there 's also the `` editing by random numbers '' nonsense . apparently it 's become hip to just cut randomly . i guess it 's too much work to do good editing . well , that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time .
when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements , i thought the show would be entertaining to watch . the little robot guy does look kinda cute . the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows . before the show aired , i studied it through some sources . there , i did became slightly dismayed . the three children ( tommy , gus and lola ) are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception . it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad . one good example is robot jones , a robot character from `` whatever happened to robot jones ? '' the show is n't bad really . but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism . thus , i do n't watch it much .
any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply does n't bother with an actual story , it 's annoying . those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first , and the story simply tacked on . for this reason we often talk of the story `` jumping through hoops '' as it twists about , trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion . the story in `` comet over broadway '' does n't just jump through hoops , it 's a three ring circus . it 's so ludicrous , so ill-conceived , so disingenuous that , if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen , you will be carrying on quite a rant before it 's through . the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession . since it 's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion . so , in the end there 's no point to the story , the theme becomes irrelevant and , as is often the case with poor screenplays , the acting does n't save a thing .
the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands . but she is speaking german to him . the 2 languishes are completely different , its like saying `` well he takes french commands '' and start talking spanish . james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest . the role just does n't fit him , even if its mend to be a comedy . to many stereotype/predicable stuff . typical comment or comebacks . if you do n't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv . but i would n't suggesting renting it .
dull , predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance ( weller ) who goes on across the country just to find his ex-wife and children ; meanwhile , he kills everyone in his way only by a single touch of his hands . in his dangerous track , a doctor ( hurt ) and a young reporter ( natasha ) try to stop the man . the movie has a not original premise but even though could be much better . the final result is just a movie without suspense or gritting moments . even the good cast is completely waste . i give this a 4 ( four ) .
soulless milking of cash cow franchise . generic superhero flick . cgi showcase . gavin hood 's `` a series of improbable events . '' combinatoric iteration of mutant fight scenes strung together by inane exposition justifying formation/dissolution of arbitrary alliances . i 'm not expecting shakespeare here but the cliché per minute meter was off the charts : primal scream while looking skyward and kneeling over murdered girlfriend . renegade military commander . predictable double crosses . revenge sought for slain lover . erased memories . evil character discovering morality at last minute . misguided failures to execute nemeses after defeating them in melee . lover not really dead . lover actually acting as spy for hero 's arch-nemesis . girlfriend/spy actually falls for protagonist . good people work for antagonist in order to save kidnapped family members . evil mastermind fails to honor promises to reluctant employees . kindly old couple care for weary hero and get murdered for their troubles . certain deaths averted as third parties arrive on scene before coup de grace . hero reluctantly joining secret government agency . abandonment of elite squad in protest over slaughter of innocents . scientists unable to control indestructible killing machine of their own creation . outdated but lovable government 'secret weapon ' kills off better designed but heartless successor . hero strolls away from wreck and casually lights a trail of gasoline behind him . after everyone has given up , flatlined heart monitor picks up a pulse . evil mastermind explains plans to hero he no longer sees as a threat . hero refuses to kill defeated foe because he 's `` better than that '' . transparent comic relief character makes hilarious understatements and offbeat comments . cheerful psychopath revels in random murderous rampages . nigh indestructible goliaths hurl one another through a series of walls and other physical traumas that would kill a mere mortal . man dispatches dozens of gun wielding enemies with nothing but skillful swordplay . common sense and the laws of physics , biology and chemistry temporarily abandoned . antagonist using loved one 's murder as justification for misguided crusade . i could go on but this is just exhausting . if you 're over the age of twelve and not living in mom 's basement , there 's probably nothing here for you . depressingly enough , it 's not too far off of par for superhero movies so discount all i 've written if you ca n't get enough of the genre .
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist . the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma mst3k . it 's super bowl at the superdome in new orleans . however , no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . with the many stars in this film , it made no difference . i really do n't know why i watched this .
i rented `` new best friend '' hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as `` gossip '' and `` the curve '' . instead , `` new best friend '' is much more like `` the in crowd '' , in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony . `` new best friend '' is boring , and the events during the movie are the same . skip this movie ... it 's a waste of time .
believe it or not , `` the woodchipper massacre '' gave me full-blown gonorrhea ! that 's right , i 've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution . it 's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film . the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing ( not without several suicide attempts along the way ) was because , well first off , i was delirious with boredom , and second - i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing ... this movie is a 'shot-on-video ' `` horror/comedy '' about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt . the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo-replica hunting knife . they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools ( apparently she did n't have a single drop of blood in her body ! ) and heave her into their dad 's rented wood chipper ... her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too ... i do n't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea . seriously , that one blond chick 's voice had me wincing in pain constantly . all of the actors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must 've been written by a chimp that just did n't care ! now , i can usually appreciate independent efforts , but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this ! i do n't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous , painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous , fluttery music playing over it . plus , why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it ? ! there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it ! i 'm through with reminiscing about this movie . unless you like insufferable crap , i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash .
having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly . i thought lion king 1.5 might be worth watching . what a disappointment ! disney must be getting desperate for revenues . especially now that they lost the deal with pixar . basically , they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor 's floor ( or garbage can ) and glued them together to make a quick buck . unlike lk i & ii , both of which had strong story lines . this movie hardly has a story at all . while the characters and animation are always fun to look at , there is simply not enough material here for a movie . some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings . disney - shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck ! next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work .
i 'll say this much -- this director is all about raw images ... things most of us are not ready to confront head-on . images of sex , suicide , murder , and people `` relieving themselves '' are constantly bombarding the viewer , which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release . although i do n't think that i could ever see this movie again , i will say that the director does have a good eye . there were some really nice shots and `` picture moments '' in the film ( the fans , the wire fish in their hair ) , but the story left me needing more ( strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves `` what the heck did we just see ? '' ) . note : if you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily ... do n't see this film .
i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film . look at it a month later and you might see it differently , or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first . after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere , it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself . shane danielsen ( artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival ) , aided by the film 's director and producer , gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience . edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked . only one person walked out in disgust . the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m.a . film directors . this was not an overly 'shocking ' film . there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence , but far less extreme than many movies ( most actual weapon contact was obscured , as were aroused genitals ) . the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring , where the acting standards were not high , where the plot was poor , predictable and drawn out , and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie . metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived , over-emphasised and sloppy ( apart from a general allusion to violence , any deeper meaning is unclear ) ; and the 'fig-leaf ' reference marquis de sade , as one audience member put it , seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale . we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him ( he stands out at school for his musical ability ) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence . when pushed , robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him . the film is not entirely without merit . the audience is left to decide how robert got that way : was it the influence of his peers ? why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life ? cinematically , there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back ( whether through too much drugs , shyness , a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn ? ) . several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room , partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen . in the foreground of the bare bones flat , a dj is more concerned that the girl 's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman . ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention . the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way . robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground . but the rest of the film , including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable ( if not overly realistic ) sexual violence , is not up to this standard . some people have had a strong reaction to it ( the filmmakers ' stated intention : `` if they vomit , we have succeeded in producing a reaction '' ) but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel , `` why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making ? '' director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision . his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet , even his defence that there is little plot development because he did n't want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms , but unfortunately they do not apply to his film , any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates , or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols . wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt , i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening , but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial . there are many truths . one aspect of art is to educate , another to entertain , another to inspire . i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach ( one of the many great names he takes in vain ) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself . he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth . i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director , or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work andy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art . clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries . sadly , his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuses for a publicity-seeking film .
the character of tarzan has been subjected to so many clichés , and so many bad interpretations , that those who are hoping for a different kind of version ( people like me , i mean , who liked the tarzan books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little ) ought to know how the recent renditions stack up . some of the imdb reviews address this point , but here 's my $ .02 i am aware of only two -- count 'em -- cinema depictions of tarzan , namely greystoke with christopher lambert and the disney animated version , that try to depict edgar rice burrough 's rather interesting character ( the son of a marooned english noble couple , picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves , and who becomes `` lord of the jungle '' because of his superior human intellect before making it back to england and claiming his other identity ) rather than the usual hollywood jungle-man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell , his mysterious inability to speak proper english despite long exposure to people who know the language , his habit of swinging on vines , his strength , heroism , etc . about the only thing these two characters have in common are the name tarzan and the fact that they both have a wife named jane . ron ely 's tv version is something of a compromise : like burroughs ' character , he speaks good english and is adept and suave in both cultures in a sort of jamesbondish way , but he 's no lord greystoke and there 's no jane . well , this film is in a third category of tarzan films , and i hope it remains a category of one because it 's awful . this category uses the character as a vehicle for , of all things , soft porn . jane , played by legendarily bad actress bo derek is in africa looking for her dad the absent-minded professor who is combing the jungle looking for something which is never specified . though her dad is supposed to have been missing for a long time , she finds him effortlessly . richard harris as the dad is the best thing here ; he sees the film is stupid so he has fun overacting and hamming in a way that reminds me of peter o'toole 's deliberately silly performance in what 's new pussycat . dad explains the legend of tarzan ( `` some sort of ghost or spirit '' he says -- either a steal from , or an inartistic attempt at homage to , king kong ) to his daughter , who is at this point unfamiliar with the ape-man . shortly afterward , we hear the infamous cliché of the tarzan yell . dad dies , which oddly does n't seem to faze his devoted daughter very much . and then ..... then tarzan appears , but says nothing . indeed , he says nothing during the entire film . he and jane fall in love , and they romp around wearing almost nothing as she recites doggerel love-poetry off-screen . the end . that 's the plot . well , not exactly ; there 's also a scene where tarzan wrestles unrealistically with a boa constrictor -- a most unusual boa , since it 's the only poisonous one ever seen . jane treats the bite with the aid of a chimp who helps by wringing out the garment she tears off to bind the wound with ( i 'm not making this up ! ) , and this is only one of many excuses for her to take her clothes off . i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive , but this time it 's hard . let 's see ... well , it 's unfair to criticize this film for featuring an orangutan , even though we all know orangutans do n't live in africa ; after all , the classic tarzan movies all used indian elephants , did they not ? also , you have to admit that bo derek is pretty in face and form . ( but in that case why the hell did n't she just make a career as an art model ? what does it say about a movie when it becomes plain boring to look at a pretty woman ? i actually have n't decided whether it 's a positive or a negative that they never showed her crotch . ) but now i realize : try as i may , i ca n't end on a positive note . see this film if you 're a bad film buff . i 'm outa here .
when people ask me whats the worst movie i 've ever seen its this one . its not even close to mst3k level riffing , or midnight viewing at a theatre , or even as disney channel late night filler . the only time i 've ever wanted to jump off a ride at disney world ( or disney/mgm studios in this case ) was to grab dick tracey 's jacket off the mannequin , rip it to shreds , and ram it down the tour guides throat saying `` eat this ! eat this unholy coat of darkness ! ! ! '' i 've never been so mad at a movie , not even `` nutty professor ii : the klumps '' or `` flash gordon '' . you want pretty colors and cinematography ? ai n't here babe . reviewers keep saying `` oh , but its too look like a comic book '' , well , to me , its the color of a gordito after several weeks in the sun . about as enjoyable too . beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch , himself , and occasional at the other actors , hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting . to be fair , i have only seen this movie once , but my pain threshold is that of a man , not a god .
if you were to judge based on the movie alone , the committee that gave the stage musical `` a chorus line '' a pulitzer prize , and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for 15 years , were all on heavy narcotics , because one singular sensation this film certainly is not . what possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me , but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of clay . not content with the original score the way it was originally written , someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip . thus we are assaulted with the oscar-nominated ( ! ) `` surprise , surprise . '' well surprise , surprise , the song stinks , and so does the movie . grade : d
first off ... with names like fred olen ray , brinke stevens and jan-michael vincent , plus distributors like `` rhino '' and `` troma '' on the video box , you know what you 're getting into with this one . b movie mania ! if you 're actually expecting to see a thriller `` based on edgar allan poe , '' then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films . this is pure , unadulterated sleaze ( with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to `` the premature burial '' ) , complete with lots of r-rated , ready-for-video sex and nudity . however , it 's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way ... brinke ( who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes ) plays rich , traumatized , insomniac housewife victoria monroe , whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father ( hoke howell ) . her worthless husband terry ( jay richardson ) has racked up some serious gambling debt ( owed to a gangster played by robert quarry ) and , with help from his kinky , blonde , european-accented sexpot secretary lisa ( delia sheppard ) plots to do away with brinke for her money . name-value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist ( she 's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this ) , 50s sci-fi/horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living vicki . jan-michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home . the kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before , the ending is an unintentional laugh riot ( concluding with a direct rip-off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror ) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit . brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic , but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role . she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here .
after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series . so , i already expected it to have a lacking storyline , but at least this time it wo n't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans . unfortunately , i was wrong . if you could only imagine a fast & furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you . this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen ( i 'm being nice - no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said ) . not only was the storyline non-existent , but the action was crap too . i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie . for an example , there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a slr mclaren to win . and after the bit where eddy griffin got in a fight with one of his `` girls '' ( an imus comment would work in this case ) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert . after this wonderful scene i could n't take it anymore . so , i only got to see half of this monstrosity . this is the first movie i had ever walked out on . afterwards , i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells . i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option . you 're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home . i will keep all viewers in my prayers .
watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes . it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy . the setup was promising , in the 1920 's cecil b. demille makes his opus of the ten commandments . it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil ( do n't they always ? ) . aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down . hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time . then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site ( the movie 's first mistake , but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci-fi channel movie ) . the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it 's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect . then the body counts starts . this is were the movie went south for me . the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction . once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do ? they make the usual stop to the `` guy who knows the truth but never told anyone '' . after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site ? no , they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk . really i 'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i 'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem . after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way , by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it 's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades . for a sci-fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out , which is n't saying much at all . what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it .
wow . watching this film today , you ca n't help but be appalled by the writing of this film . spencer tracy and loretta young play a couple who , in modern times , might be featured on `` the jerry springer show '' -- as they have a sick and abusive relationship ... and inexplicably , the writers appear to be endorsing it ! the film begins with a hungry and homeless loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful spencer tracy . he shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay . it 's never clear whether or not they marry -- and considering it 's a pre-code film , you can assume they are n't even though they are cohabiting . their relationship is very strange ... and rather sick . while you can see that tracy cares about her by his actions , he is verbally abusive and a total jerk -- -and young comes running back for more like some sort of dog . he calls her `` skinny '' or `` ugly '' and these are , in a sick way , his way of using endearments ! later , when he starts fooling around with another woman ( glenda farrell ) , she tells her friend that if that 's what he wants , it 's okay with her ! ! ! it sure smacks of a sado-masochistic relationship and you ca n't help but feel a bit horrified . sure , he does n't hit her but the relationship is very abusive . to show how sick it is , when young gets pregnant , she tells him `` ... it 's your baby and it 's mine , but you do n't need to worry , i 'll take all the blame for it '' ! ! yikes ! does n't this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home ? ! later , in a case of art imitating life , tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears . after all , he ca n't be burdened with a baby -- even if it 's his . but , he changes his mind and decides to return home . wow ... that 's bit of him ! and , when he returns , he 's nasty and acts like if he stays , he is n't obligated to care for the kid ! ! and , she tells him he 's `` a free man ... free as a bird '' ! wow , i was almost in tears at this tender moment ... not ! soon , this crazy pair are married ... and , naturally , young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him -- not because of any love or sense of responsibility . so how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters ? what would you do ? well , as for the writers , they have tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat ! the romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least ! during the robbery , tracy behaves like a chump -- doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught -- like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison . and , to show what sort of nice guy he is , the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends . while there 's more to the film , the bottom line is that tracy is a jerk and young is an idiot in the film . despite both being very good actors , there 's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced . nice music , nice sets , good acting ... and a script that is 100 % poo . how the film is currently rated 7.4 is beyond me and i wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters . a horrible misfire that somehow did n't destroy the careers of those involved . oh , and if you wonder if loretta ever gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong , the answer is no ! by the end , she 's learned nothing and has n't changed one whit for the better . they sure do n't make films like they used to ... and in this case ... thank god !
a text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house , but i think the more apt word is `` entropy . '' good grief , what slobs these two babes are ! george ( seymour cassell ) is alone in his san francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in tiburon while his wife and child are away in san diego . two girls ( sondra locke as jackson and colleen camp as donna ) knock on his door , asking directions . well , it 's raining , and they 're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens , and they 're not sure of the address they 're looking for , and , what with one thing and another , george invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire . all three of them wind up in george 's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure , triple exposure , quadruple exposure , and dodekakuple exposure . they spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast . but something has gotten slightly cockeyed because georgie 's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and -- `` you eat like animals ! `` , george exclaims and tells them to get out . in his dreams . now , do n't get me wrong . sondra locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt-blue eyes and colleen camp bounces around like a superball . you got ta say , they breed 'em mighty cute down there in shelbyville , tennessee , where locke comes from , and they breed 'em with bodacious tushes too , as we ca n't help but note after the first five or ten minutes . but when the girls go berserk , so does the movie . the film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light . the pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors . they brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure . they cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture . they have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another , licking food and then jumping each other 's bones . and georgie ? they first render georgie unconscious with mace ( which contains nothing that you ca n't find in that little red bottle of mcilheny 's tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet ) , tie him up , pour flour and milk all over him , subject him to a psychotic trial , put him through one of those tolstoy-type semi-executions , slap him around , dress up in outlandish costumes , then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper-middle-class home , and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina . as for the acting , it 's as if someone had told georgie , `` first act polite to these girls , then act panicked after you 're tied up . '' and to the girls : `` first act shy , unwilling to impose on anyone , then act crazy . '' and that 's it . the photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie . i 'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill . it takes effort and talent to turn san francisco ugly . the score gives us two leitmotivs . georgie 's is some pop tune with lyrics about `` being free '' and `` giving in . '' jackson and donna 's is a catchy rinky-tink thing called `` my good old dad . '' i approve of the moral lesson behind the story , though . there are some things you should simply not give in to , even though they might look like a lot of fun at first . all very educational .
this movie should be number one on the bottom 100 . the acting is so horrible that when my son and i watched it we nearly got physically ill. and the story is worse . i could go on and on about how bad it is but all i really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob 's review as i see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet . do n't waste your time , money , energy or anything else on this movie . thank goodness we saw it on tv so we did n't spend anything on it . had we , i would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction . in conclusion , i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act . but i am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film . do n't spoil your opinion of carrie by viewing it .
this is hands down the worst movie i can ever remember watching . everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded . the acting was horrible too . the camera work was n't bad but that still could n't redeem it . the writer/director of this film must suffer from down 's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career . i want the hour and a half of my life back that i wasted watching this crap . i would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this . i cant believe imdb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but i feel that this movie is so bad that i must continue to warn others about it . the reason i came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the kris kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled `` disappearances '' . i do n't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my dvd player but i feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time , pain and suffering . in conclusion , the director/writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street .
these writings write about the end of the plot so do n't read it if you have n't seen this rubbish . i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror . if i owned a video store i 'd put it in the boring section . this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks . this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary . well i drive to work and back ( and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats ) almost every day and trust me it 's not scary . it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving . even the little kid does it too . round and round he goes and he never stops . what 's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour ? i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too . the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens . then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason . that 's all that happens and as you can see it 's rubbish .
there is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre . i was thinking about jordan playing baseball , but the same applies to steve martin . this movie is reasonably well acted and directed , but the script is a stinker . martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in `` roxanne '' , but this effort to bring a victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility . if you want to see an old story updated with some style , best to rent `` great expectations '' .
up to this point , gentle rain was the movie i found the worst in history . it has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster ' out of asia . it has one `` star '' and it is john rhys davies . he is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling , magical flying baddie he is cast here . the rest of these people could n't act their way out of a junior high school play . no clichés were missed in the dialogue , and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible . it is fairly easy to see that somebody in asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at . or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit . my guess is that any career with this movie in it 's credential do yourself a major favor and do n't watch this movie . a hundred thanksgivings could n't consume this turkey . the one funny scene was unintentional . the brother of the king appears on the scene . the king ? a handsome , older , short asian actor . ( bad actor . ) the brother ? a six foot european . ( also a bad actor . ) no excuses were made for this . they just expected us not to notice that this poor man 's jet li 's brother was a wannabe pierce brosnan in a cheap dimestore `` injun '' wig right out of an old western movie from the forties .
was this a comedy or was it a drama ? i begin this review by asking this question because the film that i just witnessed , hollywood shuffle , was neither funny or rather dramatic . while it tried so hard to make a point , because of this lack of definition ( comedy or drama ) , the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost . while i am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in hollywood , even today , i do not believe that townsend 's directorial debut did much to stop it . instead , i feel it only added more fuel to the fire . townsend 's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of , he was instead promoting and vice versa . the parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy . townsend had a decent concept with this film , but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film . if you watch the preview before the film ( which i constantly do ) , you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see . the preview gives the impression of a very intelligent , comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers , but the actually film could not be further from the truth . the main problem with hollywood shuffle is not story itself ( because it is lacking in elaboration ) ; it is townsend 's direction . he had a wonderful concept with this film . exploit the hollywood that exploits our race . decent idea , but why could n't he execute it very well ? the first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic . the structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital , we are literally everywhere without any warning or map . it was obvious that townsend had quite a bit to say , but only a short amount of time to do it in . so , instead of defining his characters , developing his themes , and actually creating a smart film , he just throws it all together and prays that it works . sadly , it does n't . instead of a smart comedy , we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas , comedic skits , and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable . what hurts townsend the most are his brief , attempt to be funny , interruptions throughout the film . from battling a villain known as jerry curl to parodying siskel & ebert , townsend 's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters . this is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally . while townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in hollywood , he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and cliché in the book . what could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest . so , if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story , perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story . wrong ! the wayans are in this film , but townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family . definitely in their pre-in living color moments , we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon . perhaps it was townsend 's direction , or just maybe this atrocious story , but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film . i just thought that with the talent pool that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny , bright , and a true stab at this obvious hollywood dilemma . sadly , it was none of the above . finally , i would like to say that this was a workable film . there were some moments ( while they were few and way far between ) that had a smile on my face , the final product just did n't settle well with me . townsend can be funny , but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself , instead of through his personal experiences and troubles . i realize that he was probably speaking the truth , but it never came through as that . instead , we are threaded through a weak story , which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom , but surely did n't work for this film . even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film , i would have to disagree . if you are starting fresh , either have a tight script or defined themes . townsend had neither of these , and combined with the inability to control his actors , he just failed in a ball of flames . overall , this was rather disappointing to watch . it reminded me of a grade school spelling bee where it is finally your child 's time to spell . the word is tough , but as the first two to three letters come out , you think that it is going to work perfectly , but then there is that random `` p '' and silent `` r '' that forces your excitement to come tumbling down . that is how i felt with hollywood shuffle . at first , i saw the potential , i saw the theme and the motive behind the picture , but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes , i experienced that deep fall feeling . townsend sank his own ship on this one , and i do n't think hollywood shuffle will ever re-submerge as a pivotal moment of hollywood cinema . grade : * out of * * * * *
although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen , the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film ( and more than once after that ) . the plot development is disjointed and slow , the verbal diarrhoea of the main character 's only friend is practically insufferable , the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying . it is typical of ventura pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters . however , this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from caricias or caresses , where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film . in amor idiota we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman . supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script does n't support that . i wo n't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention ? even though i watched the whole thing i was n't made to care even for a moment about either of them . if you can sit through all this prejudice , ignorance , betrayal , bad dialogue , flimsy philosophy , etc the camera-work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the dogma group . the makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst i 've seen cayetana guillen cuervo in any of her movies ( while in person she is actually attractive ) . i suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then pons has achieved his objective . the barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film ( if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance ) . true that i heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes . save yourselves and watch something else .
yesterday was earth day ( april 22 , 2009 ) in the us and other countries , and i went to see the full-feature movie-version of `` earth '' by disneynature . i guess , like the auto manufacturers , disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet . maybe they really do care about the planet , i do n't know , but i do n't think it warrants a special unit with the word `` nature '' in it . i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse , and who am i to tell a one-year old my personal feelings about disney ? aside from incredible cinematography , it was a typical disney disappointment for me . preceded by a half-dozen disney movie trailers , rife with disney cliché ( `` circle of life '' , `` falling with style '' ) , over-dramatic music , recycled footage ( disney claims `` 40 % new footage '' ) . i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring . i like james earl jones , but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin . i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done , they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites on it . and what is disney 's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals ? there were a half-dozen such scenes , complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out . i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents . i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change . are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it 's still a controversial subject ? i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix . nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment .
let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected , not to say revered author , in order to draw attention to their home-movies out on dvd . hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers , in fact lied about only to be revealed , finally , as ludicrously inept in every department , the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer-producer-director since it appeared on dvd . many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page . particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students , since this `` film '' does not even use the basic grammar of scripting , editing , continuity , direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time . it is possible the director did show up for the shoot . certainly there was no-one present who knew even remotely what they were doing . an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their $ 9.00 outlay . much was promised . absolutely nothing was delivered . except `` monty python meets `` war of the worlds '' with all the humour taken out . indefensible trash . just unbelievable . there are real independent film-makers out there to be checked out . people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be . people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film-maker jake west 's `` evil aliens '' for example .
i 'm glad some people liked this , but i hated this film . it had a very good idea for a story line , but that 's where it ended . it was badly written , badly acted and badly made . it had some interesting plot points , but they were just skipped over too fast , the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits , like lying about why she was kidnapped , and ditch the dross . instead it was `` what 's going on ? `` , 5 seconds later they tell you . this film had no suspense , and i was bored from start to end . i just wanted it to finish . go and rent misery , or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end .
i had recently been watching johnny test in an attempt to find humor in it . i failed , horribly . cartoon network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences , but johnny test is `` entertainment '' in it 's lowest form . the writing is incredibly predictable , and the running gags are n't much gags at all . kids will love it , and that 's about it . now , this is n't to say that it 's all bad . the original opening theme was actually pretty catchy , but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat . it 's a shame , because that was really one of the best things it had going for it . some of the characters could be very interesting , in theory . with a little work , the characters could work well together , but they 're too one-dimensional . then again , this makes it easy for the kids to follow . the pace is a bit too fast as well . the episodes are too busy , leaving little time for clever writing . this is a real shame , because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth . on the upside , however , the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest , and that 's really the entirety of the target audience . overall , the show looks very good on paper , but just does n't succeed in being funny or interesting . this is a show i want to like , but i 'm incapable of it . there 's just so much potential that is n't realized . kids will enjoy it , but that 's about it .
this is n't a bad movie ... but it 's the type your girlfriend makes you watch . the story is n't bad .... it just makes the hour and a half seem so long . it 's hard for me to trash this movie because i really do like the idea of it but it was just to long and thin on story ... too bad . the main character never really seems to change all that much from beginning to end . i mean goes through something `` life changing '' and he can barely break a smile . i really thought mac was really good . his weird quirkiness kept the movie from being a complete disaster . maybe i just do n't `` get '' this film . if anyone can explain it to me i 'd love to be informed .
i could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end . i can not comment on the story as i did not watch the whole film and the reason i could n't watch it was because of the 'actors ' . firstly , for the most part they just looked stiff and i 'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but that 's a minor issue . the main issue i have with the actors is n't really their fault ... it 's whoever cast this film ! come on , this movie came out in 2003 ... i thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave ? ! i can not watch a movie where one of the first lines , from a grown man older than myself , is `` i 'm 17 ! '' how can anyone take that seriously ? ? ? ? ? do n't fall victim to this movie , go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you 'll get far more than this movie could ever give .
the fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list should n't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more lionel 'oliver ' blair than brecht . the acting talent is shamefully misused : migenes and walters are good but do n't have to try very hard : migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . julia looks perfect as mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . harris 's peachum is embarrassingly mannered and polly is atrocious . the adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on marc blitzstein 's bowdlerised broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . and the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement vittorio storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . disgraceful .
not an altogether bad start for the program -- but what a slap in the face to real law enforcement . the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare -- and is anything but . men and women that dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this . what is next , medical school in a minute ? charo performing lipo ? charles grodin assisting on a hip replacement ? c'mon ... show a little respect . even the citizens of muncie are outing the program as staged . police academy = high school gym ? poor editing ( how many times can they use the car-to-car shot of the taco bell in the background ? ) , cheesy siren effects ( the same loop added ad nauseum to every 'call ' whether rolling code or not ) , and last , but not least -- more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at . if i want to see manufactured police work and wise-ass fake cops , i would watch reno 911 .
i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place , but baba was a huge disappointment . in between an awful storyline , the action and songs were only mediocre . the storyline becomes very preachy . instead of running for office like ntr or mgr , rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil nadu 's next big guru . my wife tells me that since this film came out , rajni swore off doing any more movies ! we were lucky initially to have bought babu ( an oldie by sivajiganeshan ) online by accident when trying to buy this one .... that was a great film , which made up for having bought this dud ... except it makes baba look even worse by comparison ! bryan
after waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep , i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep deprivation . this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it . what a mistake ! here is the plot ( potential spoilers , if you even care ) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy ( josh kornbluth ) works as a temp for some ridiculous company . suddenly , he is offered the chance to `` go perm , '' which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie . but with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp , josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he does n't want to do it . he hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . his inability to send several `` very important '' letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious , but is merely stupid . josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together ( obviously a fantasy of josh 's in real life , as such a thing would never happen ) . a bunch of other stuff happens , but it 's too trite and inane to go into now . despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy , i only laughed twice during it ; the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth ( my initial reaction was one of stifling fear ) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman ( yeah , right ) . josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person i have ever seen in my life . he is an unattractive , overweight , balding jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . i do not at all sympathize with josh 's character . he is lazy and unmotivated and i just do n't appreciate the failed attempts at humor . skip it , even if your life depends upon it .
despite some moments in heavy rain , an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey , and a stay in a sanitarium , this roscoe `` fatty '' arbuckle silent comedy short with support from buster keaton and al st. john is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster that 's the ultimate in `` meet cute '' scenes especially since it 's one of the few times we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movies ! also , many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock . still , if you 're an arbuckle or keaton completist , good night , nurse ! is certainly worth a look .
i am so confused . what in the world was this movie about ? what was the killer 's motivation ? he seemed quite angry , but i have yet to figure out why . nothing in this movie made sense . it had zero depth . or less than zero depth . which i guess would make it a hill . or a pile . of crap . the acting was horrible . when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie , they had been in very few things that i had heard of , and that came as absolutely no surprise . i ca n't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad , or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again . starting . . . now ! ( seinfeld reference . ) really , though , do n't waste your time with this . there 's so little substance that there 's nothing there even just to make fun of . this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- no , one of the worst flicks of any kind , that i have ever had the misfortune to watch , and i 've seen quite a few .
this has to be one of the worst movies of all time . the graphics were horrendous , the acting was b-movie and the effects were just plain nintendo 64 qualified . you would think that they would put a little more effort into it . of course , it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate , but this one takes the cake . hell , i 'm still laughing . so , as a shake-your-head in disbelief movie , this one does well . although it appears to have some 'known ' actors and actresses in this , it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort . the graphics might have been good in the '60 's or even early '70 's but come on , this is 2009 ! i wont give spoilers out , let 's just say that if you have played `` jurassic park '' on the nintendo 64 you will be very familiar with what you see in this film it is definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
every movie from the thirties is dated , but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others . i.e . grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama . with ford , there 's always the hard-sell of someone 's nobility ( abe , the joads ) . always the over-emphasis of some heavy 's badness . always the poorly crafted , awkward and obvious scripts . this is no exception . it 's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment . and sentiment is all this has going for it . what ford does here does n't make me appreciative of lincoln , it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here . ford went on to make decent movies . this is too dated to be anything but bad . it feels entirely false . henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre . and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing 's , ' or say `` shonuff ! ''
i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious `` the gamers '' by dead gentlemen productions ( which is highly recommendable , by the way ) . boy , what a disappointment ! the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver . the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing . true , it can be funny to use every singe cliché there is about role playing games , but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable . already at the beginning of each scene you know what the `` joke '' will be about . but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top . there is no subtlety in this movie , if there would be captions `` laugh now '' or a cheap 80s-style fake-laughter track it would not make much difference . with some scenes you ca n't help to think `` yea , i get why they thought this would be funny '' but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke .
when discussing a movie titled 'snakes on a plane ' , we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot . what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy , they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures ? why not rely on suspense .. the whole 'less is more ' ethic . or better still , why not just make them look good in the first place ? and then maybe still use them sparingly take one look at john carpenters 'the thing ' . here we have real slime , and gore of eerie proportions . 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap 'snakes on a plane ' . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee ? special effects are going backwards ! sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke , get it ? sure i 'm with that idea , but do it well ! in addition to the above , this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way . i could handle every other actor being part of this movie , except for jackson . what was he doing there ? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago . is this career progression ? are you offering people value for money ? no . i 'd like to know what tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including ... doa : dead or alive , ( another ) cgi animal film called 'flushed away ' , and another crap looking comedy named 'click ' . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers , including one for ( another ) crap british horror/comedy . i 've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time expect to see this movie for sale in the dvd bargain section for £1 in 6 months time . and if you 're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes , and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .
nothing to say but wow ! has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field ? well this happens about 25 times in this movie ( clearly the directors ' favorite scare tactic ) . in one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film . shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and , although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute . after about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown 's history in which we see some of his previous victims . if you watch this movie check out the ladies chest .. her ribs go all the way to her neck , it was flat out disgusting . most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day . the few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the blair witch project or random shots from the directors backyard . the movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically . definitely rent this movie if you have ever been snuck up on in an open field . signed , the answer
i have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film . while some people walked out of the film , i decided to stay , only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting , lack of suspense , ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line . i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film . the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack . this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing . in retrospect , i would n't even rent this one , let alone pay more than $ 5 to see .
the angry red planet ( quickie review ) like `` the man from planet x , '' this is a bizarre science fiction tale culled from an era where fantasy and science fiction were still damn near the same thing . meaning , we have some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction . and yes , it 's another `` classic '' released in a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and sharp sound -- by midnite movies . so , the main reason to watch this film ? oh , it 's definitely the whole time our space crew is on mars . ( what , you thought `` angry red planet '' referred to neptune ? ) prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship , inside of which they smoke and toss around sexist chauvinistic banter aimed at the `` puny female '' member of the crew . it 'd be somewhat offensive by today 's standards if it were n't so damn funny . but mars is the real reason we 're watching this thing . the film is generally black and white , but mars , well mars is screaming bloody red . it 's filmed in this bizarre red plasticy sheen giving the angry red planet quite an interesting look of overexposed redness . it 's really quite a sightas are the ( ha ha ) aliens viewers are to witness . the best being the `` ratbatspidercrab . '' you think that 's a joke ? that 's what they call it in the movie ! it 's a gigantic chimera ( small puppet ) of a thing combining traits of rats , bats , spiders , and crabs . it bounds along all puppety and scares the sh * t out of our `` heroic crew . '' there are other weird , and poorly imagined , aliens to be seen , but that one takes the cake . eventually , after their harrowing experience on mars , the sexist crew boards their `` ship '' and returns to whatever planet it was they came from . this ai n't for everyone . science fiction film buffs & curiosity seekers , and some general film buffs . fans of mystery science theater 3000 will have a field day with this one ( if they never got to it on the show ) . 2/10 modern score , 6/10 nostalgia score , 4/10 overall .

it is only robert de niro film which i really hates . it is stupid film with horrible acting ( of course not de niro ) . for me , brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface ( 1983 ) or the untouchables ( 1987 ) . i also loved de palma 's mission : impossible ( 1996 ) . de niro worked with palma two different times too , greetings and the wedding party . i though that the wedding party was ok too ( i did n't watch greetings ) . screenplay is really bad and unfunny . there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time . film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a `` be black baby '' scene and also i do n't like the scene where a guy 's sexual organ appeared . so , it is one of the worst film i have ever seen ! just worst . i hate that .
one of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying , it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . one of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they ( the yuppies ) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . while the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning , i find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . if these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home , i would bet that american psycho would be one of those movies .
what a terrible , terrible , film ! one of the worst movies i have seen in my life . i usually love movies like this , the whole `` a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes , but he happens to already be involved with someone , who not right for him .... '' . i expected something predictable and i did n't mind . the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy , but not this one ! every single joke falls flat and the `` romance '' makes me want to vomit . the title character is one of the most `` please kill me '' characters that i have ever witnessed on my television , the `` eccentric woman '' is n't very eccentric , more like quirky and annoying . the `` other someone '' is the most reasonable , mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying . this films flat out sucks , there 's no way around it , do n't waste your time .
the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood , whose work i admire immensely . the leads had absolutely no chemistry . not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them . the story just did n't ring true . add to that stilted conversation , tons of stereotypes , and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere , and you 've got yourself a real stinker . kay lenz 's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare , but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time . my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled `` cheesy . ''
a very weak movie , mainly because of a poor story , but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr. , and irrational behaviour by many of the characters . if you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it 's creativity or acting criteria , then you may like this movie . personally i ca n't do that with a drama and found this too far-fetched . i 'm particularly annoyed when a main character , that is supposed to be an intelligent person , continually acts like a complete imbecile . in this movie , if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations , there would be no movie . the first highly unlikely act is when the main character , a successful attorney named magruder , played by kenneth branagh , is leaving a party and happens upon a girl , mallory doss played by embeth davidtz , who is screaming that her car has been stolen . they are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home . she tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things . when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town , they notice that her car is in the driveway . also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken . things are very odd , she 's weird ( looking like a tramp , she undresses in front of him until she 's completely naked oh yeah ! ) . also , the father 's strange , the house is a wreck -- everything should have told magruder , `` hey this is too weird for me , i 'm out of here ! ' but not magruder , he sleeps with her and then , motivated by her story and sex , takes up the case of trying to have her father committed . it all screams set-up ! then , being the top-flight attorney that he is , he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before , ( a fact that all of the women in the office notice ) . is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year-old ? magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming , with ample evidence , that the father is terrorising them , the police ignore him . i could have believed begrudging assistance . but no help at all -- not likely ! it 's just too unlikely .
the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on 13 nov 1918 . the troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the french army , including the legion , marched off to war in 1914 ! this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey . ( the french army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working . metropolitan french troops were put into `` horizon blue '' and colonial troops were put into khaki . ) the claude van-damme ( sp ? ) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right . really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right .
it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies - especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black - have been situation spoofs , which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs . i found the sheer absurdity of zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released , starsky and hutch was also enjoyable , and then dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people , although personally i was a bit tired of the over-the-top characters - especially when the scenario was n't quite so funny ( perhaps the comedy of a dodgeball tournament does n't quite translate to australia , where it 's rarely played ) . so in an attempt to do something a little more original , envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of jack black 's character ( i wo n't spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie ) . the problem is that the movie seems to drag , i 'm not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples , but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before - and very rarely successfully . so instead of a nice , crisp , enjoyable and fresh comedy , you get a film that seems to just go through the motions . sure the motions can be quite amusing , and they 're centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs - especially with jack black playing the excited and amusing , though a bit 2d , creator . ben stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost , he 's asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his zoolander breed of movies , but he struggles as a family man , whether his fault or the scripts , there is n't enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of ben stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious . the performance does n't leave an imprint on the viewer ( he 's just ben stiller , jack black manages to actually portray a character - though not a challenging one ) . the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walken 's role as 'the j man ' , which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come , and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly . it 's really not as unbearable as some people would have you think , it 's watchable , especially if you 're in the right mood ( feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film ) . hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after you 've watched a scary film and feel like something light - hopefully you 'll also be somewhat tipsy by then too . in that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable , but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along .
it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air . there 's been one couple that has stayed together , married , and has children , but everyone else has broken up . what 's the point of continuing this ? the show can be entertaining at the beginning . you see all the girls swooning over one man , that almost all of them like instantly . it 's just like in real life ! the girls start to take sides , bitch one another out , and show their true selves ( or so we think ) . but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after . what is true love exactly ? how can you fall for someone when you 're forced to pick them ? this show is unbelievable . you thought dating online was bad , but people have to go on tv to find love ? it 's not realistic . how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others , making out with them ? none of these questions are answered , and finally when the show ends , you know there wo n't be a happy ending in the future . for all we know , everything is scripted .
this film was n't programmed in italian cinemas , i have seen it at a manifestation called `` fantafestival '' .i find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark , the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there 's no suspence in the film . music is completely out of the story and i do n't have words to describe the visual effects.if you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting , but a few minutes later it becomes busy.the story is interesting but the development needs a complete review .
i 'm ask ... what a f * * * are whit the real-tv never i see some b * * * * * * * in my life is : a * * * * * * , dirty , f * * * * * * bad and other a * * * * * * * things but anything more is just a piece of american s * * * all time britney saying `` oh s * * * , i wan na see his cock , i wan na f * * * , and stuck his d * * * '' and he thinking `` oh like i gone to still her money '' it 's just another show of s * * * any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it 's just like i say another s * * * show in this s * * * sill out the money pure sex all f * * * * * * * time , i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wan na my f * * * * * * money
i can not for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children 's television show , power rangers is all about . i never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place , since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever . the costumes look completely atrocious , like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym . what exactly is the purpose of this show anyways , but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems ? what is up with the awful hair cuts , and clothing on this show anyway ? not to mention this show is still playing on cable television , just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem . there 's far better entertainment for today 's children , hopefully they are n't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show . oh , and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway ?
this film is probably pro-muslimization . why do i write that ? the main character has a muslim father and a christian mother . he lives his first 20 years in a christian village . in the end of the film he seemingly is a muslim because of his head-wear , that he has kept his amulet , and his general clothing . he has a six year old child , who wears the same head-wear and therefore is probably a muslim , although the mother is a christian . the main character thus chooses to , it seems , to be a muslim and his child becomes a muslim . no one of the other male main characters , which are christians , seems to breed a child . there are more muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it , it therefore seems .
this movie started out with some semblance of a plot , then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward . it was impossible to remain engaged with this film . this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability . it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio . clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney , not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control . that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation . this movie joins my very short `` worst movies of all time '' list .
i saw this film yesterday . i must admit , it were n't my cup of tea . although it 's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind . but as i was watching this , i was thinking .. 'this movie is n't making any sense at all .. ' where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from ? where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind ? where on earth did a shark came out from ? all these elements in this film somehow did n't add up . i felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap . i 've seen many good horror movies in my time , but this is one of the most worst horror flicks i 've seen . at the end of the movie , i said to myself that i would n't watch it again .. so much pappy show in this film , i 've decided to give it the thumbs down ! count me out on this one ! 0 out of 10 !
i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie . the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean pow camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine , going without bathing , shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas , and sleeping on bare floors , and - let 's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair . with the exception of a suitably austere-looking harry morgan as an army major , the casting and acting are simply awful . ronald regan can not seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles . a mostly caucasian cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable , but when supposedly russian officers acting as advisors to the koreans strut around wearing re-badged nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots ( obvious costume-department recycles from wwii flicks ) and speaking with accents like general burkhalter from hogan 's heroes , well , that 's just six kinds of silly . do n't waste your time on this one .
a film as bad as this should be withdrawn from all stores world wide . so full of boring , dull , unimaginative characters , and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice over for every action and feeling , this film holds the record for the most challenging film i have ever watched . as i had payed money to own it , i felt a duty to see it through , and how i regret it . my head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless , plot less lives . a bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything , are all frigid and worst of all , have terrible dialogue throughout , just mulling around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl . boring , so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and i was red with embarrassment that i 'd thrown away £6 . the dvd was on ebay the following day , and i did n't make much of my money back . avoid like the plague .
audrey , i know you truly cherish your husband ted 's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes . dr. seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason . we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories , images , fantasies and characters . they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway . the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books . it is indeed your property to do with as you wish . i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while . save what is left of dr. seuss . thank you .
fine performances and art direction do not a good movie make . this movie is so grim and depressing , i could feel absolutely no joy at the `` happy '' ending involving the union strike . the attempts at humor involving lake 's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous , and any movie involving a baldwin brother already has a strike against it . on a positive note , lang is still one of america 's great underrated actors , he alone almost makes this worth keeping in the vcr . i give this a 4 .
robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time . this movie is so wasteful of talent , it is truly disgusting . the script is unbelievable . the dialog is unbelievable . jane fonda 's character is a caricature of herself , and not a funny one . the movie moves at a snail 's pace , is photographed in an ill-advised manner , and is insufferably preachy . it also plugs in every cliche in the book . swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role , but so what ? equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review . when a movie is this worthless , it does n't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape . avoid this movie .
james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish . affleck is just a lightweight who just ca n't cut it , the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable . i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre , i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes . i walked out before the end it was so bad , so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo `` paul ross '' in one of the down market sundays . i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets , if he says the movie is good , i get straight on this very website to check it out . this movie should have gone straight to £1.99 dvd in a supermarket near you .
i do n't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business ! this movie ( short ) is gross ( to say the least ) ! it is a bunch of 5-7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins , acting like adults ( and too much so ! ) . however , it is interesting because it is a good example of how `` the good old days '' may not have been so good after all ! ( thank god we have laws against this kind of material now ! ) { this is one short from the `` shirley temple festival '' }
the book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you , but then , as it diverges more and more from the book , taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches , it becomes boring . still , from comments i 've heard , people who have not read the book tend to like it , and if it leads even on child to read a wrinkle in time , it will have served its purpose . the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary poppins ' uncle albert ( i love to laugh ) . nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .
you would n't expect a movie like this to be good , and it is n't . it 's a no budget , ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera ... and it 's hilarious . the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings . there is no plot to be seen . the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families . the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i 've ever seen . it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts , and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs . it 's a funny and sickening film , and it 's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie . my rating : bomb/ * * * * . 90 mins .
boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs , only this time she 's the punkette and he 's the straight arrow . movie-buffs out there actually like this movie ? it has fans ? i must say , the mind reels ... `` grease 2 '' is a truly lame enterprise that does n't even have the courage , moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames ( like `` jaws 2 '' or `` exorcist ii '' ) . no , it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead . it looks and feels cheap , with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling . this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and , although she does n't embarrass herself , it 's a role worth forgetting . a misfire on the lowest of levels . no stars from * * * *
if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie , then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you 'll never get back . i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re . first , a `` special '' commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection . and this `` hive '' rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time . there 's even a chess reference in the code names , which was in the dialog of re . despite the fact that there are no zombies , the `` rook '' , the movie 's nemesis , is some sort of bio-creature , very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue , with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re . so , a wag-of-the-finger to mr. richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story . they are not the same movie obviously , but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think .
i 'm a fan of matthew modine , but this film -- which i stumbled upon on cable -- is absolutely witless . i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same , so there was no one around to check her worst instincts . there are no surprises , no original lines , and no original characters . the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character . what a waste of all this acting talent . given how expensive it is to film in new york these days , i have to wonder how this got made in the first place . and if you 're wondering why i watched it at all , it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer . it 's not a very demanding picture !
`` kids like these '' could have been a decent film , given the subject matter . but instead it has become a below-average , run-of-the-mill tv-movie of the week , with not much going for it . the acting is stale , the plot predictable and the direction non-existent . for a better movie on the same subject , try the excellent `` le huitième jour '' , a film that really cares about the people with down-syndrome . in `` kids like these '' they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality . pretty appalling . 1/10
suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it - not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor . josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters . do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store .
great western i hear you all say ! brilliant first effort ! well i 'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw . great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none ! the acting was poor to say the least and i could n't care less about any of the characters , making the whole film pointless . the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those `` fact or fiction '' programmes on sci-fi . please , if you are looking for a good film , a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half , please look elsewhere .
this quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends . she finds that one , the daughter of the village priestess , drowned several years earlier . she and fumiko ( another childhood friend ) then learn that sayori 's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic . already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts . nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie . unlike stellar j-horror films , the suspense does n't really build , the result does n't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd . this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy . sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long . you end up eating it , because you need it with the meal , because what is chinese or japanese food without rice , but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey , gooey tastelessness of it all . 3/10 http : //blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
somewhere i 'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy . after seeing it , i 'd call it anything but . the point of this movie eludes me . the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd , many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts , and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content , there 's nothing erotic about this film ... all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about ! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun ( if politically incorrect ) comedy . instead , we 're treated to cheap , amateurish , unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake . if i want that , i 'll go buy a grace jones cd .
anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies . this movie was an insult to watch , the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography . the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion ! the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie . someone mentioned that this film was about a child 's imagination , okay thats all good and fine . but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did . i mean come on , the indian in the store . did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo ? which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here , so you think okay creepy ghost scenario , but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy . that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic . the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg ! ! ! why the hell did i just waste my time watching this ! ! this is a move that i recommend not to watch , there are definitely better quality films out there that wo n't insult your intelligence ! thank god i never had to pay to see this movie , i would have demanded my money back ! for those that were easily entertained by this movie .... it 's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie .
nahhh ! leila ( grace mills ) is a teenager turned on to satan ( and lsd ) by her archaeologist fiancé richard . there 's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle , where leila and richard drink blood , drop drugs , join in sex orgies , dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants , masks and capes and the women do n't wear anything at all . unfortunately , these kind of extracurricular activities have left leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded `` spirit of evil . '' leila also comes from a screwed up family , which does n't help either . her older brother john is a recluse who seems to be in love with her . her mother patricia ( maria perschy ) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father 's death . to top it off , her sister ( maria kosti ) is a slutty semi pro golfer named ( gasp ! ) debbie gibson . there 's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time . two maids ( a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone ) , plus udo ( luis induni ) , a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on leila changing clothes , takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit . oh yeah and borg , the pet german shepherd . paul naschy is father adrian dunning , the doubting priest ( zzzzz ) who starts snooping around after john and richard both have their heads twisted around backwards . leila tells him `` they say i am perverse and i 'm going to prove it is true ! '' during her birthday party , she tells her guests `` you make me sick ! i hate you all ! '' and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches `` i do n't want to see that fat ass ! '' debbie suggests they commit leila to a `` sanitory , '' but leila runs off and joins the cult again . she is rescued ( again ) and brought back home ( for the third time ) . by this point in the movie , there 's only about ten minutes left to go and all we 've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how leila is acting weird . it 's almost as agonizing to sit through as an andy milligan movie , minus the gore and laughs . but finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an exorcist-like possession flick . unfortunately , the best part of it are the contact lenses leila gets to wear . some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms , legs and face , she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles . she begins reeking of rotted flesh , spits up some clear gunk , starts speaking in her dead dad 's voice , sneaks into her mom 's bedroom , slaps her around a bit and calls her a `` filthy bitch of a whore . '' in comes father adrian , who now finally believes she is indeed possessed , fends off her attempts at seduction , hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses leila with holy water . doors open and close , a mirror breaks , there 's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor . after she tackles dunning and the two roll down the stairs , the spirit is out of her and into - guess who ? why , borg the family pooch ! the demon dog then turns on adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker . then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film . it 's leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self . but then there 's another time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body . it 's so badly done , you really have no clue what to make of it , which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they 've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless pos . screw the contacts , 1 out of 10 it is .
i picked up this movie for $ 5 dollars at a discount book store , adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie , well , it was n't . there was absolutely no story line at all , bad jokes , and the other comedian said `` the f-word '' every other word he said , cursing usually dose n't bother me but this was over the top . and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie , it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions . and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie . in my opinion , do n't buy this movie , its a waste of money
honestly , where can i begin ! this was a low budget , horribly acted film , it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was ! the sword fighting scenes were n't even sword fights , they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal-mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling ! ! me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day , so we decided to go to the store and look for one , and there it was the sawtooth island movie . i mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home i practically died after the first scene . oh and the plot of the film , the story board , the script , etc .. was a bunch of garbage that i do n't even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it ! ! but if you happen to stumble upon this movie .. do not get it ! ! ! ! !
this film reminded me so much of `` a history of violence '' which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence . dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble . do n't these men have a job ? anyway , dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone , feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap . funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it . sam peckinpah who made the `` wild bunch '' which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared . but it was done with style , and you believed it . straw dogs is not believable . first of all the location is wrong and does not work . why place it in england ? i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930 's or something . second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife . sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one .
where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of neil labute 's latest attempt at film making ? there are many kinds of film fans out there , but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr. intriguing . you know mr. intriguing , do n't you ? he 's the fellow that no matter how stupid , lame , and incomprehensibly dull a film is , he says `` gee , i do n't know why everyone hated it , i found it intriguing . '' he 's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing . especially when he smears it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to greek mythology . he 's also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for . no one else could stand it .
this third darkman was definitely better than the second one , but still far worse than the original movie . what made this one better than d2 was the fact that the bad guy had been changed and durant was not brought back again . furthermore there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the bad guy 's family and darkman himself . this made my heart soften and i gave this flick as much as 4/10 , i.e . * * / * * * * * .
christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun , because he just ca n't let go of the concept . the play , `` sister mary ignatius explains it all for you , '' was presented -- at least in hollywood -- in precisely the same tone as diane keaton 's lecture scenes here . sister mary was an exaggeration , a lampoon , a bitter satire of a serenely confident , doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun -- and as played by lynn redgrave , she was hilarious . but the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously -- while , as mentioned , maintaining the same tone in the `` explains it all '' scenes . the two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes , the movie goes off the track , plunges into the gorge , and explodes . there are no survivors . it could have worked , if the tone of the scenes with the four former students , and their encounter with sister mary , been pitched the same as the sister mary scenes . or if the sister mary scenes been presented more realistically . this way simply does n't work at all .
just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better `` murder , she wrote '' , it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years . i 'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do , or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show . van dyke , who only had a decent career in the 1960s , never was much of an actor at all ( by his own admission ) and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 . he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking . his talentless real life son barry , a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that did n't involve his father , plays his son in the series .
really bad . why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery . i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved `` a christmas story . '' the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer 's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level . charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters . for another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just does n't flow well . everything seems tired and forced . the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end . i would n't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed `` a christmas story . '' it 's that bad . 1/10 .
like most of the festivals entries hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution . although impressive for it 's obvious low budget the film falters in it 's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it 's drawn out and obvious conclusion . the film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died . they kidnap people , drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement . there 's some nice darkly humorous performances from mckellhar and firgens and the rest are just so-so . the film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter . but for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment . the next half is n't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap . it 's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative . too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level . * * /5
in the opening scene of `` malta story '' mr a.guinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be `` certain women need striking regularly - like gongs '' or some such world - weary bon mot.unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life.indeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.mr j.hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a `` jack hawkins '' performance without an ounce of individuality.it could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war movies.many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose . the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its knees.the courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george cross.a worthy subject you might think for a movie , but `` malta story '' does not even qualify for the term `` worthy '' in its most patronising sense.it gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline , perhaps before the actors lost the will to live .
an uninspired and undistinguished `` new '' columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew 's wedding , only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night . columbo investigates ... and that it is about it : indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script , given that it is written by robert van scoyk , who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story `` murder under glass '' in the detective 's heyday ; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding , which include everybody who was there ! devoid of every columbo trait possible , i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues . an insult to the history of the series , with appropriately soap-opera style acting . very avoidable stuff .
this movie down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd , grinding gears all the way to the sappy , b-movie finish-line . the con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie . that is worth seeing . the scene with harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast , you may miss it . definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by robert osborne in his tcm intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion . there is no real conflict , and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character , al . i wonder if he 's got a job for me in cincinnati ?
i recently bought the dvd , forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of `` a chorus line . '' every change the director attenborough made to the story failed . by making the director-cassie relationship so prominent , the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the window . some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed . the show 's hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie 's character . the overall staging is very self-conscious . the only reason i give it a 2 , is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film 's attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it .
this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like , but i did n't . it seemed to be trying way too hard to be 'artsy ' . all flash , with no content . it has some beautiful scenes , and any one of them are nice to watch , but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it . i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton , and the fact that i 'm a big shakespeare fan , but i was very disappointed . i just found it a bit pretentious and , at times , boring .
i was one of those `` few americans '' that grew up with all of gerry andersen 's marvelous creations . thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action/adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it . i expected it to be a romp , but i did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . like lost in space , this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . it should have focused on more action/adventure and the goal of the original series ... saving people in trouble . instead , it focused on alan saving the day instead of his brothers ( who were cast too young anyway vs. the original ) . the breakout part was lady penelope and parker . i did n't care too much for the characters in the original , but i was grateful for them in the movie . they stole the show ! i always enjoyed thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories , and even that did not get enough screen time as far as i was concerned . i would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets . but then , i 'm just a big kid ... ; )
spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... i would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a 1/10 . where to begin , we 'll start from the top ... the story : do n't believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars , and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are . it 's a draub , basic , go to cabin movie with no intensity or `` effort '' . the screenplay : i usually give credit to indie screenwriters , it 's hard work when you are starting out ... but this is crap . the story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie . the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of `` woah , you totally freaked me out '' and `` i was wondering if you 'd uh ... if you 'd like to .. uh , would you come to the cabin with me ? '' . it makes me want to rip out all my hair , one strand at a time and feed it to myself . the characters : holy crap ! ! ! ! some have described the characters as flat , i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch .. they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwards ... the actors : worse than the characters are the actors . they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting . the `` woah you totally freaked me out '' was said so monotone and slow - like it was dumbed down . i could complain for hours on the actors alone . technical : lighting : an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie . too shadowy in areas , too bleached in others . the director should n't use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly . baby steps ! sound : how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie ? 9 . with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured . there is one scene in particular that really sticks out , these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle .... weak ! camera : learn to use it . anyway , i 'm running out of complaining space ..... rent it - i dare you ... rent it and learn from it ... give it a 1 rating .. it deserves it . signing off ... amanda christmas
the week before i saw iowa , i saw art school confidential , in which a pretentious student makes a film and ca n't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation . iowa could be the film that he made . i can see elements of much better movies in iowa - spun and natural born killers . however , in addition to artiness , both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines . iowa . this movie stumbles to a preposterous end . i have to admit that it had consistency . this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part . the actors all did what they could . roseanna arquette deserves better . she demonstrates that she is very talented , very funny , and very sexy . but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball .
if this could be rated a 0 , it would be . from the atrocious wooden acting to the dull , plodding pace , the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers , this is a disaster of a film . the plot is predictable , as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence . from a boring , unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending , every single presence in this film is wasted , and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered . if you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation , watch one of the ilsa films . at least they 're unapologetic and up-front about what they 're trying to do . how something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes . it 's not scary , it 's not interesting , and above all it 's not arousing in any sense of the word . it is , in my opinion , a crime ; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence , and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers . not even elvira 's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is . avoid it at all costs .
this movie was awesome ! ! ( not quite as good as the leif garrett masterpiece longshot ) but still awesome ! ! i thought ashley looked freakin ' huge compared to mary-kate in this film . i wonder why . who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it . dad was kinda a jerk though and mom was a little too chummy with helmit head . i give it 4 . any one who likes this movie shoudl check out longshot .
this is not a film you can really analyse separately from it 's production . the audience became the film-makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the american film industry ; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend . how is it possible to be objective ? this is our movie , is n't it ? or is it ? there may be nothing more disingenuous than a film-maker who promotes himself as the audience 's friend , giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them . just look at that prime self-publicist eli roth , promising gore-hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films , only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like 'hostel ' . david r. ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film , but he was , quite understandably , quick to engage with it . he took the carnival-huckster school of film-making to a new level , getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy . so many have enthused over this interactive , democratic approach to film-making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film-as-marketing . nothing is included that the film-makers know the fans wo n't buy , and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated . the fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know . is n't this just the evolution of the focus group approach ? individual creativity , talent , craft , ideas , all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses . it 's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings do n't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different ? because we happen to be film fans ? well , thank god for us , because otherwise i might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake . so , yes , i had fun at the movie - a midnight showing , fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice-cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film , and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere . like christmas , everyone seemed determined that they would have fun , no matter what . there was laughter , but i do n't know if it was with the film , or at the film . with a film as calculated as this one , is that even a meaningful distinction ? there are some genuinely good aspects to the film . samuel l. jackson gives a well-judged performance , pure self-parody but with a real sense of pleasure . rachel blanchard and lin shaye are decent in limited roles , and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate . the stock characters are to be expected , but the total lack of suspense is n't . what 's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there 's no creeping menace ? there are several snake-jumps-out moments , but they 're incredibly badly staged . only the annoying british man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat . the demise of the honeymoon couple , for instance , is shamefully botched . most of the actors fail to make an impression ; it 's a shame that a charismatic actress like julianna margulies should seem so tired ( when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller-coaster , she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short ) . there are worse movies , but there are many , many better ; another reviewer on this site compared this film with 'lake placid ' , and it 's as apt a contrast as any i can think of . that film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent , the jokes were funny , the suspense sequences were scary , and it was n't devised by committee . that the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus . i do n't need a post-pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film . this film will , in time , fade to become a mere footnote in film history . if it sets a precedent , however , i 'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time . in all probability , nothing much will come of it . perennial popcorn favourites - 'raiders of the lost ark ' , 'alien ' , 'halloween ' and of course , 'star wars ' - just are n't produced by group-think . in the mean time , i 'll tell you what - i have n't half got a craving for some ingmar bergman .
i ca n't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction . forget the product placement disaster , the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot-holes . this was n't only laughable and but painful to watch . even the action was boring . a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children . what a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we 've had bladerunner , minority report or to a lesser extent dark city ( by the same director ) . this one really belongs in the bottom 100 list . truly awful .
and rent a good horror movie . it 's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and did n't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like `` scream '' and `` scary movie '' . in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written . stupid `` we 're going to the prom '' junk . i wanted to claw my ears off . honestly , `` the hills '' has better dialog . there really was no need to make this movie . leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking `` her ? really ? guy is obsessed with her ? really ? '' all the characters act in stupid ways , including the police . ( cover the place in teams of 2 ! front and back ! not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed . ) the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem . no resistance from victims ( or doors ) . nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back ( or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door ) . the people are like mentally disabled sheep . by the by , if you 're a gore fan , you 'll be disappointed too . all the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done . ( so boo hoo for you ! ) none of the killings is the least bit interesting . most of the time they 've already happened by the time we find out . the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies . `` oh kitty ! you scared me ! i thought you were the killer -- aiieeee ! '' and then at the end when it 's time for the killer to die -- well , let 's just say it 's the easiest and most obvious choice . snore . the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout . it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough . do n't encourage this kind of lazy film-making . ( oh , and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen . no tiara . no bucket of blood . ) so save your money and rent `` carrie '' or `` friday the 13th '' or `` halloween '' or `` scream '' or `` scary movie '' ( any of them ) to get a good scare with some original twists .
as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists . we all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world . but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work . and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new , inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie . the fact that this movie won a couple of bafta 's shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment . i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even worse . this movie is so bad i would n't even bother renting it from the weeklies section . do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth .
when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar , an arab potentate visiting washington , d.c. , his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis . sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state . unknown to her however , the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda . a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen , in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali , or empty quarter . in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero , and virtually zero strategic value , but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government , who are keen to build a military base there , need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler . it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department ; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem . sunny 's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her . a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire , but in fact the film 's satirical content is rather toned down . possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country 's foreign policy ; this was , after all , the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters . ( if the film had been made a couple of years later , in the wake of the iran/contra affair , its tone might have been different ) . the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm . sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty , sweet-natured , naive and not too bright . there is , however , a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone , and you can not automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde . ( actually , that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one ) . goldie tries her best to save this one , but never succeeds . part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed . on the one hand sunny is a sweet , innocent country girl from oregon . on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume . the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl . the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material , and `` protocol '' is simply unfunny . whatever humour exists is tired and strained , relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who , apparently , all lust after western women , particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed . there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties , as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley/ nastassia kinski film `` harem '' , about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman , and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting . the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy , because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day `` mr smith goes to washington '' . sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen 's duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah , but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy . goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies , such as `` cactus flower '' , `` overboard '' and `` '' housesitter '' , but `` protocol '' is not one of them . i have not seen all of her films , but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst . 3/10
i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first . and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable , i can see why it has n't been rebroadcast anytime recently . more specifically , this mini has some serious problems , such as : 1 ) it is terribly miscast . the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters . ali mcgraw ( 45 at the time ) was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 . jan-michael vincent ( 39 at the time ) was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22 . the other henry children , and pamela tudsbury , were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20 's . 2 ) some of the acting was absolutely awful . ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable . i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays . 3 ) the directing was poor . to be fair to ali mcgraw , the bad acting and character development were probably the directing . the portrayal of hitler was way overdone . his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic , sometimes charming , but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel . some of the other characters are done so stereotypically ( berel jastrow ) they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them . 4 ) this mini is very dated . the hokey music , the pretentious narration ( it sounded like a junior high school history film narration ) , and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times . also , too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939 . someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all , because it will come off more as a late 70 's / early 80 's `` take myself too seriously '' prime-time soap drama , rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic . remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done , but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning , memorable , and critically acclaimed production . i do n't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long ( 15 hours ) or longer to do it right , and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public , it would n't fly .
i could n't wait to receive the dvd after hearing so much about the film . what a disappointment ! this became one of the most confusing films i 've ever viewed . there were so many characters introduced , some resembling others , that it became impossible to follow the story line . i could not understand how george clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved , at least in the first half of the movie . my wife and i gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the dvd . i might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim . a co-worker told me that a lot of the movie `` comes together '' in the last minute or less . i was glad i did n't waste another hour , waiting . i gave the dvd away the following day .
although bette davis did a wonderful job as mildred , i felt that the film was n't the best i had seen . at the end of the movie i was left feeling like there was something missing in it . bette davis did a perfect job , though , and she made me hate her and pity her all the while . leslie howard did very good as the lovelorn philip carey , and i so pitied him throughout the movie for being in love with such a horrible dame . it 's such a sad thing when one finds him/herself in love with a bad seed . and especially if it 's someone like philp carey , who is a sensitive person , though pathetic . in the end , the acting was what came through and not the plot . the ending scene was particularly good , but i am not one to give it away . although others may find this movie good , i was one who found it so-so . i should recommend this movie to those who like a bad seed so they can see what may happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person .
come on , what is the deal with this show , power rangers anyways ? i always felt that the show , which was originally brought over from japan in a better form , took what was great in japan , and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history ! there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever . the bad haircuts , bad costumes , earrings , etc , all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots , bulk and skull , to the `` duhs '' , of the main cast , jason , trini , tommy , kimberly , billy and zack , i just want to say one thing : give me a break ! saban brought this from japan , and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago . now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such . all i can say once again is give me a break !
dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti-christ is found by an archaeologist , of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and is n't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body . ( like fallen without the suspense ) of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren , like steven seagal and jean-claude van damme , i try to watch his movies whenever they 're on tv . i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed . this movie is utterly terrible . with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . worst of all is lundgren 's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest ( ! ) all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen ( which was good ) and end of days ( which was bad but better than this ) overall this movie is the worst movie i 've seen from dolph lundgren . it literally has nothing to recommend it . it 's awful and it 's the lowest point in lundgren 's career . and i saw cover-up , the last warrior and masters of the universe . 1/2 * out of 4- ( awful )
i wonder how the actors acted in this movie . annette bening was really herself , half in and half out , was she faking or being natural ? it did n't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film . brian cox acted really well . i almost thought that he had always acted this way , tricky , dishonest , in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene . as for gwyneth paltrow , the question is what she was doing in this film . this film is quite sickening and disgusting . who would pay to see such a crap ?
vincente minelli movies are usually worth your time ; meet me in st louis , the bad and the beautiful . i awaited this movie with great interest . but what a disappointment . some came running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism . sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project . the movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with sinatra and macclane and something disappointing happens . the sequence is intended to be tension-filled but minelli is no hitchcock ; he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he does n't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we do n't particularly care that they get shot . ( especially macclane ) but that 's the only real cinematography in the project . otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours . hell is other people , apparently . there is nothing going on in this movie . the dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after ww2 is handled more deftly in 'the best years of our lives . ' and either of two inge products , 'splendor in the grass ' and 'picnic ' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town , with much more poignance .
ok now , lets see . what was funny in the first movie ? i know , people with funny accents , people falling into the water , silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams . in this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max , no good . a whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons , no good . boatcrash , check . funny comments between the two teams , they tried but failed . also , there are too may personalities they are following in this movie . this film should be about what is happening on the water , not on land . i am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max . no good . all in all , i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts .
if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974 , this is the movie for you . but you 'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins , too ( see my remarks on my girl 1 for the reference ) . indulgent admission : i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance , having just viewed its predecessor . but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother , my girl 2 made me look , with its theme of searching for mother . put another way , anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2 , but relating to a protagonist who asks , like so many adoptees , `` who 's my mama '' ? and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe , i 'll be sure to make my own movie about it . people are listless . movies should not be listless . my girl 2 ( like my girl 1 ) is just ... listless . avoid unless you 're a complete sap who 's comforted by a series of small annoyances .
before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan . in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place . i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much . but this is n't half as good . not even jon could save this film for me . my main problem would be that it simply is n't scary . apart from jon 's character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you could n't care less whether they die or not , especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman . the female vampire simply is n't scary or sexy . rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl , no wonder she is so desperate for blood then . another huge problem is that everything is just `` too bright '' . there is no atmosphere or sense of dread . i know the first vampires being set in new mexico was n't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be . this film has no tension like that . the story is basically the same as before . vampire wants berzier 's cross to be able to walk in daylight . however the story has less cool bits this time . there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire , as in the first film . you really do n't care who or what this one is . there is no army of masters . instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy temple . so there you have it really . lack of scares , lack of atmosphere , lack of interesting story . a real let down for me personally .
i have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what i 've gathered , it will be interesting ( when i finally do read it and i will ) . my comments will be based purely on the film . as soon as i saw the trailer i knew i had to see it and was so excited but when i finally did , i was so disappointed it hurt . this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish . the actors were not well cast ( though robards and pryce are both good actors - just not here ) . the kid actors , it seemed , were merely asked to show up , get in the characters ' clothes , say the lines and make the faces . the set and props were cheap and unrealistic . the direction was surprisingly bad . i was so surprised at the awfulness of it that i had to go online and check who directed it , just to see the kind of work he had done . the editing was cut and paste and the plot ( screenplay ) was just that as well ( even though the author had been involved himself , irony ? ) . the building up of the tension , fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came . i 've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it . what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing . it had so much potential . unfortunately , the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story .
1975 's master of the flying guillotine is an amazing and wonderful film to watch . this is n't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all . it 's because the film is so silly and so over-the-top that it is a camp classic -- bad , but enjoyably bad . the film stars a blind guy who has a frisbee-like device on a chain that chops off people 's heads as he expertly throws this at his foes ! who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier-mache arms or that the guy was blind ! it 's just a ball to watch from start to finish -- and one of my favorite `` bad '' films and great to see with friends . because of this film , i was eager to see the fatal flying guillotines ( 1977 ) , though sadly it turned out not to be a sequel but a bit of a knock-off -- taking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable . sure , it 's silly fun , but it never comes close to master of the flying guillotine in entertainment value . like the original film , there are these weird flying devices that sever heads , but they are quite different -- with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own . there also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what 's occurring in this english-dubbed version , as the plot is completely incomprehensible . however , at the same time , some of the martial arts action is very good . while not up to the high standards of most bruce lee or sonny chiba films , the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot . overall , this is a film that martial arts fans may like ( despite its many , many , many , many shortcomings ) , but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous . but , most importantly , it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying guillotine . too bad .
rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly . griffin dunne , rosanna arquette , illeana douglas , ethan hawke , dennis hopper , christopher walken , and john turturro , all jumped on board , only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke . attaching martin scorsese 's name to this was probably the draw , but the end result is way less than the sum of it 's parts . resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong , each scene seems more contrived than the next . `` search and destroy '' is nothing more than abstract , stylish , self indulgent nonsense , and the entire film is decidedly dull .......... merk
a truly muddled incomprehensible mess . most things in the film look more or less like 1987 , but then there are futuristic things just thrown in , like the policeman 's ray gun . and that car ! the director seemed to be in love with colored lights . the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie , but since there was no cast listing , i do n't know which actress that was . this one is worth missing . grade : f
`` 54 '' is a film based on the infamous `` studio 54 '' of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers . in the film , ryan phillippe is the main character , based on an actual employee of studio from 1977 - 1982 . the film 's problem is that it 's all glitter and style and no substance . it tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like `` boogie nights '' but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe . mike myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner steve rubell . it 's only a slightly comedic role and if this was myers ' best attempts at sliding into drama like lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time , it 's a total failure . `` 54 '' could have been insightful and interesting but instead it 's just another dumb teen flick that is n't entertaining or even remotely engaging . view at your own peril .
i 've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on dvd without reading any reviews about it . so , after 15 minutes of watching i 've noticed that something is wrong with this movie ; it 's terrible ! i mean , in the trailers it looked scary and serious ! i think that eli roth ( mr. director ) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid , the movie would be funny ... ( so stupid , it 's funny ... ? wrong ! ) he should watch and learn from better horror-comedies such as : '' fright night '' , `` the lost boys '' and `` the return of the living dead '' ! those are funny ! `` cabin fever '' is the reason why i registered to www.imdb.com so i can release my thoughts of discontent about it . i 've decided to watch the movie a second time > aaargh ! < and make notes for my partial `` review '' to show how foolish the movie is . `` resident evil '' ( horror ) or `` dude , where 's my car ? '' ( comedy ) i can watch over and over again and still enjoy ! but this ... ! how bad can a script and a director be ? ? ? this bad . here are the awful scenes in chronological order : in the early scenes we see henry , who does n't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead-glazed stare is dead ! the movie does n't explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who like to bite people . and my answer to marcy 's unanswered question ( `` what 's wrong with the woods ? '' ) is `` nothing '' . the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for `` suspense '' . then the `` smartest '' of the 5-pack , bert , almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire . he meets now-infected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the `` f-word '' . bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill. bert : '' do n't make me shoot you ! '' ( he forgets to add : `` ... with my bb gun ! '' ) bert heads back to the cabin but how about that ? he meets marcy and jeff who were having sex , but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk ! marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier ( a moment of clarity for a change ? ) bert does n't mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his bb gun . later , as the five estupidos sit around their campfire , another weirdo shows up with his dog . ( maybe that 's what the warning about the woods is all about ? it 's filled with weirdos ... and their dogs ! ? ) they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis . ( their brains are completely intoxicated ! no wonder why they are all so dumb ! ) this is the last time we 'll see this forgettable character ... alive ! henry shows up at their cabin , ( note : he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin ! ! ! ) looking worse , almost like a zombie , covered in goo ! he says he needs a doctor . but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker . he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition . henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard , seats and windows . the fantastic five come out running , armed with : a bb gun , a knife , a baseball bat ( * huh ? ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods ? ? ? ) , a poker , and a ( insecticide ? ) spray-can , ready to combat the single , unarmed and terribly sick man . ( clever script ! ) bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun , which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth . `` what else am i supposed to do ? '' bert yells in his defense . jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck 's windows instead . henry walks up to the dumb girls who say : `` he 's coming towards us ! '' ( thanks for the info , dumb broads , i can see that ! but i do n't think he wants to do you any harm ! ) marcy sprays in his eyes , making henry yelp ! and our `` hero '' paul touches henry 's arm with a burning log from the campfire , which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin ! ( where has all that wisdom gone ? i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll ! : - ) henry turns into the human torch and runs away , screaming . the following day , bert and jeff head out for a mechanic . and marcy decides to `` go for help '' all by herself , in the woods , as paul stays behind with karen ... does n't that sound idiotic ? marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already `` going for help '' ! i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river ! how did she get a canoe ? does she even know where she 's going ! ? anyway , she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and , like in most horror movies , walks inside the cabin saying : '' hello ? is anyone there ? '' bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her ( and me at first ) . and along comes jeff , as well . how did they get here ! ? did they swim across the river ? ? ? do you see how brainless the script is ! ? deputy winston meets paul at the cabin . he somehow does n't notice the blood on their truck . this happens around 35 minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out . ( before i take my own eyes out ! ... now , that 's funny ! ) if you liked this movie , do yourself a favor and watch `` fright night '' , `` the lost boys '' , or `` the return of the living dead '' . then you 'll see they are more entertaining than this ... thing . even the `` toxic avenger part 2 '' , which is also a lousy film , is way more funnier than `` cabin fever '' .
i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting through most of rankin 's dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it ! i could n't actually make it right to the end , and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs ( about 1/3rd of the audience ) after the ragged plot , woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear . this film is all pose and no art . all style and no substance . it is weighed down by dreadful acting , a genuinely dire script , indifferent cinematography and student-level production values . how it got funded , started , and finished is a mystery to me . i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release . the proper critics would tear it apart . a really bad film . shockingly bad . a really really really poor effort and that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new-born-kitten-gets-dropped-into-a-deep-fat-fryer moment . totally meaningless , utterly lightweight , poorly put together ; this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema .
i mean , really ... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie . it 's stupid , ridiculous and just not funny at all . since i saw the preview i knew it was n't going to be a great movie , i just did n't think it was gon na be that bad ... what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie ? when the actors did n't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny ? . now we find ourselves with movies like this one , borat , little men , scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts ! ! just skip this piece of garbage p.s . ( sorry for my english )
i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast , so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio ( a skateboard chase scene ! ) . jodie foster in her first `` grown-up '' role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess . two hours out of my life that i 'll never get back ! no noteworthy characters , unbelievable storyline , questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all , i could n't have cared less . the story of california teens in the 1970 's , where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots . do n't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie .
this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life . just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history , along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene . i think the transvestite poodles did it for me , or better yet , her talking tongue ... or perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat . decisions , decisions ...
previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm , but it was a severe disappointment . lupe valdez is great , but does n't get enough screen time . frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters , but the script leaves them stranded . the movie revolves around the ego of lee tracy 's character , who is at best a self-centered , physically and verbally abusive jerk . the reactions of `` the public '' are poorly thought-out and unbelievable , making the `` shenanigans '' seem like contrivances of a bad writer . and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for him . the `` stinging one-liners '' mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer , since i did n't even notice that an attempt was being made .
since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movies when i was little , i was curious about its sequel . the little mermaid ( one ) is a classic animated feature with top quality everything , a grand music score , and targets a general audience . in contrast , the little mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children , because it is spontaneous , reflects a child 's self perspective , the music is bouncier and less dramatic , and the ending feels like recess . the little mermaid 2 starts out when baby melody is presented to ariel 's side of the family . abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama , a giant tentacle grabs the baby . i laughed , wait a minute it 's not funny , the baby 's being attacked ! okay , i 'll stop laughing . morgana 's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity , takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly . throughout the feature , melody seems superhuman , which i defend is how most children envision themselves . this quality in melody 's character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights morgana without an inch of fear on her face . like the first movie , melody has a lot of ariel 's problems , except the reverse . queen ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean , whereas king triton restricted ariel from the surface . ariel and melody both rebel against their parent . the music is more emotionally moving in the first . this sequel has a bunch of songs , but not as much orchestral work went into it . it 's great for little ones , because it does n't take an orchestra to impress them . the ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting . the sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water . it 's definitely more targeted at kids , because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away , this ending leaves you thinking , `` it 's time for recess ! '' ultimately , this movie is fun for kids , so we should let them have fun .
why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film ? has he really been that strapped for cash ? the film is n't clear on what it wants to be about , grief ? , exotic places ? , ghosts ? , a vehicle for mr darcy ? it 's a muddled , muddy mess . there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good , in itself , and that italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland . there are pointless episodes on the beach , in churches , on busy roads - but what it is all about , or why anybody should care simply is n't clear . there was also a yank woman in the film . it was n't clear what here job was , but she seemed only to be there to make vapid , inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl . was it supposed to be about paedophillia ? ? a pretty dreadful mess , all in all . i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it does n't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film .
the biggest mystery of veronica mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen . rather , the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air . this week marked a nadir for veronica mars : it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 ( soon to be big 5 ) . yes , you read right . veronica mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct wb and every show on upn . it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc , cbs and nbc . now , the hip hypesters are going to say : but this was a re-run . but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re-run ! it boggles the mind why cw would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from upn . clearly something is going on behind the scenes . favors are being exchanged and influence peddled . sorry to be so cynical , but what other explanation is there ? the `` veronica mars has potential '' line is clearly dead now that it 's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so . maybe it 's joel silver 's influence and clout , but frankly , i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching . a great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for cw .
i simply can not believe the number of people comparing this favourably with the first film . it moved me to leave this comment ! this is just an obvious attempt to cash-in on the success of the first film . the dialogue is appalling and nothing like as authentic or compelling as the original film . the storyline is ridiculous , the portrayal of the french police laughable and the characterisation of doyle a mile away from the first film . how many drug bosses do you think go down to the docks in person to see a shipment come in ? the ease at which doyle finds his guy is just pathetic . like all the french police were just drinking coffee until doyle turns up from america and does some real police work . what a joke . try going to a foreign city and unearthing the biggest crims in the place with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets . pathetic . a truly awful sequel , anyone who thinks otherwise is crazy .
i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice entertainment.once i realized i would not be getting that , i watched it for a pretty well made movie ( in terms of filming , and yeah .. that was it ) .but aside from it having a good film quality , considering i had been watching grainy movies all day long , there was nothing good about that movie . he killed 42.why were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and scully ? serisouly , who can answer that for me ? who can answer anything awful about this movie for me . i agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff.that 's all it seemed to be . poor mr.carroll.i 'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales .
being a ni supporter , it 's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists . characters who are hard to root for , typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages , and a predictable 'poetic justice ' ending makes this an awkward watch ...
i 've read some of the other comments and i do have to agree with the ones that did n't get the ending . i thought it was going rather well .. until the end . it kept your mind running and then splat . i have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess . it 's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised . first they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about area 51 ( which makes you think about aliens ) then after they it went to crap . i thought the actors and actresses did fine it 's just the script went sour . anyways , if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end .
this is an atrocious movie . two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man . there 's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a `` spoiler '' . i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick . much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously , all the while grinning psychotically at the camera . add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again , including a vaudevillian song about `` dear old dad '' that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees . the music is annoying at first , then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen . the theme here is of youth run amok , understandable as a reaction to the '60s , but done with little imagination or style . avoid it !
it was n't notable enough to be truly horrible , it was just incredibly lame . the story was not half bad , but the execution was just horrendous . to start with , it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on . it was just paced badly . the dialog was so utterly un-sparkling , just flat and boring . and the characters , cripes almightly , they made deadpool boring . how the hell do you make deadpool boring ? he was n't even funny . he was n't crazy . he was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly . gambit was boring . and since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around , or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air ? and what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves ? i mean , we know they are mutants , but they still exist within the realm of physics . a round bo staff is not a helicopter blade , you can not fly by twirling super-duper fast . which gambit would n't be able to do anyway . nor deadpool , especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography . and this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know wth they are doing , and know better than to use it in every . single . shot . as a replacement for real fight choreography . three of the most physical fighters in marvel comics ( logan , creed , and wilson ) , and some of the worst fight choreography i have ever seen in recent film memory . it was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys . and then you had the break out , with all these mutants who did nothing . even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers ( nice to see a quicksilver nod ) , did f-all when they got out . only emma-really-lame-for-this-film-frost and cyclops did something . and since when was logan so pretty ? and the stupid , `` the bullet will take his memory away . '' do n't you think xavier and the x-men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they x-rayed him in x1 ? i felt sorry for liev schrieber man , he actually brought in a good sabretooth considering the script . he made one of marvel 's more simple super villains feel real . but he could not save the film from it 's own epic lameness . seriously , this was `` daredevil '' level of suck . decent story , good actors , absolutely horrible execution .
at the beginning of the movie , the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing . however , the story was so very slow and boring . and then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox , which leads to tragic events . we live in the forest , and frequently see foxes . one thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild , and enjoy them from afar . this movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it , in trying to make a wild creature into a pet . i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be . even after the terrible events with the main fox , the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits . does she never learn her lesson ? and there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox , which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie . what a disappointment this movie was . and what a horrible story it tells . the final narrated dialog was so stupid , by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv ! i absolutely hated this movie , and would never recommend it to anyone !
here 's a review for people like me . this movie sucks from beginning to end . i threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la msf2000 . the plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart . the lead falls for a con man and it does n't occur to her that she might get conned ? ? ? ? ? and she 's rich ? ? ? ? and she 's a famous psychologist ? ? ? ? ? come on , people . she enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her ? ? ? that was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers . rain man would have been insulted . i also admit that i despise mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters , war-starters , and fur-wearers . my hatred is so complete that it defies logic . but i 'll give it a shot . that it 's not supposed to sound real is fine . i do n't care . it 's that everyone talks the same . mamet ca n't create characters ; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors . no wonder his actors are so wooden . they 're confused about everyone being the same character . ( however , his later films do improve . )
wait , do n't tell me ... they threw out the movie and kept the out takes . you know , this movie could have been shot in a back alley in new york . the `` gangster bangster '' i guess . gangster rap , designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head . i guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the k-mart hats . `` budget rent-a-horsie '' , it seems , supplied the horsies . the one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words .... i though it was him talking . you know , watching this movie just confirms that , it is n't about the acting anymore ... its about looks and it 's about the money . could n't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned . well , all in all , i think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made . just one more thing though , where was ice t ? did he finally get to go on oprah ?
i heard many stories about this film being great ... well , i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month . i watched it , and i have only a few comments about it : 1 ) terrible story-line , 2 ) terrible acting , 3 ) bad fighting-scenes ... i never seen any worse movie in my life so far ! ! when the storyline is bad , than at least make the fights something more interesting . but both are done ridiculously bad ... * the only positive thing about this movie ( in my opinion ) is nikki berwick . god , she looks nice in this movie . that 's about it ...
when i was a kid in the 50 's and 60 's anything connected with disney was by definition great . what happened ? they are able to get any actors and actresses they want , the best of their time . but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant resources . disney can afford the best writers , the best producers and directors , but still ... they screw things up ! this movie is crap . the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or bad . it is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a 3 of 10 .
way back in 1967 , a certain director had no idea about a galaxy , far away or near . he was trying to complete a movie with the title thx etc . this short is a remanufactured history of a certain george . i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it . this is merely an advertising promo for the director , actors , et . al . it has little intrinsic artistic value . it is a brochure . the lead playing george , is very fine , as is the leia character , and the ersatz darth character . all else is plain commercial dross . what a waste . still , it got the job done i guess . the rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time i guess . a brochure only .
worst bob hope comedy ever ( and that includes some heavy competition ) . hope , on an island with sailors , dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl `` steering his ship '' . somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff , as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still ca n't work up any laughs or excitement . where 's bing crosby when you really need him ?
i first read `` lorna doone '' about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it ! it is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days ' journey from london and law and order was much harder to enforce . sadly , this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion . the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful . why do television adaptations do this ? why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story ? ? ? one of life 's great mysteries ! ! ! the bbc made an excellent version which was televised at christmas in the early 1990s which i am still trying to track down a copy of ! take my advice , read the book and do n't bother with this paltry version !
movie goers - avoid watching this movie . if you are faint hearted , you might want to commit suicide . if you are a short tempered , you would want to kill the lead performer of the movie . though he does not have any talent in acting , he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw pullers , auto rickshaw drivers , rowdies , thugs and immature and ignorant literates . he proves - you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be successfully . he is the highest paid actor in india . that shows the taste of movie going public in india . 90 % of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies .
oh my god this was so bad ! the story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish . this film takes itself far too seriously ... unless of course they meant to be funny . i saw this last week at the london sci-fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene . i think my favourite was 'should n't you be studying medicine at oopsalof ' ! and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character nicalo 's only line 'we will be together ... it is our destiny . ' i 'm sorry but after the first time , the words lost all meaning . and what was with the apple ? i recommend this as a lesson to americans : you can not animate , so please do n't try . you only embarrass yourselves .
and how it made it into production astounds me . the main character is an obnoxious show off who is n't the least bit funny . i ca n't stand the character at all . he 's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show . this is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years , no joke . the story lines are both poorly written and executed . the jokes are as bad as the ones on disney 's sweet life of zack and cody . i could not dislike this show more , it 's terrible and should be canceled . even the theme song is bad . the title , even worse . it 's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they 're hot stuff when they 're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as humor . johnny test , go away far and fast !
this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie . on one hand the imagery , camera , lighting , cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly `` expensive '' look and feel . even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot . in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all . so 50 % of the dialog consists of `` what the hell was that ? `` , `` what was that ? '' and `` what the hell was that ? `` . in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though . in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was n't ever explained to them . the only reason why skye bennet 's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl did n't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with . that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast could n't even get close to . i mean there 's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this : ben : is this real , huh ? emily : stop it . ben : a mass psychosis , huh ? jon : somebody has to take control of this situation . ben : this situation ca n't be controlled . not by you , not by anybody . emily : not by you either . ben : no got me goosebumps . but not for horror , more for the horrible attempt . in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita . 2 stars for the excellent technical work .
after reading the reviews , it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work . how utterly boring . oh how about the good ol ' days and there was nothing like it . of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other . i grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with dan ' l boone graced the saturday afternoon matinées . this was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing , yapping , farting , giggling , snot monsters like myself or was-self . and it was a movie theatre filler at the time . almost as big as the wizard of oz . imdb insists that every critique contains something about the plot . problem is was that it was rather a template . here goes . randolph scott ( cowboy/hero ) gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people . hooray ! all of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it . that was just about the plot line of every scott , john wayne , roy rogers film ever made . if you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just do n't ask for surprises . one must remember the context of the times . there was no or little tv . none for kids . there was school . there was the great outdoors . there were toy guns . no cyber time . and the steam age had just collapsed . but movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers . even the girls got into it . this movie was the entertainment . and it is just as mindless as anything produced today . it had a purpose originally of being propaganda . but quickly came to be kids movies . our fathers had experienced the real thing . and it would n't be until sam peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities . not until his directorship did anyone die slowly , with great pain and miserably . until peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair . thanks sam . to see a movie had little or no blood , the adults did n't mind . they would n't have tolerated it i think . no guts spraying the shattering plant life . so this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory . gung ho was suitable for kids then . you will see that i assigned a four to this rating . why would i do that ? well . it is a terrible movie . no matter how i love it . i do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood . but it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms . basically gung ho transitted to become a romance novel for children . should people watch it . of course . i am not saying to stay away . realistically however . the plot is simple . the characters shallow ? they are shoals . you can love a bad movie .
when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago , it would have been something quite different for the time . so therefor some people would have found it quite scary , and may well have been impressed with the special effects ? looking at the play in this day and age , it does n't seem to be all that scary anymore , even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired . would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel ? i do n't think so ...... but if you watch this play again , you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel , rushes straight through the red light ! ( maybe that 's how it was in dickens time ) ? you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state . surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting . ( i ca n't help but notice things like that ) i will not take anything away from the acting , both denholm elliott ( signalman ) and bernard lloyd ( the traveller ) gave wonderful performances . i am not at all sure what is going on ...... i mean was the ghost the traveller , or what ? ? ? does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story ? ? ? ( well maybe i am the only one that do n't ) ? ? ? to sum up ..... the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout , with great character . it suffers from not being that scary these days , and a little if not very confusing in places , and has some rather unusual signalling practises .... thanks for reading my review .
john wayne & albert dekker compete for oil rights on indian territory , and for the attention of martha scott in this republic pictures film shot out of utah , usa . an interesting western of sorts due to its characters and its more modern setting , with wayne & dekker playing the old and new factions of the west . it 's based on a story by thomson burtis who co-writes the script along with eleanore griffin and ethel hill . albert rogell directs in the workmanlike way that befits his career . a pretty mundane story is in truth saved by its final third , where thankfully the action picks up and we are treated to something resembling a pulse . the light hearted approach to the romantic strand does n't sit quite right , and a glorious fist fight between the two protagonists is ruined by rogell being unable to disguise the stunt men doing the work . but hey , stunt men deserve their moment of glory always . solid support comes from george 'gabby ' hayes and wayne as usual has much screen charisma , particularly when rattling off his pistol . but in spite of its better than usual republic budget , it remains a film of interest only to 1940s wayne enthusiasts . 4/10
the movie was `` ok '' . not bad , not good , just ok . if there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far . sadly , fast and furious 2 also stunk , but i 'd rather see this than ff2 . : ) if you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk , this will be a `` cute '' movie for you . personally , i 'd wait for hbo or blockbuster .
i caught this film at the edinburgh film festival . i had n't heard much about it ; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller , shot digitally on a very low budget . i was hoping to catch the next big brit-flick . but i have to say , i was severely disappointed . `` this is not a love song '' follows two criminals , who , after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer 's young daughter , become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down . the real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a british film . the camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story , as are the over the top performances , and the appalling use of slow motion , which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video . there are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty , which instead come over as hilarious and over the top ( cue a pathetic , obligatory drug scene , and countless , pointless camera zooms ) . no amount of cliche 's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story . we 've seen this kind of thing many times before , and made a hundred times better , particularly in john boorman 's masterful `` deliverance . '' but while in the latter film , we actually cared about the characters , in this film , i found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible . even this would n't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile , but instead , are merely a collection of stereotypical , inbred-looking countryfolk . again , another offensive , overused cliche ' coming to the fore . surely there are some nice people in the country , filmmakers ? in its defense , `` this is not a love song '' does contain a couple of good , suspenseful moments , but it 's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video , or , at a push , getting a very limited cinema release . it 's not a patch on last year 's low-budget hunted in the hills movie , `` dog soldiers '' . maybe british cinema could actually get kick-started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people .
`` the 40 year old virgin '' exists in a world i do n't understand . a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to `` f * * * off '' and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded . a world where it 's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples ' cars . a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings . a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities . and a world without any funny jokes ! i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie . i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch - not very funny to begin with , and stretched out beyond all rational thought . the chest-waxing scene went on forever . the characters , aside from carell , were totally one-note . and the romantic elements were completely contrived , particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell 's apartment . that was just lame . and i also found the `` aquarius '' sequence totally annoying and excessive . i hated hated hated this movie !
`` memoirs of a geisha '' is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp , drag queen satire than anything to do with real people . the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines , that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty . but other than one breathtaking dance , the rest of the movie degenerates into `` pretty baby '' in storyville territory , or at least vashti and esther in the purim story , as all the women 's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much , much older , drunken boorish men . maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted , and not just to the american louts after world war ii . perhaps it 's the strain of speaking in english , but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in `` house of flying daggers ( shi mian mai fu ) '' and `` hero ( ying xiong ) . '' michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in `` crouching tiger , hidden dragon ( wo hu cang long ) . '' only li gong shows any real life . otherwise , i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles , or even cillian murphy , as in kabuki theater , particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight . the supposed love story has zero chemistry , mostly due to the age differences , and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious `` chairman . '' i remember more emotion in `` portrait of jennie '' as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton . we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions , and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation . the finale has little sense of normality . the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies , with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation , that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography , as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting . as my mind wandered , i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story , which probably would have been more formal , but a lot more emotional .
i do n't usually comment , but there are things that need to be said . where to start ... the acting , on jeremy london 's part was horrible ! i did n't think he could be so bad . the plot could have been good , had it been well directed , along with a good solid performance from the lead actor . unfortunately , this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining , but get disappointed from the start . well , at least i got good laughs . i would n't waste my time if i were you .
i saw this movie way back when it premiered . it was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands . then suddenly these children , many of whom were n't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out ( they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances ) , but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard , began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons , sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy , left and right . this whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder , opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see ' , then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator , a fold would fall down , revealing another different picture . so while the child may have seen a dog , the moderator saw something like a boat . every time , every bloomin ' time , the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed , never what the child was shown . so who was doing the typing ? never the child . this movie further took a disastrous turn with , as the australia poster stated , the person who molested the child in the movie was in the situation trying to help the child . had melissa gilbert never put her son in that place , he would n't have been molested , is what the movie says . he was better off under her supervision . if i turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead , do you think i 'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that ? not likely ! i think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out , that this movie was based on , they never accused someone within their operation as took place here . unfortunately , i do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from gilbert as the mother of an autistic , but other than that , the movie really did n't do much . the worst by far was the child typing at the end to patty duke , and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed , . . . . . `` we won ! '' this child was molested . if you cut my leg off and i take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me , assault , whatever , then that is legal justice , but it does n't bring my leg back . at best , in my condition , i will view it as a hollow victory . whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation . a 'normal ' child has enough to contend with from such an experience . it 's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won ' if that person is found guilty in court . just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here .
marie dressler carries this depression-era drama about a kindly bank owner , which recently aired on tcm during their april fools comedy month . if you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the dressler-polly moran team , you 'll be disappointed , as this is really a very downbeat film . it 's also very poorly made , surprisingly so considering it came from mgm . leonard smith 's bare bones cinematography is strictly from the 'set up the camera and do n't move it ' school , frequently to the detriment of the cast , who find themselves delivering lines off screen ( it 's like a pan and scan print before such existed ! ) or having their heads cut off . the film does n't even have a credited director , underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production . overall , it 's an unsatisfying mess , with dressler frequently over-emoting and only that bizarre , final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart .
if the only sex you 've ever had is with a farm animal , then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading . this is by far one of the most boring movies i 've had the pleasure to try and watch lately . i found the dvd lying around at my friend 's house , and i made the sad mistake of not burning it . i am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie . just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span . i think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie , but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere .
at one point , violet ( lucy liu ) tells neil ( cillian murphy ) that why she constantly seeks out for an adventure . she said `` because i 'm bore-phobic '' . it mean that she ca n't really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities . well , i think her reason and the way this film go is very ironic . because `` watching the detectives '' is a cheer boredom . have any of these characters actually doing something exciting for once ? neil is a geek who runs his own very small video rental shop . he and his other geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watching movies together while debating about them afterward . but neil 's life is completely turned around when violet walks into his store . she 's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him . anyway , after some dates , they decide to see each other . the problem is violet is a person who keep doing prank jokes on neil and ca n't really doing something normal , whereas neil is completely opposite to hers . the question is . is they are going to be in love at the end ? you bet . `` watching the detectives '' is a cliché romantic-comedy to its core . and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else . from the first couple of set-up , we know that neil is pretty laid-back guy who did n't really commit to anything . and then , violet enters the scene , looking all weird and annoying . so at this point , we all know that we 're going to sit though all meaningless situations to find out how they 're going to end up in the end . is it worth waiting for ? i would say no . as i said , they tried to give something more for the audience . `` watching the detectives '' is trying to talk about commitment . to observe how far people go to reach for something they desire . we knew in the end that insane things that violet has done is all the test how far neil is ready to go to win her heart ( or whatever ) . well , i think it is completely bullshit . this movie will end pretty quick if neil just said to himself `` forget about it , that girl is one of a nutjob ! '' after collaborating with many great directors recently ( danny boyle 's `` sunshine '' and `` 28 days later '' , ken loach 's `` the wind that shakes the barley '' and neil jordan 's `` breakfast on pluto '' to name a few ) , it 's pretty weird choice for cillian murphy to make a movie with one of broken lizard comedy troop , paul soter . by all means , he 's not bad ( as usual ) , but such a talent actor like him should n't be wasting his time in the movie like this . on the other hand , lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet . her acting is a mess . i mean it 's all over the place and so over-the-top . tony montana would have been proud . the last but not least mistake that movie made is a completely irrelevant title . you simply ca n't really connect a dot between the plot and its title ; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all . in short , `` watching the detectives '' is pleasant if forgettable motion picture that you might have a chance to catch it on cable tv so quick that you could n't imagine . bloodymonday rating : 1.5/4
well , i saw this movie yesterday and it 's - unfortunately - worse than you could think . first of all the plot is idiotic , it has no sense at all . the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues . the audience was laughing many times . and the suspense is very low . actors play so-so , with an exception of sharon stone , who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments . the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like `` i want to * beep * you `` and it looks like , let 's say it gently , a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all . that erotic tension from bi1 is totally gone . from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to dvd , but on a far lower lever than the original movie . for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly . the director of basic instinct 2 is no paul verhoeven and it shows . the new composer is no jerry goldsmith and its shows . the script is done by people who are no match for joe eszterhas . there 's no substitute for michael douglas in it . the film looks cheap and badly edited at times . i 'm sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was : `` why heave n't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie ? '' all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this . the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema . it was provoking , sexy and controversial . it had the best sharon stone 's performance in her career . it had this specific paul verhoeven 's style . unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie , badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories . it 's a pity that they made this film .
you can be fooled by your first impressions . as in , initial reactions to a movie , for example . as in , the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it ( first of all , i love black comedies ) . could even - despite being male , myself - empathise with the feisty girls ' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay . was tripped up by my own face-value ( and , i do mean `` face-value '' ) response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture . it just goes to show you that you 've got ta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it 's bad ( and not `` bad good , '' either ) : the reason i 'm giving this movie a `` 4 '' rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams ( the rest of 'er is pretty good , too ) ; but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics - which means you 'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen . the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i 'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me ; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it . i do n't think it 's a total waste of time , but ....
wow , this was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments this movie has no plot , no character development , they possibly had some kind of script but it 's difficult to tell based on the actual end result . the editing of this movie was really non-existent , it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening . all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all , has bad acting , bad dialogue , bad everything . the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor , i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this . unless you are ( like me ) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find , do not watch this . period .
after eight moto films the series had run its course , as this last entry demonstrates . peter lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of moto , and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a `` funny '' british sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here .
in a movie that follows a struggling actor , played , evidently , by a struggling actor , this does no favours for chris klein . he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display , what could only be described as , a bland leading man . the story exists , but that is all , and fails to show any basic start , middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened . one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst , who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life . whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i ' l be watching out for him in future .
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of : he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him . the main subject of this bullock vehicle , all the ideas , almost everything was already in hitchcock 's classic `` rope '' : the two students who commit a gratuitous crime , nietsche 's philosophy , and the clues that the boys disseminate , the master was the first to transfer them to the screen.and with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force . `` murder by numbers `` does not take place in a single room , like `` the rope '' , mind you.and , what a supreme originality , it pits two cops against the evil youngsters ; and , you would never guess it , these two cops are very different : actually , bullock plays the part of woman living like a man , and her partner ( chaplin ) is as shy as a clueless girlie.the two boys ' performances are not really mind-boggling , not as good , as , say , that of edward norton in `` primal fear '' . well , you know , '' rope '' was so good ....
pros : nothing cons : everything plot summary : a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies . review : never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles . filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks , tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame , forgetable actors whom could n't act to save their lives and gore that 's more gross than frightening . how does a movie like this even get made ? simply put , avoid tzc like a sexually-transmitted disease . my last 2 cents : humorously enough , this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films . they 're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this . my rating : 1 out of 10 ( if it were up to me , this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion )
considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign , i would have expected something to be worth the fuzz ... from the opening scene on ( in which the two brothers `` sensually '' caress each other , laying naked in a bed ) it goes rapidly downwards ... nothing to get the attention , not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot , baaad baad acting ( a few minor exceptions , but artificiality is at its best ) . incest and lesbianism are promising themes , but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers , saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious , unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing ... ) . the too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene ... at this point , that could have saved some of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is . many other things could be said ... but please watch the movie yourselves ... i am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1/2h of their lives ... like i did : (
i have not yet decided whether this will replace anaconda as `` the worst film i have ever seen '' . even if you ignore the dodgy accents , low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it . i only went to see it as i had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film . the simple answer is - they did n't . characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative . even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it 's climax you do n't care what happens to any of them . i can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from . but after my friends and i came out of the cinema i had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened . they even change the true meaning of the books title `` rancid aluminium '' by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title . a real mess of a film from start to finish .
as others have noted , this should have been an excellent hammer-style film , and it seems to me that that 's how most of the actors were instructed to play it ... but the screenplay is so leaden , poorly paced , and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies ( poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them ) that it 's all too overblown and self-important . this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton , although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr. rock finally realizes what he 's done . the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight . freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer , but he was a lousy director .
i just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this ? the profit ? and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap ? this movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults do n't try to watch it . thats the reason i think hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema , be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola 's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater , my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building.the sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art.the only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list.i am giving 2 stars for supporting the india 's cinema efforts but for nothing more or less ..
i could n't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all . with the worst actors you could find , the worst script written ( mark frost & sollace mitchell ) and by far the worst waste of time in viewing . i wo n't belabor the story as it 's really not worth it . but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story . as to the story , it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did . that in reality the wife could n't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing . that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all . that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up . and the final result of the film is an insult to justice , movie codes , and the male species . the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish , kill whom they want , defend the killer and get away with it , while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim . hard to believe that sollace mitchell , the director and a man , would even want to make this dribble . as to the acting : jordan ladd , the killer , is awful . a loony toons , who does needlepoint during her murder trial ( is this allowed in court ? ) she bored me to the hilt . one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i 'd throw up . she 's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife . the husband , played on one level by vincent spano , just seems to look and act stupid most of the time . he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him . the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney . she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice . if she would cross examine me anytime , i 'd have told her to go take a hike . everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so . i wish i could give this film a zero rating . however we are forced to start with 1 . too bad . let 's not have anymore painful watching films like this . lifetime can do better then this , i know it . this is a postscript : made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake . as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i 'd seen it before and did n't like it or her . i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick . doese n't anyone see that her/his message is that sickness pays . being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director/writer . totally making the male species idiots . well , this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful . we 're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie , which in this person 's mind deserves to be trashed . and again this loser is shown . why ? ? ? ? ca n't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie ? are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again ? get her off tv , films and out of sight . she 's just terrible in every sense of the word . phew ! ! ! !
everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts . oh . i laughed a coupe of times , but i laughed a couple of times during schindler 's list also . they really screwed up a good premise .
this film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957 . it was based on a novel which was later turned into a play -- which flopped on broadway . the story is about some navy officers on leave in san francisco during wwii . they have 4 day 's leave which they spend at the mark hopkins hotel . the film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real . cary grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama -- but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he does n't really pull it off . tony curtis or james garner would have been better choices . audrey hepburn was initially set to play opposite grant , but had other commitments -- so suzy parker stepped in . she had never acted before , but was america 's top photographic model at the time . i think that she did a good job , considering all the pressure that she was under . grant 's pairing with jayne mansfield in a few brief scenes -- did not really work . the studio was trying to give her some class by acting with grant -- but the character had no substance at all .
certainly not horrible , but definitely not good . cry , the beloved country ( 1995 ) was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood ( adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton ) . starring james earl jones and richard harris . the film is about pre-apartheid south africa , and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining . the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo ( james earl jones ) receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately ; he later finds that his son has killed a man . the rich farmer/landowner james jarvis ( richard harris ) finds that his son , a fighter for black rights , was the one killed by kumalo 's son . in this they connect . i can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name , for i have not seen it . or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it ; both look better than this one . but cry freedom , on the other hand , i have seen ; it has a much more urgent air to it , like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry , the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going . very `` wishy-washy '' . i refuse to compare the film to the novel ( except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film ) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means . frankly , this movie blew . well , i guess it was n't that bad , -- five-out-of-ten , -- but it was n't that good either . both of the leads , both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history ( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter , ronald harwood , who is also oddly off is game with this film , having also written the sublime the pianist , and being julia ) . among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time ; there is little , if any , tension with any moment of the film , racially or suspensefully . the music does n't help . the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film . one upside is the cinematography , with many rather good or great shots , but unfortunately , this does not help the film too much . the last , striking words of alan paton 's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film . it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown . i do n't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film . thanks for your time .
remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that does n't quite meet those same feelings as an adult ? that occurred to me when i went back to school .. the national lampoon 's class reunion . the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs , but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth , a man who appears to be a vampire , and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head . you have the class president who believes he 's the best thing since sliced bread ( but as we see in the film , he 's a coward and joke ) , a couple of pot smokers who do n't even know they are at their own class reunion , and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed ( and no one can seem to remember his name .. this is the one running joke i enjoyed ) . there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places , a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog , and the cook ( you know her from `` goonies '' and `` throw mama from the train '' ) who loves to place food on people 's plates with her hands ! the film is essentially about a nutcase who is ( or at least attempting to ) taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him ( they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister ! ) . the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened , trashed hallways of the old high school . they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself . the film has a few good gags that work ( pretty much early on ) , but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute . the film 's true problem is that it really does n't know where to go . the film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction .. if it really has any direction at all . the cast is enthusiastic enough , but the material they are to make funny just does n't have the quality to hold any interest . it 's a curio for fans of early 80 's comedy relics that are forgotten ( this one rightfully so ) .
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing . the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go . you should n't really decide to watch this based on my review or not . i saw so little of it i should n't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it . could n't they have just made earnest does dallas ?
wow ! i watched the trailer for this one and though 'nah , this one is not for me ' . i watched my husband and our friend 's faces during the trailer , and knew this was a 'boy movie ' . i mean , hallo ! a bunch of chick barmaids that dance - another striptease ? then , i started watching it , it did n't look all that bad . so i carried on watching . i watched it right to the end . what an awesome movie . if anything , this is a chick-flick . these girls have attitude . it is really a feel-good movie , and a bit of a love story . really leaves you with a nice feeling . basically , the story of a small-town girl making it big in the city , after going through the usual big-city c * * p. there have been a couple of these , it is almost a new urban legend . but it also makes you think of your life , and what you have achieved . well , me anyway . i think it is because the whole working in a bar scenario is very familiar , not just for me , but for many people i know . do n't trust the trailers for this one - it is aimed at bringing the men in .
if you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book , please do n't give up on the series . i bought my first copy of any of the books in may of this year , and already i 'm almost finished with book 10 . i dare say the movie is a piece of trash that does n't do the series even a sniff of justice . while `` left behind : the movie '' only vaguely follows the story of the `` left behind '' ( the book ) , the characters are n't even close to accurate . a few examples : rayford never acts on his feelings for hattie ( he is about to when he 's informed of the vanishings ) ; buck williams is a blonde haired , magazine writer , not a tv reporter ; chloe is at stanford , and a lot of the book details rayford wondering if she 'survived ' ; buck and chloe do n't meet until much later , at a meeting in new york , set up by hattie ; irene and raymie are never 'in the book , ' rather just in rayford 's flashback thoughts ; the roads are so jam packed with wrecks following the rapture that rayford and hattie have to helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc , etc , etc ... and that 's just from the first movie ; they 're about to release the third . please , even if you did n't like the movies , give the book series a chance .
fiction film ( it lists as based on a story though it does have a `` documented by '' credit ) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of canada to try and find a bigfoot . ( they want to capture one and then attach a tracking device ) . its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness . there are some attempts at creating tension and scares , but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the wilds . this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film , it promises you so much , a look at bigfoot , but in reality it delivers very little . recommended for insomniacs only
i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year , but perhaps he should insist on quality , not quantity . i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in `` along came polly . '' stiller 's reuben is grating , charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year . stiller 's schtick is getting tiresome . he undoubtedly has comic talent , but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break , find some material that is actually funny . because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad . there 's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston , which is a shame because she 's a good , smart actress with a promising career . as long as she keeps making more movies such as `` the good girl '' ( in which she 's terrific ) and less like `` along came polly , '' she 'll have a career of which she could be proud . aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she 's working , but it 's a daunting task for any actress . with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin , as reuben 's boss stan , and philip seymour hoffman , as reuben 's best friend sandy , there 's nothing funny in this awful film . other supporting characters , including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude , are annoying . azaria 's accent is not only stupid , it 's terribly unfunny . the premise of `` along came polly '' certainly showed promise . unfortunately , it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy , instead of this lame , dull , boring excuse for a comedy .
i considered myself to be quite melancholy , especially when i watch a great touching and tear-jerking movies . but not for this one ( which surprised me ! ) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly . there are several disturbing facts throughout the movies : 1 . despite guilt-ridden ben 's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past , i find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action . some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly , in the end this was a disturbing action to me . 2 . the movie story line is over-dramatized , but the logic is over-simplified . medically , blood type match is required to be an organ donor . toward the end of the film we learnt that emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period . nevertheless , it seemed that ben had the rare blood type , same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently , despite the rarity of ben 's blood type , he was able to donate not only his heart , but also his kidney , his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen . 3 . why the doctors allow ben 's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself ? i might be over-analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie . however , some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie . if you go for a soap-opera type of film , go for it . but it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment , give this one a miss !
this is the movie that epitomizes the d & d fear of the 80s ( and even today ) . the fear being that people who play d & d ( or any other role-playing game for that matter ) will be `` sucked in '' and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy ( and go on killing sprees , child sacrifices , suicide , etc ) . great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects , but anyone who has played a role-playing game , a video game , or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence . it is to d & d what wargames was to computers . plus as a movie , it just kinda sucks .
an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom . the producer hires some one to go and bring her back . complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking `` god '' who likes to eat naked women . this is a gory sleazy movie . there is copious amounts of nudity and violence , not to mention violence against nude people . its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being , and if the movie was n't so boring this film would be a classic . lets face it , despite the gore , the nasty sex and abuse , and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer . the pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out . there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other , even though its ultimately all one story . worst of all , almost no one says anything . most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that `` i 'll do what i want '' . its such a quiet and dull movie that if it were n't for the frequent screams of the victims i 'd recommend this as a sleep aide . this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep , or unless you need to see every euro-cannibal movie . ( an aside . videoasia just released this as part of their terror tales series . their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a japanese source ( there is fogging ) that was cropped to remove the subtitles . their print also has no opening titles )
i really looked forward to see planet of the apes , but it was a huge dissapointment . the settings and masks are great , but that is the only good aspect of the film . all other things are really annoying . mark wahlberg is not acting , he is just in the movie , looking stupid . the other actors are also not very good . but the worst point of all , is the story . it is absolutely ridiculous ! for example : the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground , but the humans don ` t attack them , no , they wait until they are up again ! this is just one example for the stupid story , but it would take too long to tell them all .
what could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor . fox is ok as nathaniel ayers , the julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the walt disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row . looking for a good story to boost his flagging career , reporter steve lopez { robert `` rehab '' downey } gets to know him and tells his story . taking every element of the classic `` how we hit the skids '' movies , borrowing very liberally from `` a beautiful mind '' , taking the bogus `` feel good '' attitude of films like `` rocky '' -you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie . it is corny , trite , utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments . i hate to say it , but this is the kind of movie that , if you say you hated it , people will give you bad looks . i really wish i could say something positive about this film , but i really ca n't . the acting redeems it somewhat , but not enough for me to give it more than one star . strictly made for tv movie stuff . not worth your time .
the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies . the battle between nature and technology always caught man 's imagination . the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron . the story of `` titanic '' involves two fictional characters ( leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet ) from different backgrounds ( one is a hobo-artist , the other is an aristocrat ) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on . first of all , although using a historical name , this movie had little regard to history . the plot was built around two fictional lovers , french diamond , and treasure hunters . the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background . many historical facts were simply forgotten . where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings ? why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal ? omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy . and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is . the overall plot was rather shallow ; rich equals greed and corruption , poverty equals compassion and heroism . it is very ironic to spend $ 200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts . there was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes . it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil . casting was also very poor . if dicaprio was 2 inches shorter than winslet , you could swear she was his baby-sitter . the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours . first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse . hearing corny pick up lines such as `` i see you '' and `` this is my side of the ship '' generated more pain than the screams of drowning people . also , jokes were too abundant and rather lame . `` titanic '' did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original . the best thing about this film were its special effects , and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award . although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense , the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo ( dicaprio ) , and so the movie became a success . now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture , so it seems that `` titanic '' did achieve something after all .
kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets . with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents . infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole . it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer , but the comedy is scatter shot , its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso . i kept asking `` what am i watching '' . i watched it from start to finish and i still do n't know what the hell happened . its a shame since there are some great action scenes , some amusing jokes and the occasional moment , but nothing , none of it ever comes together , i 'd take a pass .
oh my god . i bought this movie and ... i ... watched ... the ... whole ... thing . . . okay , it 's going to be alright ... i ' l know i 'll be okay in a month or two . some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs . i was going to eat something after the movie but i just ca n't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment . bad ? yes bad . very bad . bad bad bad bad bad . wait , bad does n't seem to get the message across in quite the right way . hmm ... there is n't a word to describe just how awful .... not awful ... hmm disgustingly horribly casted/acted/filmed/directed/written . now i do n't know what to do but throw it out . possibly burn it i would n't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now . the worst movie ever since `` hey happy ''
herculis puaro is , in general , a well established 'hero ' we know well from books and movies . this movie or this story do n't work and i felt its not agatha 's mistake . the cast is n't good , the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures , the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything ( even arab clothes ) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama . the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic . the scenes are , as said before , perfect and looking fake . the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert ? ! the 'victim ' is not likable .
whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i 've ever seen , this movie is always on it . it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing , and i would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again . what 's wrong with it ? let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater . i went to a midnight show , on a saturday night . i the only ones in the theater were myself , and a bunch of loud , boisterous , rather unruly teenagers , sitting somewhere behind me . they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night , and had come to this `` comedy '' for some laughs . before the movie starts , during the previews , they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time . it was borderline annoying ; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie , i might 've said something , but i was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun , so i let it go . and they did settle down once the movie started . why am i telling you all this ? because you can judge this alleged `` comedy '' by the effect it had not just on myself , but on this rowdy bunch . during the entire run of the film , not one person in the theater laughed . not once . not myself , not the boisterous kids . absolute silence , aside from the soundtrack . and when the film was over and the lights came on , we all , all of us , slowly filed out of the theater in slow , somber , absolute silence . it could 've been a funeral . this was the effect that this `` comedy '' produced . not laughter , not enjoyment , but absolute depression . it was a depressing , depressing movie , and not the tiniest bit funny . preachy , self-indulgent , depressing , but not funny . i consider mel brooks ' `` blazing saddles '' to be on the short list for funniest movie ever . it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever . in short : if you 're feeling too happy , give this movie a whirl ; otherwise , do n't say i did n't warn you .
i have a 5 minute rule ( sometimes i 'll leave leway for 10 ) . if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it 's probably not going to ever get better . i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory . dan in real life is definitely no exception . i was watching this turkey and thought ; wow , this is not funny , not touching , not sad , and i do n't like any of the characters at all . the story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters , who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend . i suppose the tagline would be `` advice columnist who could use advice '' ? i do n't know . dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice . i guess that 's the irony ? i do n't know . he goes to see his parents , brothers , sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat , which seems very sweet , and potential fodder for good comedy , story lines ... none which ever emerge . the central story is basically how he loves this woman , but ca n't have her . anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her , but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny , trite , lifetime movie network dialogue `` murderer of love '' to get to the inevitable happy ending . this is truly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
that 's a problem i have with movies that come on television , when there is nothing else to watch . i somehow get sucked into really bad movies . but this one was fairly watchable . the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet , then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh . and that 's why i gave this movie a 2 , instead of 1 . the story was stupid ... but in that way that makes you laugh ( too stupid > funny ) . i think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead . i was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway .
around the late 1970 's , animator don bluth , frustrated with the output his company , disney was churning , defected from the mouse house to form his own studio . his first production , the secret of nimh , was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day . this was followed by an american tail and the land before time , both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful . although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh , they still are very charming , enjoyable features for both children and grown-ups . but before long , don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven ; critics were especially harsh on this film , and matters were n't helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney 's the little mermaid . considering that the movie has such a friendly-sounding title , one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare . instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling , deceit , crime , mistreatment , and murder . that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say , but it does call into question over whether the film is for children . on the other hand , it 's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven . in short , it 's a movie with a major identity crisis . set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans , the movie starts out when charlie b. barkin , a rough-and-tumble german shepherd , is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner , a nasty , cigar-puffing pitbull , carface . before you know it , charlie finds himself in heaven , albeit by default . here a whippet angel , annabelle , tells him that `` all dogs go to heaven because unlike people , dogs are usually loyal and kind . '' this line represents the confused nature of the movie , since the dogs in the movie , the whippet aside , are presented as anything but . upon realizing that he 's been murdered , charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface . with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy , charlie `` rescues '' carface 's prize , annemarie , a human girl who can talk to animals ( in order to predict who will win the rat races ) . charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family , but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down . although he refuses to admit it , charlie does grow to love annemarie ... the concept of the story is n't as problematic as the execution . aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three-quarters through ( with the vocal pipes of ken page ) , none of the other characters emerge as likable , nor frankly , are even worth caring about . unfortunately , that also applies to charlie ; in trying to make him an anti-hero , the script ( composed by more than ten writers ) only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable . as such , the audience feels no empathy for charlie , and worse , his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing . ( further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds . ) besides the lack of an endearing lead , the movie 's other problem is in the structure of the story . the slowly-paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie 's running time . the aforementioned musical alligator ( who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats ) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere , as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel-colored pups pizza . the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft ; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter , impactful story . matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t.j. kuenster ( annemarie 's song and the gator 's ballad are the only good ones ; the latter in particular benefits from ken page 's mellifluous vocal ) or the uneven voice cast . as mentioned , burt reynolds ' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further ( the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end ) . dom deluise as itchy is pretty good , but he 's had better roles , notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh . ken page , as mentioned , is awesome in anything he does , but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best . similarly wasted are loni anderson ( as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie ) , melba moore , and charles nelson reilly . judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable , partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show . barsi aside , the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation . technically , this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth 's team ( by 1980 's standards , that is ) , particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine-demon . if anything , the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling . on the whole , however , i can not recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment . even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion , the overall package is not in the same league as bluth 's better efforts . animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry , but by the time it 's over , all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth .
how good is gwyneth paltrow ! this is the right movie for her ... too bad she 's completely out role . i have n't read the book by jane austen , but i ca n't believe it is so superficial and the characters are n't much more than caricatures . it was n't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book , but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups . i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who did n't overstep the mark of overacting ( a couple of times ) .
a different look at horror . the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting . however from my american perspective this movie just was n't that good . the protagonist , marie played by anastasia hille was n't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her . she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left . also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film . then a long time passed before any real suspense built up . once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else . the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they did n't use sex to make up for a thin plot . all in all i 'd recommend it for renting , but not for theater goers .
how many fricken ' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror 's reflection ? it 's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy , poorly done film . there were only two freaky moments to appreciate .... when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters . speaking of characters , the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz . cup i was drawing it from . the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons . there was the friendly , aged sheriff . there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl . lots ' o'characters with no development . the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning . but rather than explore the child 's murder , which would have been interesting , they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other . when they reach the cabin , the scenes rarely flowed together .... with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there . oh ... and the eerie sounds were also overdone . you know what i mean .... creaking doors that open by themselves , crickets in the forest , yada yada yada . ooooohhhh . have n't seen that before . again , you 'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again . note to director : a scary scene is only scary if it 's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film . think these things out before calling out `` it 's a wrap ! ''
i should n't even review this movie , since it 's not actually a horror movie -- and thus not worthy of dr . cheese 's attention . at least , it 's not horror in the usual sense . it 's certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap . that 's why i turned it off after the first four hours . imagine my surprise , then , when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed . yep , that 's right ; in plain terms , this movie is b-o-r-i-n-g. `` the order '' had lots of flaws , not all of them unique . in particular , it seems to me the main problem with the `` religious '' subgenre of horror films is hollywood 's unwillingness to engage christianity on its own terms . it is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox . just ask william peter blatty . in fact , without orthodoxy , films like this are just an anything-goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers ' ( usually dull and illogical ) imaginations . think about it . if someone made a movie ostensibly about , say , physics , but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong , but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals , you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot . the same goes for these sorts of movies . in other words , `` the order '' ( and many similar movies before it ) invent out of whole cloth stuff about the catholic church and about the christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions . unsurprisingly , the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid . this movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing . avoid this steaming pile .
it 's very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies . they get worse every time . niki and flo ( 2003 ) is a depressing stab at the camera . it 's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g . chicago international film festival ) . this movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money . score : 0.02 out of 10 .
good grief i ca n't even begin to describe how poor this film is . do n't get me wrong , i was n't expecting much to begin with . let 's face it , a pg-13 slasher flick is pre-destined to be missing the ummm ... slashing , so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore . but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away . we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy . and here 's a turnup for the books ... she never changes - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development . if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again . on top of this , we 're handed possibly the least intriguing ( and definitely the least scary ) killer ever to grace the genre . i 'm not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie . finally , because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept ( and apparently thirteen-year-old ) director , what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time ? closets , that 's what . lots and lots of closets : big closets , small closets , mirrored closets , closets to narnia , so many damned closets you 'll not want to dress yourself for another year . in fact this movie should have just been called `` closet '' , and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case . on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert - something to the extent of : `` what the f * @ ! did we just waste our time watching ! ''
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt . even he could n't make this movie enjoyable . the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though . it 's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful . if you took the actual film , dipped it in paint thinner , then watched it , it would be more entertaining . seriously . if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart , back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake .
i am a big movie fan . i like movies of all types . this is arguably the worst movie i 've ever seen . i get that it follows the book closely , which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie . especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once . these characters are not quirky , they are mentally ill . the things that happen are not funny , they are disturbing ; especially considering they are supposed to be true . this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums , another movie i hated , only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny . i will never get those hours back . i wanted to wash my brain after watching .
this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin . the vhs box said it was rated `` r '' but the into on the actual tape inside said it was `` x . '' the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking . even in the dark , you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy - and , yes , you could see his penis in her mouth . i read somewhere that this was the first time where a `` mainline actress '' had done something like this on screen . detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body . she looked beautiful . unfortunately , the movie is ugly .... a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers ' looks .
this movie was terrible . i thought with all the some what decent actors , it would be better . do n't waste your time . eva longoria parker was awful . she should stick to desperate housewives . paul rudd is becoming a b actor . the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i 'm saying . and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons . watch just like heaven with reese witherspoon ... it was a tad better . or any other ghost movie . you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time . ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance ! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it .
i have read all of the love come softly books . knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book , but generally they at least have the main point of the book . i was highly disappointed in this movie . the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy 's father comes to visit , ( although in the book both parents come ) . that is all . the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes , sad , from the book , that i just could n't enjoy it . even if i did n't read the book it was too sad . i do know that pioneer life was rough , but the whole movie was a downer . the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great .
i could not believe how awful this film was ; i rarely watch commercial tv , but thought `` well , diane keaton is always worth watching '' . i stand corrected . everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame . i realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age , but the script to this was so inept , clichéd and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms. keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear . none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable . the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class - i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering `` what were they thinking ? '' . very , very sad that it has come to this . do n't waste your time .
i gave 1 to this film . i ca n't understand how ettore scola , one of the greater directors of italian cinema , made a film like this , so stupid and ridiculous ! all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial , boring and not interesting . too long , too boring . the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann . hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film .
being s club seven , the film already boosts an ecstatic atmosphere ! but seriously , oprah has a point when claiming : `` do n't go there , girl ! '' spice world suddenly does n't seem to be all that bad ... i take my money elsewhere !
while channel surfing , we found this movie with its promising synopsis . we were dismayed at the flat acting , and formulaic storyline . we found amusing the exploding car scenes , unbelievable shoot outs , and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard . what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from `` dante 's peak '' , where the church front falls on the school bus , the store fronts break away from the main street , the overpass collapsing , and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it . it was a good laugh although unintended , and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films .
like freddy 's revenge , this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and does n't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it . basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends . this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor , so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy . i 've not alot to say about this . it 's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four , but not worth watching a movie over . uninspriring and unenjoyable , possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series .
my wife and i found this film to be highly unsatisfying . while the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on , when you leave the theater , there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all . ( spoilers ahead ) christopher plummer , enormously wealthy head of a ny bank has a terrible hidden secret . profiting from ww ii deals with the nazis and hiding loot stolen from jews , he keeps the evidence ( including diamonds and documents with the nazi swastika ) in a safety deposit box in his bank . why ? if he wants this never to be revealed , why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago ? and the diamonds ? obviously , he does not need them - why keep them rather than dispose of them ? how did the bank robbers find out his secret ? how did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box # 232 ? ace detective denzel washington also discovers bank records show sd boxes no 's 231 and 233 , but no # 232 . curious . he meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact . all the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily . wow ! talk about super powers for a detective . the bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened . they take only the contents of sd box # 232 , ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president . this defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind , or for his henchmen with lesser brains . jodie foster , using her political connections with the mayor of nyc , gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages . she offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand , but he ai n't interested . so what 's his point ( if any ? ) . my wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players , christopher plummer ( bank president ) , denzel washington ( ace detective ) , and jodie foster , crack trouble shooter for high-powered problems . the last jodie foster movie i saw , `` flight plan '' , was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all . i thought i liked jodie foster , but i will probably avoid her future films . now my problem is that i can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies . i can not disagree with her on this one ... `` a waste of money , and a waste of time . '' be forewarned . a well crafted film , fine actors , lousy script writing .
another made for tv piece of junk ! this is an insult of a war movie ( i use the word movie in it 's loosest possible form ! ) i thought telly savalas 's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video that 's shown on tarrant on tv on a semi regular basis , but then i 'd forgot he was involved in this ! i 'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory , but cable tv brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me ! ! i like the bit ( laughs sarcastically ! ) in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties , but it 's blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties . also the steam train the commando 's are training on shows the jz ( jugoslavia zeleznice , or yugoslav state railways ) logo 's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly , even though the makers have tried to black them out . why not just film in the uk , if that 's where most of the film is set ? cheap rubbish , and a waste of celluloid !
to be honest , this film is another in a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called `` masters of horror '' films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story lines ... aside from ron perlman , everyone else in this film can not act to save their life ... the gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop-it under the boom mike or something , and looked completely unrealistic ... overall , this film is about as scary as home alone ... the only good masters are cigarette burns , jennifer , and maybe pelts ... i do n't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand ...
viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence ( now that is funny ) would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle , but , trust me folks , this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see , and if you 're not laughing at it five minutes in , i 'd say you 've lost your sense of humor . david niven plays a doomed and bravado-besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable ( female ) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love , just as he 's plunging to his certain and fiery death . ( is n't it romantic ... ) of course , he 's spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance , and washes up on the beach , just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle . ( they immediately clinch ) . looking past the bizarre homo-erotic subtexts , ( so over the top you really need to refer to them as supertexts , from a naked boy sitting bare-butted in the sand playing the movie 's twilight-zone-esquire theme on his little flute , to a celestial courier so campy/queen-y his makeup is caked on more thoroughly than the ladies ' ) , the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love . we get it -- fly boys like girls in skirts and heels , and girls like 'em back , and , apparently , all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb ... as for the quality of the production , the continuity/editing is poor enough to induce cringing , and the lighting is , perhaps , even worse than that , but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad . there are games played with technicolor , ( whatever passes for heaven is in black and white if you can figure out the sense in that ) , and foreshadowing , ( so funny my fellow audience member who usually like movies like this actually cheered and laughed when then the doc 's motorcycle finally ended up in a fiery wreck ) , and freeze-motion , ( which is funniest of all because the female lead is so poor at standing still you know the stage hands were guffawing off camera ) . the best shots are the early ones on the beach , but , after that , it 's all downhill . the ( moving like an escalator is moving ) staircase is hardly the odessa steps , to say the least , and i 'd really caution anyone from feeling like they 'd have to see this lame attempt at movie-making on their account . the movie overall is bad enough to be funny , and that 's about the best thing i can say for it .
a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie . so naturally , i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 . i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself . i came away revolted and digusted . the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess . a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top.and it is not very funny at all . charles grodin is good but the buck stops there . bottom line:1 star . do n't even bother .
i just saw the third week of stephen kings ' nightmares and dreamscapes mini series ; meaning , i saw 6 episodes so far . i have to say that the stories are really weak . i have read stephen king 's skeleton crew , a collection of his short stories that was published way back . i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent , if not outstanding . what i 'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good . in fact , if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication , then most of this mini series will be average to poor . in stephen king 's defense , i have not read these new short stories . perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television , or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script . who knows . also , these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose . maybe that may have been the problem . if stephen king had submitted these crap stories to an editor , i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is , it is simply boring . what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories/script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it . seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old `` twilight zone '' series . each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting . i do n't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat . i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately , something must not have clicked . for instance , this week there were two episodes shown . the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide . the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward . feeling uncomfortable , he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him . also , the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him . ( i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode ! ) this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it , i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story . after the last scene , i was left with more questions than answers . i tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories/script . if this was a movie , i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such . i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store . however , given that this is on tnt , a cable channel , i would say if you have not seen it already , then try it for one week . if you do not like it that week , then you will not like the past series nor the future ones , since they all share the same boring trait .
loved the original story , had very high expectations for the film ( especially since barker was raving about it in interviews ) , finally saw it and what can i say ? it was a total mess ! the directing is all over the place , the acting was atrocious , the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat , empty and completely unnecessary ( whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense ? it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn manson/smashing pumpkins/placebo music video ) . whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal , some are just ridiculously laughable ( the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimi 's death was just stupidly funny ) . it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense , totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more . no explanations were given whatsoever , i mean i knew what was happening only as i 'd read the story but for people who had n't it 's even more confusing as at times even i did n't know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole time . god , i really wanted to like this film as i 'm a huge fan of barker 's work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie , hell i even enjoyed some of kitamura 's movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- i did n't care about anyone or anything , the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source , turning it into something else entirely . granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass , but everything else was all over the place , more than disappointing . gutted
really , everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else ! no wonder , the casting is done not with the left hand , but rather not at all . i have n't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent , carrying a gun . you do n't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role . the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute . the rest of the cast is likewise awful , possibly with hurt as the sole exception , sometimes you can see him trying , but suffering . oh , did i mention that it is a completely insane story ? jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family ? well , it must be because the guy ( weller ) is german ? 2/10 , because the photography could be worse .
well , basically , the movie blows ! it 's blair witch meets sean penn 's ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the `` war on terror '' is really about . the script sounds like it was written by 8th grader ( no offense to 8th graders ) ; the two main actors over-act the entire film ; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film ( not that i know anything about those things -- but it just did n't look like real documentaries i 've watched ) , and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck . it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd . i 'd rather watch the blair witch viii , than sit through that again .
that 's incredible ! fidani ( who he was also a spiritist ) was one of the cheapest director of all the world . this movie stole the original title of leone 's `` duck you sucker ! '' but tell the boring story of a pinkerton agent against the killer `` testa di ferro '' ( the improbable gordon mitchell , a stuntman ) . all is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed into the dear landscapes of lazio . the story is bad and crazy at the same time . fidani was not able and ingenuos at the same time . into the story happened some kind of crazy illogical things ( like the discussion into the sheriff 's house and the demential appearance of butch cassidy ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? yes , really butch cassidy , who is portrayed like an idiot ) . terribles nuit americaine , absurd comportaments , illogic plot , bad acting and a fugace appearance by one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of italian television , renzo arbore . ah , of course : klaus kinski . yes is great and terrible , but i 'm sure he was in it only for money an for playing with iron horses ) 2 of 10 but ... do n't miss it ! ! ! ! !
i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought , with all the good actors in it , would be worth watching . i could n't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... i was mad because i could have used that time doing something else .... i tried to figure it all out , but really had no clue . thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it .... right or wrong , it 's better than not knowing anything ! ! who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away ? how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her ? at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth . does this mean that we 're going to be subjected to end game 2 ?
this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line . bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event . there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane . i believe that mister bin would play it better . generally speaking , film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie `` stauffenberg '' from 2004 , but ca n't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever . however , movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values .
i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad . i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss ! . watch this film and have a laugh just do n't expect to see any academy awards for acting . more chance of understanding the film its self . in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this . plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original . i think its one of those love or hate movies . you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
i really wish i could give this a negative vote , because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film . the acting was just god awful , i mean realllyyyy bad , the dialog was worse , the script sounded like it was written by .... i ca n't think of anything horrible enough to say . and the day `` outside '' and the night `` inside '' shots make you think the events took over several days . terribly acted , directed , written , etc etc . all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone . stay away from this one at all costs . if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed , it is to tell the world to not watch this crap . this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously .
this film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill `` wonder of the human body '' documentaries by bravely , if bizarrely , opting to elicit disgust in the viewer . in one scene , the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it . in another , the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo . in a final tour de force , the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of ... teenage armpit hair . unfortunately , i 'm not making any of this up . see this film if you must , but : bring your vomit bag , and do n't have pasta salad beforehand .
yes , this was pure unbelievable condescending babble . we know that the french often have a skewed idea of the usa , it 's puritanism and views towards sex . as an american ( hoosier ) who lives in france , i have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes . and while some of these preconceived notions may be true , not one element of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real . a man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big ? where in the world would you find that ? a juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass ? a town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from chicago , but with no major gas station , no tvs in the home , no mcdonalds , no kids ... a population that knows each other 's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other . the adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe , have farms but do n't harvest , kill the guy they do n't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it , and all with equal emotion ? the liberated french girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity , the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy ? help ! i am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that i am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is . go see it for the a-to-z primer on what to avoid . gosh , i hope i did n't ruin it for you !
i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial . the commercial was great , but it i found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect ' in the entire movie ( about 4 ) and even some that were n't in the movie . there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember . it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people . i guess my world of innocence ended that day , when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .
i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on , it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful . i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be , surely it was deliberate . i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish , unrehearsed , badly executed way that it was beyond belief . this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas , think i am exaggerating ? well give it airtime and think again . dreadful , utterly dreadful . if this was n't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again .
there 's nothing new here . all the standard romantic-comedy scenes , even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away . the only thing that saves this is the acting of alison eastwood & some of the minor characters ( blink and you 'll miss gabrielle anwar ) , who obviously had some fun . turn it off when the pair are in bliss , and you wo n't have to go through the inevitable plot pain .
`` people i know '' is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast . pacino delivers his usual tour de force as eli wurman , a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . but unlike michael corleone , it 's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character , his dilemma , or his fate . the film traces eli 's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause , while distracted by a client 's ( ryan o'neal , good in an underwritten part ) latest `` dirty laundry '' -- in this case , a tv actress companion who 's gotten involved with the wrong people . tea leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role , although again , the script does n't give her much to work with . as eli 's sister-in-law , kim basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics . this movie is strictly for those who like watching pacino strut his stuff , and enjoy the other principals . unfortunately , between the script and direction , `` people i know '' is strictly amateurish . hence its limited theatrical release , and speedy journey to dvd . consider yourself warned .
there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movie 's trailer . i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies , but i ca n't help but support the backlash against this movie . it is slow , boring and bordering on pointless . even the `` almost nice and believable moments '' were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting . vernetta lopez and wong li lin , whom i usually love , were only passable in this movie . it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap , then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen . the leap years should come with an ra rating ( rated awful ) but it has n't changed my faith in local movies . more good films will come , so long as more films like these do n't get made .
with the exception of family , this new season is worse than season one . i ca n't imagine what they are thinking . as a fan of horror , can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem , but this series gets worse with each outing . i ca n't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day , toiling to churn out such crap . story ! is that too much to ask for ? character ! how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories ? if we are not engaged , who cares if they get carved up or whatever ? almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting , going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting . even dante 's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion . ironically , the production values and performances tend to be up to speed , while the content is utter crap . i have great hopes for exec producer 's garris 's valarie under the stairs , but we shall see .
overall an extremely disappointing picture . very , very slow build up to the basic storyline . the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past . ( every take seems to last forever . there is really no rhythm in the film . ) * * * spoilers * * * her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis , by a german woman , played by katja riemann . the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional , so stereotypical . * * * spoilers end * * * the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something . please when you do that , give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place . there is never a clear indication of time  very annoying . worst part is , the end . * * * spoilers * * * the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented , simply by a bureaucratic accident ! give me a break . that 's how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse ? the question of who freed the jews is never answered . was is goebels who freed them ? did lean fischer sleep with goebels ? in venice the film won an acting award for k. riemann , why ?  i have no idea . must be the jewish theme
the fiendish plot of dr. fu manchu ( 1980 ) . this is hands down the worst film i 've ever seen . what a sad way for a great comedian to go out .
this movie had all the elements to be a smart , sparkling comedy , but for some reason it took the dumbass route . perhaps it did n't really know who its audience was : but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot , yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women . if you have seen legally blonde and its sequel , then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel . great actors such as luke wilson should expect better material . jessica simpson could also have managed so much more . rachael leigh cook and penelope anne miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing . many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers , the various uber-cliché montages , the last minute `` misunderstanding '' , even the kids ' party chaos . this just suggests lazy scriptwriting . it should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do n't take it seriously , but it 's such a glaring could-do-better than you 'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past .
this really was the worst movie i have ever seen . michael vartan is hot , but who is this woman ? and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie , the hair is so bad ! they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry . the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is . really , really boring . i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch . i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good ? hhaha they literally just like talk and say `` yeah '' and there is no passion whatsoever . i could not tell at all that they were in love . i 'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen .
i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood-not very big-names in it . interested enough i decide to give it a shot later .. it was a tough to bear experience believe me . then , after finally seeing the credits roll i tought 'we turks really suck at hollywood style film making .. this is an insult to the heist|hostage movie genre .. ' but then wait ! i checked some names and no , they were not turkish names and no , this was not a turkish movie ; on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director & crew ! that made me thinking-again ! - how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen , edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project ? with money probably .. that kept me thinking further .. how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast ? then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer.by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find . and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then : by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce-or vice versa i do n't have any information on that- . so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as .. it makes you think -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that does n't give even that affect .. this one at least makes you think ; it makes you wonder .. it leaves you with disbelief .. and then it makes you wonder again ..
i saw `` myra breckinridge '' when it first came out in 1970 . i was a healthy 20-year-old at the time , who loved movies and really liked raquel welsh . on top of that , i had read the gore vidal novel it was based on and thought it was very funny . i saw the movie at a local drive-in and about half way through i was sorely tempted to turn the motor of my car on so that maybe i 'd die of monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie . it was n't `` smart '' or `` trendy '' , it was gross and sloppy . all the actors were tone deaf and the director did n't have the slightest idea what he was doing . the casting of mae west was one of the worst casting choices in movie history . as one reviewer here said , her role had nothing to do with the movie or book . her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud , which would never do for the legendary ms. west . oh no , the plot is changed so she sexually beats him up , very believable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age . i could go on , but why ? it was an awful movie . bluto
this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness it 's watchable and rather funny . i do n't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality . it 's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow ( as it 's the middle of winter ) . he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it 's own . this film is really stupid but it 's funny . the killings are hilarious.i would n't advise you to go and buy it ( like i did -the cover looked good ! ) but if it happens to be on tv one night and you 're up for a laugh then stick it on .
i 'm a big fan of horror flicks , and zombie films are a particular favorite of mine . that said , zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst films i have ever seen . so needless to say i really enjoyed it , it 's the best bad movie i 've seen in a long while . the story has some similarities with dan o'bannon 's `` return of the living dead '' , but whereas that film was intentionally funny , this one is the opposite . it has some of the most laughable acting i 've ever witnessed , especially from the main scientist character . his scenes with the general were just hysterical . also , the effects are subpar and in many cases sloppy , and the death scenes are often just downright stupid . this , of course , makes it all the more fun . possible spoiler - the worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the severed zombie head , which then opens its eyes and somehow flies out of the fridge ( obviously pulled out ineptly with a bit of string ) , latching onto the guys neck , killing him . zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now ? it defies every law of physics known to man , and it 's one of the most absurd things ever filmed . that 's just one of many really goofy moments in the idiotic mess . i ca n't believe it 's gotten so high a rating here . if you are a fan of bad movies , do yourself a favor and rent this sucker .
first of all , the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes ... half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes . are n't there enough brown-eyed actors out there ? jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves . he was a full-blooded jew ! second of all , what is it with old english-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-english-speaking countries , and everybody has english accents ? ( another example is david lean 's `` dr . zhivago '' . ) are n't there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent ? the movie often is not true to the scriptures , and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus 's claim to be the messiah . in the bible , when jesus is baptized by john , a voice comes from heaven saying `` this is my beloved son , in whom i am well pleased '' ( matthew 3:17 , mark 1:11 , luke 3:22 ) . in the movie , john the baptist says this ! the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy , as well . for example , in the bible , the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god ( luke 1:26-38 ) , but in the movie , we do not see or hear any angel - mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam , and when mary 's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her , she does n't hear or see anyone either . also , in the movie , when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem , he says , `` you shall not see me here again , not until you learn to cry , 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord ' , for i and my father are one and the same . '' the correct line ( matthew 23:39 and luke 13:35 ) is `` you will not see me again until you say , 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord . ' '' period . jesus never claimed to be god . the movie cuts out a lot of important parts ( the sermon on the mount is very expurgated ) , but then spends a lot of time on stuff that is n't even in the bible ( a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john ) . it seems like the screenwriter , instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures , wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind ( and between ) the scenes . the movie has one gem though - during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son , at matthew the tax collector 's house , i had tears streaming down my face . it is the best movie i 've seen about jesus 's ministry ( but that is n't saying much , because the others are just terrible ) . `` jesus christ superstar '' is my favourite movie about jesus 's last days ( `` the passion of the christ '' is way too graphic ) , though i like how `` jesus of nazareth '' , instead of just ending with jesus 's death , continues on and shows his resurrection .
i found this film to be quite an oddity . from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie , and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why . jean-marc barr , although i love him to bits ( i think zentropa is one of the best movies ever made ) is quite miscast here , and although i ca n't figure for the life of me who would be better , i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work . everything else is fine , except for the stabs at weak comedy ( a meet the parents joke is not really needed , filmmakers ! ) and i really like richard e. grant as the british major . it just suffers from one thing .. jean-marc .
the killings in this movie is n't that bad , but for sure the movie is . it 's even worse than that . it 's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd-player . not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd-store , not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it . horrible . it 's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie . it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching , add to that the group pressure from my co-watchers . the manuscript is awful , the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable . i hope you do n't see this as a spoiling your fun , i 'd rather see it as a fair warning : do not waste your time watching this garbage !
think of this film as a saturday morning live-action program from ages ago . even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses ! i ca n't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting , especially in the costume department ! too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over , but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings . and who in the world would 've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place ? i thought this was a `` family '' movie ! mst3k , here 's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season !
as an actor i really like independent films but this one is amateur at best . the boys go to vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in vermont ? pines yes - palms no . and the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees . when the boys are leaving vt they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is federal express . did they ship themselves overnight in a crate ? come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur . the christian brother is far gayer than arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo . the two should have switched roles . the minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible . applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
i am so disappointed . this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy . here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again : the neurotic upper-class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses . woody , i 've seen these characters already , i 've seen the storyline from you ten times already . where did your creativity go ? ? ? you need to open your eyes and look around you . the world has changed dramatically since annie hall - and you need to change along with it . there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again . when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out , it does nothing for me - because now i 've come to expect his old standby : the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating . depressing and same old , same old . if woody wants to win his fans back , then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted .
this film was choppy , incoherent and contrived . it was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women . i rented it because it was listed as a comedy ( that 's a stretch ) , and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it . she was n't . i 'm a gal , i watched this film with two guys , and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was . warning : plot summary below ! rampant spoilers ! the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man , to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends . they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her . but she 's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you 're rooting for them to stick it out , and sure enough , she decides to marry the guy . but her harpy girlfriend , aided by the wishy-washy one , sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her . it works . she has a fight with him , he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck ( remember the movie 's title ? ) so now he 's dead , two-thirds of the way through the film . and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls , she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant . she 's already broken off relations with her girlfriends , because they were so unsupportive . alone and pitiful , she decides to marry the boring guy . did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister ? she had asked him to marry her to the young guy ( nice , huh ? ) , but now she tells him she 'll marry him , and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion . but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home , where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed . she has the kid . in the final scene , they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink , smoke and be smug . i kid you not , it 's that bad . i left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy 's ridiculous lesbian moment .
this film , once sensational for its forward-thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation , has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity . it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries . given how socialistic sweden eventually became , the 'radicalism ' of its politics , once controversial , appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later . and its sex scenes , at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials , look pretty tame in a modern context . nevertheless , the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60 's youth rebellion . one part of the film that still holds up : its self-consciousness with respect to the 'fourth wall ' . every once in a while , the filmmakers film themselves making the film . the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle .
when robot hordes start attacking major cities , who will stop the madman behind the attacks ? sky captain ! ! ! jude law plays joe sullivan , the ace of the skyways , tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex-girlfriend polly perkins ( gwyneth paltrow ) and former flight partner , captain franky cook ( angelina jolie ) . sky captain and the world of tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming . the film 's running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie . the visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that . however , there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals . the film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary . i blame director and writer kerry conran . he focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story . the movie is like a girl with no personality , after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring . sky captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality . it 's simply just another case of style over substance . the acting is surprisingly average and that 's not really their fault since they had very little to work with . the main reason i watched this movie is because of angelina jolie . however , the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes . her performance is surprisingly bland as well . jude law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him . gwyneth paltrow was just average , nothing special at all . ling bai 's performance was the only one i really liked . she gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film . the movie is not a complete bust though . there were some `` wow '' and exciting scenes . there just were n't enough of them . the film just does n't have that hook to really make it memorable . it was actually quite bland and it was n't very engaging at all . it 's too bad the film was n't very good since it had such a promising premise . in the end , sky captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching . rating 4/10
what a horrible , horrible film . the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time . not that i saw much . i left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves . meryl streep was awful as usual . how many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have ? aidan quinn 's talents were - as so often - totally wasted . and who told gloria estefan she could act ? trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes . ( brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school ) . the kids were n't even cute ! just written in to suit the appalling script . aaargh ! wes craven really made me cringe for once . real horror this one !
i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever seen . the acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous . i get the fact that the main character 's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown , but it got so silly and boring , after a while i could have cared less about any of the characters . the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot . the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there . then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer , and the confusing ones where he meets himself . i should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i did n't recognize any of the actors . do yourself a favor when this movie comes up , read a book ! you 'll be better off .
ivan ( valeri nikolayev ) is a bitter , cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained . he travels to this small town where it 's said that a witch ( ita ever ) is terrorizing the community . his car stalls and he takes refuge in a small building , and meets a beautiful , mysterious girl . suddenly she turns into a demon and he kills her , and the town is wondering who murdered this woman ... who i guess was the witch but i am not entirely sure . ivan is now being pursued by her spirit , or something , and he has to have faith , or something , to beat it . i really hate christian films . they are usually filled with lame actors , stupid storyline and minimal effects . not to mention that this is n't just a christian film ... but a foreign one as well . the voice-over actor for ivan made the movie more comical than terrorizing , because it is so high pitched and whiny . you wo n't miss much by missing out on this film .
anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film . this film is not under-rated ... it is a bad movie . there should be no comparisons between this film and the naked gun or airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny . class reunion is neither of those things . the sad thing is it had such potential ( good cast , good story lines ) but the good jokes are few and far between . the scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing . the stoner guys , the vampire , the blind girl ... not funny . the only funny character were delores ( the one who sold her soul to the devil ) . national lampoon has made some really good films ( animal house , vacation ) but this is n't one of them . i certainly expected more from john hughes .
this movie is extremely boring , it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life . nothing exciting ever happens . the director has really `` kept it real '' and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life . i had to watch other films by this director for a class , the others were not as boring . this film was also watched for an assignment ... it better be worth the boringness with a good grade ! ! overall , unless it 's required , do n't watch the film . but do n't discount other films by this director , because they 're not as bad ... and do n't discount other films about africa , they 're usually good , especially when done by a western director .
as an army veteran , i was deeply offended by this film . in my opinion , it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war . to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement . if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon ( it was ) , it would have been better received . but it was taken seriously my many people , especially overseas . silly as it sounds , wherever i went in europe in the late 80 's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film . unrealistic ? hmm , let 's see . a monosyllabic , muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american pow 's . in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats . and he never misses , running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm . i could go on , but i 'm getting a headache . i gave this a 2/10 only because it 's slightly better than rambo iii .
over the last 20 years the majority of british films are about how horribly poverty stricken the uk is and how our youth does n't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of british cities . the british film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken britain ' . trainspotting , this is england , kidulthood , football factory , kes and from london to brighton . bullet boy is just another british movie added to that list . the main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing . i was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade . in fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around . instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder . i felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film , which is sad because at the beginning of the film i really liked the entire family and their desire for success . i believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it ( like the pursuit of happiness ) . i know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of britain but do n't we already have enough films in the uk with that very same plot ? is n't it time these talented producers and writers give britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner ? i applaud the makers of bullet boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors ( like kidulthood , football factory ) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of british films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch . there is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others i have mentioned .
there is no reason to see this movie . a good plot idea is handled very badly . in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense . the reason for the killings are not made clear . the acting is awful . nick stahl obviously needs a better director . he was excellent in in the bedroom , but here he is terrible . amber benson from buffy , has to change her character someday . even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed . even though the movie was 80 minutes , which is too short for a good movie ( but too long for this one ) , there are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters . do n't spend the time on this one .
i can not believe how popular this show is . i consider myself an avid sci-fi fan . i have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and tv shows . i really would n't even consider this true sci-fi . every episode i have sat through was like a lame , watered down version of a star trek episode , minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting . it 's basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues , talking about something boring , who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth , with people who look and sound just like humans ! it seemed extremely low budget . the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts , and the many attempts at humor fall flat . it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it , trying to be funny , but he is not . it is just sad . the movie was terrible as well . there is so much you can do with a portal through space , yet every place the army people go is boring ! this shows no imagination ! i actually thought the tv series `` alien nation '' from a few years back ( based on the movie alien nation ) was much better . that show actually had good story lines and decent characters . i was n't crazy about `` alien nation '' , but compared to this overrated crap , it was great ! also , unlike the great new `` battlestar galactica '' series , `` stargate '' copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely ! they should have at least updated the cheesy `` toilet flushing '' special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate .
this film is easily one of the worst ones i have ever seen . and i do n't mean that in a good way . we wanted to see a crappy horror/thriller , so we picked the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store . for once , the film was everything we 'd expected . and more ! ( or should i say less ? ) the actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera . the so-called special effects are created by putting red see-through plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the killer rats . and the script ? do n't even get me started on the script ... and just when you thought it could n't get any worse , it turns out that the first part of the film was oscar-material compared to the ending . take it from me , this film is hilarious if you 're into crappy horror-films , but if you want a good film , keep on looking . this is not for you .
steven seagal .... how could you be a part of such an awful film ? i rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean . i have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one . very , very poor taste ! i am embarrassed that i even rented this movie . steven , if you keep acting in movies like this one , i believe that your career is over . my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can `` get the bad guy '' with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean ... and also the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this one is something else . i will think twice before i rent another movie of yours .
this film is beautiful to look at , but is like watching really bad experimental theater . the plot ( if there was one ) does n't make any sense . but it is very `` artistic '' . lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other 's eyes . lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame . mumbling and people wandering wistfully . lingering close-ups of faces and bodies . by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat , you 'll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the screen . it is supposed to be about a father and son 's relationship , but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f * $ & each other and get it over with . if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots , your wish has been granted .
i saw this movie a couple years back . i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on . so i peeped it . what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing . richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with richard 's girl while she 's unconscious . then jarvis 's buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar . by the next morning it shows richard 's girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he 's still tied up . then they play some happy music and the movie is finished . i mean what happened ? did they brake up ? and what was she saying to those 2 guys ( trouby and jarvis ) ? its to puzzling and to poor to . i ca n't stand movies that are disturbing and do n't make sense . this was the worst film i 've ever seen since the 90 's version of lord of the flies .
`` metamorphosis '' hold a tiny bit of cult-value , simply because it was written and directed by george eastman . this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d'amato production during the late 70's/early 80 's . would n't it be interesting for avid euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in `` erotic nights of the living dead '' all the time ? i thought so ! now , unlike the movies he starred in , eastman 's own `` metamorphosis '' is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments . there are a handful of nasty murders , cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies ( a guest appearance by sleaze-queen laura gemser ! ) on display , but it 's mainly a talkative movie . the handsome & eloquent dr. houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds . he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process , but if he does n't come up with detailed reports any time soon , his research will be stopped . so dr. houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins . needless to say ( and like the title implies ) , he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker ! in other words , his research sucked ! like the other reviewers already mentioned , this movie `` borrows '' a lot of ideas from david cronenberg 's `` the fly ''  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but does n't add any originality from its own . the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblum 's character in `` the fly '' , whereas dr. houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible . the rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodato 's sadly underrated giallo `` phantom of death '' , only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and did n't inflict it on himself . the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films , though . few scares or excitement to discover here , instead the movie features loads of bad acting , poor lighting , lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot . feel free to skip this one .
i saw this movie in 1979 , i was 17 or 18 , when it was released . the theater was perhaps 1/4 full when the movie started . ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater . the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back . we decided to stay for the entire movie .... why endure such torture ? ? ... here 's why . we wanted to be true movie critics ... to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie ( a 10 ) they always come up with something better . but , it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made ( and this is it ... a 1 at best ) . there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a 1 , but i have yet to see them . i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst .... i am a true movie critic ... he he .
a trio of low-life criminals , led by matt dillon , botches a late-night burglary . they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist . of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist , the real terrorist gets away , and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar , taking hostages , unaware why the police are so intent on catching them . and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night ? unbelievable ? absolutely . and it goes down hill from there . spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent ; matt dillon , faye dunaway , gary sinise , viggo mortensen , and m. emmett walsh , but they 're all wasted . mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar , all they do for the remainder of the film is argue . endlessly and aimlessly . long before the conclusion of the film you 've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them .
i love jamie foxx . and i enjoy 99 % of all movies i see . and i walked out of this one . now , i admit , it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing ( `` oh no , jamie 's knocking on a door ! hee hee hee ! `` ) , but ... this was just so incredibly annoying . there could be no sustained camera shot , and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in-your-face , loud , and annoying . the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich-like , but at this point , it 's just old and tired . he brought nothing new or interesting . from all the characters , too many lines you saw coming , too many you 've heard before , and too many `` tough guy '' lines ... and i do n't mind that sort of thing , really , as long as there 's a bit of originality to it . in fact , pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked . i love jamie foxx , and i think he 's really funny , and i thought he was funny in this movie ... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else . this movie needed less shoot-em-up , less annoying camera shots , more emotion , more feeling , and more jamie foxx . i gave it a 2 .
sergio leone spins in his grave ... if there was any film that tramples upon a man 's life work its this one . the lead character 's `` lone wolf '' bravado is uninspiring and lame , and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education . whoever 's idea this was should be horse whipped . the only reason i 'm spending time trashing it is because there 's a 10 line minimum . sergio leone 's family should sue , not because its crap , but because now it 's immortalized as crap by mst 3000 . shame . disgust . i blame hollywood ... at least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon experts ... this film is pure blasphemy .
universal soldier : the return is not the worst movie ever made . no , that honor would have to go to a film that attempted to make some sort of statement or accomplish some artistic feat but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner . however , perhaps no movie i have ever seen has tried for so little and succeeded so completely as did universal soldier : the return . this film is a sci-fi/action travesty that has virtually nothing to recommend it . the acting is as bad as any movie i 've ever seen . the plot is terrible and predictable . the special effects are pathetic . in short , anyone even remotely connected to this film should be ashamed of themselves . us : the return makes previous van damme fare seem like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces . some movies are so bad , they 're good . believe me when i tell you that this is not one of them . i 'm really not sure what else to say here . i doubt many people were considering seeing this movie if they had n't already , but just in case : do n't .
i tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler . i also assume that you 've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist , so if you have n't some of this might not make sense . plot : this movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across . we are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose , and destiny , and choice , and forced to endure the long , torturous platitude sessions that contain them . neo , awakened from a dream in the last movie , now begins a period of realization about his own existence . there are a lot of revelations in this movie , which i 'll be vague about so they wo n't seem like spoilers . * if you 're still worried vague references will spoil the movie , do n't read the paragraph below . * the strength and weakness of faith is revealed . the strengths and weaknesses of love , and its temporary nature , are also revealed . the interdependence of humans and technology , and our faith in technology , are also revealed . the importance of choice and experience is revealed . explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail , so i will refrain ( as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks ) . btw , by `` revealed '' i mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails . storyline : so how does neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one ? in short , they keep the faith , and use and abuse overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it 's going out of style ( and after this display , i 'm hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more ) . more on that later . to not spoil anything , i will say no more than the promo material already did : neo is still trying to figure out the matrix , and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans , and zion , all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts . the movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off . action : while martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts , this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay , adding swords , sais , etc . to the mix . special effects are so often used and waved in the audience 's face that it becomes really tiresome . i 've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike , and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences -- especially the `` smith fight '' we all heard would be in the movie -- to be too long and tedious . this is a huge red flag for action fans , because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more , or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured . these fights scenes do neither . they are over-stylized , over-the-top sequences that are wooden and uninspired . in the first movie , there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action , a sense that fighting was for survival , not just looking good ( which i honestly do n't think they manage in reloaded anyway ) in black and leather . go watch drunken master or iron monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are -- you wo n't regret it . in addition , the `` matrix abilities '' people have in reloaded is not consistent , and what they actually do is not consistent . the first movie had its inconsistencies here , but they were n't too glaring -- unlike reloaded . special effects are poured on and on and on . every little thing someone does , be it just jump , somersault , spin , and in many cases just pose , are slow-moed , bullet-timed , or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction . it 's evident the w bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie , and boy did they throw it , with no real restraint . sharp editors could have really helped this , but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given , which brings us to . . . character and dialogue : i have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes . actors ca n't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience 's face , or neglecting it altogether . the audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own . keanu 's acting performance is stiff at best . keanu is good at acting confused , and that 's about all he does in this film . he makes a decent attempt to show passion between neo and trinity , but it falls flat . lawrence tries to make morpheus everything from moses to henry v , and be as cool as a cat throughout . with the script he is provided , he makes a noble attempt , but it also falls flat . moss is n't very believable either . her look of concern is always the same , much like keanu 's , and the chemistry is n't there , although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough . hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an agent program , but he too suffered from the script 's hand . i actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch , but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge , drawn out fight scene . all in all , this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations , and on its own , as a stand-alone movie ( which is not how it 's supposed to be taken ) , it 's still horrible . i do n't see the matrix as deep , but i at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas , good action , a few funny lines , and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive . reloaded fails on all these counts , and i really hope the w bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment . granted , i do n't have a lot of hope left for that after this film .
in hollywood in the 1930 's and 1940 's , i think that every studio can make a western , except warner bros . the few times they try , it always ridiculous ( except , perhaps , for they died with their boots on - which is a cavalery western . ) i have read that humphrey bogart , seing james cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head , said that he looks like a mushroom . true ! cagney and bogart are too urban , too xxe century to be credible in a western movie . the story here had no suprise , and it did't help . every 10 minutes , i figure i can see bogart and cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930 's black car .
well to answer one persons 's question of `` why does n't anyone remember this film ? '' it 's because really , not that many people saw it in 1978 and it 's not been shown much on tv since . ( if it 's on video that 'd be news to me ! ) even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s , movie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film . unless they love billy crytal , paul lynde or joan rivers `` that '' much ! paul lynde was funnier on `` bewitched '' or `` hollywood squares '' than here . joan rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer karen carpenter 's lack of weight ! har-har joan ! it also seems like every `` somewhat '' famous name from the era is in the cast . ( most surprising is doris roberts later of `` everybody loves raymond '' . ) anyhow , a somewhat good idea for a storyline , a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here . with help from a male friend crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was `` on top '' instead of him , he gets pregnant ! ( a commentary on women taking positions of power away from men ) . crystal 's stomach grows , he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings . unfortunately , he is now a socially misunderstood outcast ! he 's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out ( i guess ) . he 's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby ... in a barn . or if you will , a manger ( god only knows where it may have exited from ! ewwww ! ) it turns out ( no shock here ) to be a girl ! everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable , the humor is high school level or less . 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ billy crystal . ignore the rest of rabitt test , it flunks big time ! i ca n't believe roddy mcdowell signed on either ! ( end )
there are people out there who will greenlight anything ! that is the only explanation i can offer as to why the house of the dead movie exists . and that 's only scary part to the whole movie . it 's so bad you 'll go off movies forever . i seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the tv over to the paint drying channel but i was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing . i do n't know why i do these bad things to myself . as if it matters , here 's the basic jist of the 'story ' . a group of twenty-somethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the pacific northwest ( canada actually , because it 's cheap ) for the 'rave of the century ' ( which consists of about 8 people and un-raving music ) that they pay some craggy old fisherman $ 1000 to take them there after they miss the main ferry . that 's got ta be some rave to be worth all that dough ! the fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead ( hang on-i thought this was house of the dead ? ) and that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda . first faults here . why would a tiny little rave ( of the century my foot ! ) be held on some remote island ? why would anyone willingly pay loads of money to get it ? why pay even more to the craggy old fisherman to take them back when they could just come back with the others ? once they arrive they discover that the rave ( which consists of about 2 tents , a small stage and a port-a-john ) has been smashed , there 's blood everywhere and no one is around . what would any rationally thinking person do ? run for their lives of course . but no , these clueless , obviously blind people decide to go look for them . soon enough they discover an old ramshackle house that 's 50 times as big on the inside as it is on the outside . another half hour of stumbling around in the forest follows , as an excuse to kill of some of the lesser characters , and after much tedium they arrive back at the house again . the characters , like the movie , go nowhere . jammed into this ghastly disaster is a superabundance of gibberish dialogue , heinous acting , mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillions of clips from the once-popular arcade game of the same name . why this was universally accepted as a good idea with the filmmakers i 'll never know . the clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade this trash even further , if that is at all possible . it has nothing to do with the game save for some cheap , throwaway line at the end . it makes resident evil look like cinematic glory . hell , even the double dragon movie seems multi-oscar worthy in comparison to this junk . the only one who comes out of this with his dignity still intact is jurgen prochnow . he could have just taken his money and ran but he tries his best with the awful script and brings a tiny bit of pathos to his character . the rest of the cast suck i 'm afraid . the characters are idiots and deserve to die . plus , if you cut out the swearing and pointless nudity , i see no reason why this film can not be shown on saturday morning tv . it 's not frightening in the slightest . pirates of the caribbean is more scary than the skeletal bad guys in this film . and where did all those bad guys come from anyway ? there were only a few people on the island to begin with . i guess this justifies the reason they chose to reuse footage over and over . i kid you not , you 'll see the same zombie die a dozen times . who 's ultimately to blame for that scandalous waste of celluloid ? none other than director uwe boll . his control over the movie is non-existent . you can clearly the see actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies are n't really taking it all seriously . the actors seem like they 're reading off cue cards as they constantly pause in the middle of long sentences and carry on talking as soon as they see the next card . it all feels very unnatural . plus the film is shot like a two-part mini-series . i have indeed seen better tv productions . and do n't get me started on the editing . the film is an incoherent babble with thousands upon thousands of pointless shots and dozens of meaningless camera pans . no real skill or talent was put into making this at all . it truly baffles and boggles the mind how movies this unfathomably bad can get made and george a. romero ca n't even get anyone to take his calls . house of the dead makes some idiotic reference to romero in a lazy attempt to be 'post-modern ' but it only irritates that they think this is in the same league as a real zombie movie . for what it 's worth , the 1.85:1 anamorphic picture looks great and the dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce the heavily over-used adr even more . the dvd comes with extras but why torture yourself . is n't this review warning enough ? stay away ! you are all doomed i tell you ! doomed ! doomed ! ! !
hello boys and girls ... this is n't your regular movie review , because this is going to be the cold . hard . truth . are you serious ? this movie sucked so many balls i could n't keep them out of my mouth ! they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen . you 'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie . the plot was very lacking . the actors were terrible . i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit . do boys , everyone ! peace r & h besties4lyf
where to start ... if this movie had been a dark comedy , i would say it was fannn-tastic ! unfortunately for me , and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare ( mind you that was the price i paid , got it from wal-mart ) , this movie was meant to be a thriller . the only thrill i got was watching kirkland 's lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area . if you want a good laugh , on a rainy friday night with some friends , then i highly recommend this movie . but if you want to watch something at least half way decent , then do n't even bother . i for one enjoy crappy films , the worse the better in most cases . but wow ... i meant wow ! ! the only person in the entire film that did n't stink it up was the little boy , played by vincent berry . the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do .
i do n't know who wrote the script for this movie , but from the first moment on , i was irritated . of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains , why do they make the decision , which is the most dangerous of all ? why do the criminals act dumb , although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it ? why does n't the main criminal land the helicopter , shoot stallone , grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage ? and there are more cases of illogical behavior . i 'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery , but due to the illogical behavior of the characters , i just can give this movie 1 point ...
do n't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it 's ambivalent about the japanese whaling industry ( which , morally , is no worse than the us meat trade or the scottish haggis cull ) , it stinks cos it 's pretentious tosh , the sort of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name . that said , there are some stunning images , but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination , so that 's no reason to go and see this nonsense . what happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted , and then , just when you thinks it 's finished , it starts again . i saw it it in a porn cinema in rome which had been hired for the weekend to show barney 's film works , which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the dirty-old-men-in-macs brigade , but if the trendy young things and the slightly older beard-stroking bjork fans were to be honest , everyone might have had a lot more fun if they 'd just shown one of the pornoes !
i wondered why john wood was not playing dr. falken until i watched the film . bad plot , bad science , bad acting and overall a bad film . please do n't watch this film . rent the original `` war games '' if you are feeling nostalgic . i did n't like the bending of the plot to beat-the-terrorist-threat idea either . in the first film w.o.p.r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u.s.a . in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat . politics aside , one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end . no such insight is offered in this film .
freeway killer , is a madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone . the police believe he is a random killer , but sunny , the blond heroine , played by darlanne fluegel detects a pattern . so does the ex-cop , played by james russo , and they join forces , and bodies , in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses . also starring richard belzer , this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases , but its really not a good movie for the most part , check it out if you 're really bored and have already seen the hitcher , joy ride , or breakdown , otherwise stay away from the freeway .
for the life of me , i can not get why they would want to make a movie about the `` jerry springer show '' . it 's so incrediably trashy . some ways , sadly it 's a guilty pleasure . we all have to admit that we 've seen at least one episode . it 's part of our pop culture . i saw this on usa recently . it 's pretty bad . i will admit that . jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting . or something like it . jamie pressley is in it . she 's playing herself basically . all she needed was her lover boy , kid rock . it would 've been perfect then . so , i would recommend skipping `` ringmaster '' . just watch the `` jerry springer show '' . it 's more enjoyable than this . 2/10
i have to admit that this `` re-imagining '' of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment . specially when taken into consideration that this is a tim burton film . he is defenetly one of the most original and , might i say , cool directors hollywood has produced . i am personally a great fan of his work , but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick , the planet of the apes . i really enjoyed the original film . when it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70 's science fiction film , but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong . it had indeed a clear cut message . an obvious anti-war message . fear of the cold war , where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers . those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic . although , the new film , the `` re-making '' or whatever , leaves us with nothing . no message , no ideals behind it . it is just another money-minded summer blockbuster . visually tim burton does not let you down . the dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific . obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film . there has to be an exciting plot or storyline . in this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out . the script is very lame and it is full of gaps . it looks like this film had been written in a big hurry . the explanation for why the apes where there , and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance . it raised a lot of questions , which had no reasonable answers to . for example ; why did the apes speak english ? , why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet ( given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet ) where the hell did all of those humans come from ? how were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years . ( i mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man ! ) and finally , the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb . it was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end , then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending . the ending also raises a lot of questions , which i know , don´t have intelligent answears . did theid learn to work the space ship ? , which was power-less , and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand ? , and , what did he do , breed with all the women ? and lets say that that would happen , i higly doubt that history would stay the same , like washington would be built exactly like it is today ! ( i mean woul n't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial ? ) well , just to say something posative about the film . some of the cast was great . helen bonham carter 's character was interesting and well-acted , as for tim roth as theid . he was very good , a little exaturated at some points of the film . michael clark duncan was also fine . i was not happy with marc whalberg . he is not much of an actor , and plays here a very macho colour-less character . very unbielevable and is nothing compared to hestons character in the original . and the main female character had no reason or place in the film . she was just casted for the looks . hardly said a word throughout the entire film . well , i think that in the future when people think about the planet of the apes , they will think about the original one . the latest will soon be forgotten .
when i was 16 i saw the documentary : `` a funny thing happened on the way to the moon '' . i actually liked , and believed in it for a couple of years . but then i grew up , and began to think , and when i had sought more information . this is : more info from reel sources , and non-biased sources . when i started at university , not so long ago , i asked an assistant-professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories . what he said shocked me : he said that all those theories where lies . that baffled me , i did not believe it first , but then he presented evidence for his claims . he quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject : `` humans did not go to the moon '' . the most outrages claim was that the apollo-craft could not travel through the van-allen-radiation-belt , without the crew perishing from radiation . the truth is that the americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation-alloy . it is not that well-known . and the exact specifications are a secret . and why is it a secret : well , why should they reveal it back then ? ? if they where in a space race with the russians , then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation . and then there is the biggest evidence of all : the moon stones . when the apollo-missions did go to the moon , they brought back many rocks from the moon , to give to geologists and similar scientists , who are documenting all things about the moon . these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon . because : the internal basic elements , which all matter consist of , are also made of special isotopes , that are different from quarry to quarry , land to land , and especially planet from planet . the isotopes of these rocks and stones have been proved , that they do not come from earth . the astronauts brought home hundreds of kilogram 's of these rocks , all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth , and from the same planet . ergo : the moon-landings where not fake . nasa did go to another planet : the moon , though it is not a planet , but a satellite to a planet , a moon ( duuh ) . these rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world . it has been proved : humans did go to the moon - it is a fact , pronto . but i do not worry : most conspiracy-theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated , that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts . the fact remains : humans did walk on the moon .
`` feast of all saints ? '' where ... ? when ... ? was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out ? what a waste of a wonderful title ! there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the `` feast of all saints . '' nor is there anything in the story about `` all souls day '' which the term is referencing . why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about `` all souls day '' or the `` feast of all saints '' ? embarrassly bad script & amateur writing how did they attract such great talent to this clunker ? the writing is so amateur -- characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience . not at all the way people talk to each other . what was the director thinking ? the directing is equally bad ! the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish . in one scene , a character is yelling `` take your hands off of me '' and no one is touching him ! the most badly directed scene however , is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the beginning of the film . excessive gore in a very fake , silly battle scene there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene . it looks like a saturday night live skit ! ! you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera . everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys -- exaggerating every little gasp and twitch . the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes . this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie . you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline . who in real life would ever behave this way ? ! the most ridiculous bit of writing , directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene : a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father -- who is terribly mutilated , and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds . even a totally idiot would know he is dead ! yet she is -- very monotonously -- repeating over and over `` daddy , daddy ... '' while looking at someone off-screen . she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non-actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day . even if the poor kid had any acting skills , the scene is completely unbelievable . the little girl would n't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage -- surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies , while she calmly stands there ! ! natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified , running away from the bloody carnage ! are we suppose to be horrified or laugh ... ? ! one particularly goofy detail , that gives the scene an snl satire tone , is the father hanging , with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek . he looks like a fish on a hook ! the unintentionally funny details , make the whole scene come across as fake and silly . in fantasy la-la-land , mothers and daughters are the same age ! another funny detail , is that you see a central character -- the little girl 's mother -- at the end of the scene and in the next scene , that occurs 20+ years later , she looks exactly the same ! she is still young and beautiful , and now the same age as her daughter ! i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful -- but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors . i do n't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles ! who was the targeted audience ? the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows . it is also a strange way to start a movie that , for the rest of the time , seems targeted to romance novel reading females . weird inconsistency in tone !
in the wake of lock , stock and two smoking barrels , the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late '90s-early '00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then . in one of the all-time great cases of pearls-from-swine , the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote 'the best film of the century ' from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because , at the time of writing , it was the only film that had been released in 2000 . looking at it today it 's hard to imagine how it ever got made , uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia 's lads mags brigade  rhys ifans , sadie frost , nick moran and joseph fiennes  but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel . that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no-one really knows what it is , or perhaps simply do n't think it matters . something to do with ifans ' businessman being set up with steven berkoff 's homicidal russian crime lord in a money-laundering or investment scheme ( it 's never clear which because no-one ever asks ) by fiennes ' crooked irish accountant , who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company . things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on , ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald 's ludicrously accented russian temptress , berkoff keeps on saying `` bizniss '' and `` francis drake '' and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love does n't mean he 's any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts . when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr , you know a film is in deep trouble . with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget , it fails completely in the cool stakes it 's aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own , sitting there like a joke shop dog turd .
nice attempt and good ideas ( redemption of the prostitute , human beings helping each other out , ... ) but a poor result ... the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam ... the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when `` the scent of the green papaya '' had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of ambiance ( muffled sounds and the slow pace of life ... ) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake . besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious . i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel , ex-marine in the movie , was probably stationed during the war ... but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors ... seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker . an old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful ( not a disease for people of his condition ) , a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry , ... even more doubtful ...
aaron spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film . it plays like a probable failed series pilot . handsome clint walker is u.s . marshal dave harmon , who wanders into yuma , arizona territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive . walker takes the other brother to jail . walker also meets a `` cute '' homeless mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse . one night , andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him , pinning the murder on walker . not good for your first twenty four hours on the job . walker visits the local army fort , and rankles the chains of the commander . the bigwig hears of his brothers ' deaths , and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well . the local native population , who get short changed by the army on their beef , also get rankled in the chains area . with all these chains getting rankled , walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner . the army guy involved in the murder ends up dead , the local cattle buyer is implicated , the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying , and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss , someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along . there is a semi-subplot involving the death of walker 's family at the hands of army raiders , and i think this would have been the force behind the series , had it been picked up . instead , the film ends abruptly , and i kept waiting for scenes from next week 's exciting episode . because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks , the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits . walker is handsome , rugged , and has a voice deeper than a well . the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies . much of the action is pretty lame , and the violence is tepid . the first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso , and falls without a scratch on him . i did not expect `` reservoir dogs , '' but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns ! speaking of children , the mexican kid here goes from `` cute '' to `` aneurysm inducing annoyance '' very quickly . if you dislike westerns , then you will dislike `` yuma . '' if you like westerns , then you will still dislike `` yuma . '' i can not recommend it . this is unrated , but contains physical violence and gun violence .
this is almost certainly the worst western i 've ever seen . the story follows a formula that is especially common to westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel . this formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . the scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting ; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth , maturity , and realism . the sound is bad ; it sometimes looks dubbed . the cinematography is lame , and the sets are sometimes just facades . the acting is pitiful ; sure , some of the performers could blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho . and speaking of chris lybbert , who plays hopalong , check out his duds ( if you dare to watch this film ) : he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard-working , down-and-dirty cowboy . if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy , then get this , but if you have more than two neurons , watch something else .
think of the ending of the grudge 2 with the following : - a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - sarah michelle gellar cutting herself - and a creepy mirror oh and underwater sea animals ... yay ... not a good movie ... i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever . the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching it ... i ca n't believe i went . save your time and money ... go watch saw iii ... a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it ... im mike and im out
as usual , i went to watch this movie for a.r.rahman . otherwise , the film is no good . rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful . but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure . after this he delivered a hit with chandramukhi . i am eagerly waiting for his forth coming shivaji . i have read the other user 's comment on rajni . i found it interesting as the user is from tn too . rajni is one actor who acts , i think , from his heart not from his mind . he is not a method actor like kamal hasan . i think we need to appreciate rajni for his strong going at his age . any ways , i need to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so wish u good luck rajni ...........

i was n't expecting this to be a great movie , but neither was i expecting it to be so awful . i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel . i turned it back , hoping it was just one part of the movie , but no . and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed , or almost done out of a job , or driven to madness inside her own home ? are you kidding me ? i was raised to respect ( and even fear ) my mother but i 'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house . i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother 's house , after all . i did n't buy any of it . i tried giving it several chances , i really did . sorry .
tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers , and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie . well , all i can say is i totally regretted it ! these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant , unimaginative and kitch to the extreme ( not that this is bad on its own ) sketches that are supposed to make people laugh , but fail to do so . the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend , and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-i ca n't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap ! fortunately tim robbins and john cusack have n't disappointed me ever since . i would recommend you to avoid this film , unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled .
wow ! i 'm shocked to learn that it 's a small world and that we are all interconnected . what a waste of 88 minutes . john dunne put it much better in one sentence . `` no man is an island . '' the acting was n't bad . the kids gave it all they had but at times the thread got so thin i could n't follow it and the only real `` hero '' in the film ends up in jail after being tormented by a meter maid . i do n't know . i just do n't get it . oh well .
at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films , the guy is usually unpopular with girls . in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin . but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years ? one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them . i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs . they 've done the gross out movies . they 've done the let 's act like all americans have a mental age of 15 . where will they go next ? this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it .
oh-so-familiar comedy story about low-key nice-guy paul ( jason lee ) , who after the night of his bachelor party , wakes up in bed with becky ( julia stiles ) , an attractive blonde he met just the night before . after lying about it to his fiancée karen ( selma blair ) , he 's forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks . i 'm sure most of us have been witness to a story like this at least once before ... on film or on tv . the movie is formulaic and extremely predictable , with an ending you may see coming a mile away . at least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable . lee is just right in the lead , and stiles is a lot of fun in a light-hearted comedic role different from the very serious roles she usually plays . becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes . but you know , this is n't exactly well-written . at least one question is left unanswered : for what , exactly , is ray ( lochlyn munro ) , becky 's brutal ex-boyfriend , being investigated by the i.a. ? and i did n't like the character of buck ( david koechner ) , paul 's stepfather ; he 's a super-obnoxious moron who got on my nerves so quickly i was begging for somebody to punch him . add another debit : a gratuitous , uncredited cameo by comic/actor larry miller , once again playing a grouch ( in this case , it 's a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister ) . not good at all , but as usual for me , i give it a three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone .
i 'll keep this short as a movie like this does n't deserve a full review . given the setting , this movie could have been something really special . it could have been another `` 28 days later '' or even a `` blair witch project '' the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited , directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense , although i do n't think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground . characters were a big let down . our `` heroine '' in this movie is a worthless piece of crap , and you really do n't care if she dies or not . as many people have said before , i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy , who managed to give me a chuckle or two ( whether intentional of the writers or not ) . the main villain , is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie , but when he is revealed i was really disappointed . i wo n't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match . all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula . this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark . just to highlight how lame this movie was , the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain . instead they run away .
this movie was awful and an insult to the viewer . stupid script , bad casting , endless boredom . in the usual tradition of hollywood , the government of the us is shown as always evil . the communist-sympathizer nitwits in hollywood , most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks , love taking the lone nutcase eugene mccarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement . the truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the soviet communists for political gain . oh yeah , and the us brought over all those evil nazis . like werner vonbraun , without whom we would have no space program . he actually loved being american and became a great asset to the country . and yet the irony is that the fools in hollywood , an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence , still believe that the government should run everything and give us all what we want . and yet , this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this .
shame really - very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end . i 've seen quite a few of ira levin 's adaptations - 'rosemary 's baby ' and 'the stepford wives ' - and liked both them , but this just did n't appeal to me . when i read the plot outline - an award winning playwright ( michael caine ) decides to murder one of his former pupils ( christopher reeve ) and steel his script for his own success - i was excited . i like thrillers , michael caine 's a good actor , sidney lumet 's a good director and ira levin 's work is generally good . i wo n't spoil it for anyone who has n't seen it yet , but all i 'd say is there are loads of twists and turns . so many its kind of hard to explain the film 's plot line in detail , without giving it away . i enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes , before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out . though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud . the main cast - michael caine , christopher reeve , dyan cannon and irene worth - were all brilliant in their roles . though worth 's obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly ( nothing personal irene , i think any actor 's fake accent would irritate me ) . not sure if cannon 's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time . anyone reading this - i do n't want you to be put-off watching this because of my views - give it a chance , you may like it , you may not . it 's all about opinion .
the over-heated plot of `` bonjour tristesse '' is taken from a juvenile first novel by francoise sagan , which became a best-seller , though god knows why . for teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal . do n't be taken in by the fact that david niven plays the playboy father and deborah kerr the step-mother-in- prospect . unfortunately , too much rests on the frail shoulders of jean seberg . she 's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager . the problem is that she can strike poses but she ca n't act . anyone who saw her as joan of arc in otto preminger 's st. joan -- seberg 's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film . this movie , also by preminger , fulfills the `` promise '' of the first . it was her second movie ; she was now 20 . what was preminger thinking ? that niven and kerr could compensate for seberg 's lack of acting capacity ? not a chance ? seberg 's character is at the center of the story and , pretty though she is , convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old , she ca n't meet the emotional demands of the role . i do n't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures . but anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check . in spite of niven and kerr , this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons .
dire . just dire . the script is contrived , the acting painful , and the story just drags along . it is , without a doubt , a celebration of sally potter and little else . this would n't be so bad , but she 's the director , writer and star of the film , and so is just self-glorification . i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters , and the ending came not a moment too soon . it has two redeeming features . first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely , particularly in paris , and look rather good in black and white . secondly , whether you 're a fan of tango or not , the music is by and large , excellent ( except where sally starts singing ) . watch this film at your own risk , or if you need an unintentional laugh . i am sure it appeals to someone . statistically , it has to .
this `` film '' attempts to follow the genre of low budget , hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful . this one , fails , and how . it 's amazing how many so called `` awards '' this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover ..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this .... words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is . seriously , it 's that bad . i watched it in 20 minutes flat , on almost continual fast forward . from rubbish lighting to dreadful directing , grainy visuals to muffled sound , and of course not forgetting the abysmal acting , this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making . it seriously , has no redeeming qualities - whatsoever . save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick , there are plenty out there - dead end , the blair witch , rec , to name but a few . avoid this rubbish at all costs . do not waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film . take heed of all the other comments ! you 've been warned !
when i first saw this movie , it was titled terror on a train and was the back half of a double feature . glenn ford , an armament expert is called on to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives . the tension is slow and steady ; and this black & white film runs only about an hour and twelve minutes . all these years later on tv ; the tension and drama has lost most of its impact . this is still a good movie as far as early 50s standards go . along with ford are anne vernon and maurice denham . the villain/saboteur is played by victor maddern .
it 's interesting that all who ( so far ) seemed to like this film had no expectations -- i guess that 's the trick . in contrast with them , i had optimistic expectations , and that was a mistake . as soon as i saw how close to the faces the camera always was , i knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director -- that 's always a clear sign of them , they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors . the actors in this film , though , had only one facial expression each . if the close camera was n't enough , the lack of light in the film killed it . the film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark . so now we know that the cinematographer was a rank amateur , as well . `` ooh ooh , we 're going to light the set with a flashlight ! that will make it all seem intimate ! '' no , that made it all seem invisible . on top of the serious technical flaws , there was absolutely no story beyond the barest hint of an idea that was never developed , and nothing new about this kind of relationship was illuminated . ( perhaps this is a new kind of film for germany , but in los angeles , forget about it . ) the fact that this film won a couple of film festival awards does n't indicate the quality of the film , but besmirches the quality of these particular festivals . i can assure you that this film wo n't win anything in the festival where i saw it . in fact , two times during the film it seemed that it was finally over and people started to get up to leave ( this was one of the side effects of the cinematographer 's `` total darkness '' technique ) . but when the film shuddered on , instead , there were moans coming from the audience . and once the movie finally did end , it was clear that it had n't mattered if it actually had ended at either of the two earlier points . an earlier ending would have saved the audience from yet more monotonous scenes of domesticity ( folding sheets , cutting vegetables , spreading honey on bread ) . yeah , we get it , the life of the lonely old man was boring -- but we figured that one out at the very beginning . i recommend that audiences miss this one , it has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated movie-goers .
on steve irwin 's show , he 's hillarious . he does n't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie was n't even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he 's just saying 'oh , this is one nasty bloke ! ' and looking straight into the camera . he put his face in the camera too much ! and then when the guy falls off the car would n't you expect him to be dead ? and terri had the worst acting i 'd ever seen ! like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says 'steve ' . she did n't sound scared or anything , it was just 'steve ' . i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing . i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid .
all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure , but this is not the case . vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor . she was unbearable throughout the film . her tom-boy look does not really goes well . even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin . the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie . anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not . akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif . the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
i 'm not sure what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching , but enter the eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in hk action . michael `` fitz '' wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in hk , because he could n't act his way out of a wet paper bag in english . shannon lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter ( even better with the leg fighting than her dad ) , but her acting skills are also sub-par . in fact , all the english dialog ( 90 % of the movie -- even more than in gen-y cops ) is so bad that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs . sure , there are some decent gunfights ( but nothing we have n't already seen before ) and good cinematography , but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action . that said , it 's worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny `` the jet '' urquidez go at it . spectacular , and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for . finally , you might notice some scenes that seem `` familiar '' to you , notably a shootout at an outdoor market ( think matrix ) and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues ( think mi:2 ) . guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off .
robert altman 's downbeat , new-fangled western from edmund naughton 's book `` mccabe '' was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following . aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario , the characters here do n't merit much interest , and the picture looks ( intentionally ) brackish and unappealing . bearded warren beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel ; once the profits start coming in , beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action . altman creates a solemn , wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place , but the action in this sorry little town is limited -- most of the story being made up of vignettes -- and altman 's pacing is deliberately slow . there 's hardly a statement being made ( just the opposite , in fact ) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds . it 's a self-defeating picture , and yet , in an altman-quirky way , it wears defeat proudly . * * from * * * *
un-bleeping-believable ! meg ryan does n't even look her usual pert lovable self in this , which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick . hard to believe she was the producer on this dog . plus kevin kline : what kind of suicide trip has his career been on ? whoosh ... banzai ! ! ! finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill ? must be a replay of jonestown - hollywood style . wooofff !
if you are a fan of really bad movies , and you think there funny , you will the great acting of shaq . first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works . shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies . well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid . i would give this a zero but that is impossible .
the title alone ( along with the poster ) is enough to give away `` the projected man '' as an obvious rip-off of `` the fly '' . and bryant haliday , while much better than the typical imdb review would have you think , is nobody 's idea of an acceptable stand-in for vincent price . although , come to think of it , who would be , unless micheal gough was available ? ? still , if you are in the mood to watch a british `` hammer '' style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong ... well , you still might want to give `` the projected man '' a pass and rummage around in the 'remaindered ' bin at your local wal-mart for another teleporter-accident movie . because this one just is n't all that good . haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the mst3k crew for his part in this movie and in `` devil doll '' , but he is actually the best thing in tpm . maybe he ca n't carry the movie , but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay . the script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets ... or something . so all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats . then when poor haliday gets mutilated by his machine , he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various londoners who chance across his path . tom cruise and eric roberts using bullhorns could n't have made this screenplay work . meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project , but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole . the corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers , all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a tattersall vest . haliday 's research assistant and ex-girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of british horror cinema . his secretary is forced to parade around in her `` smalls '' . none of it really works or gels into a real movie . and it all just kind of stops dead , leaving the viewer going , `` eh ? excuse me , was n't there supposed to be an ending here ? ? '' still , for all its problems , i can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse , and so could anyone else who follows movies ( or who has ever browsed the imdb `` bottom 100 '' ) . i would n't actually pay money to own `` projected man '' , but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a dvd collection , i 'd probably feel ok about having it . it 's a harmless diversion , perfect for a horror movie film festival , to watched with friends while consuming many beers and snacks on a saturday evening .
when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film , i know it is bad . i wanted to claw my eyes out . i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had . this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to `` unwatch '' , if only it were possible . the other films being 'troll 2 ' and 'fast and furious ' , both which are better than this crap in the hat . i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name . to mike myers , i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world . just because it worked for jim carrey , does n't mean seuss is a success for all canadians .
i suppose if you like endless dialogue that does n't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _angel_ , you 'll enjoy the film . me ? all i wanted was a nice , tight little story , and it was n't there . the pacing was practically backward , plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue , and there was absolutely no sense of dread , or tension , or anything . is it the redneck ? is it the wendigo ? no , it 's a cameraman on speed . that 's not scary . it does n't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you 're scared by mtv . like those reviewers before me , i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience . terrible film .
one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . acting was terrible , both for the kids and the adults . most to all characters showed no , little or not enough emotion . the lighting was terrible , and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot ( in the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed , there 's 4 shots ; the sheriff and dad in the evening on their boat , jillian and molly in the evening swimming , the rest of the kids in the daytime * when it 's supposed to in the evening * at the river bank , and the doctor , beatrice , and simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat . ) the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff , cappy ( although , there 's a slip of character when the pulse detector * whatever that thing is when people die , it beeps * shows cappy has died , he still moves while it can still be heard beeping , and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually , then it shows the pulse again , and then he finally dies . ) i guess it 's not going to be perfect , since it 's an independent movie , but it still could be better . not worth watching , honestly , even for kids . might as well watch something good , like the lion king or toy story if you 're going to see anything you 'll remember .
the threesome of bill boyd , robert armstrong , and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers , a working gal who sells salt water taffy . with the outbreak of world war i , the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar . the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going , with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy ' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome . the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u-boat . these sequences are lively and well-filmed , but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy-drama with a flat ending . for fans of the stars only .
this movie starts out very very slow , but when the action finally gets started , it 's a little had to follow . i could n't understand why some of the events were taking place , and a lot of events happened before they were explained , making them sort of confusing . the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood/gore it has , although most times the special effects are lacking . blood looks like red kool-aid . skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks . again , the story has a sort of amateur feel to it , like the writer did n't take a long time to perfect it . i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script . i honestly wish i had n't watched it , not because of the gore , but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life . if you like extremely gory movies , this is for you , if not , stay away .
this may have been made for the hell of it , but it was most probably the worst film i 've seen in years , the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case ! ! ! i 'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too , i 'm glad i only rented . i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter , i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future , that is , if he is still in work . notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing , do n't buy it ! ! ! ! !
this collection really sucks ! i rented it , thinking i´d really would enjoy some good fighting . man this sucked ! quick flashy cuts , an extremely annoying speaker , and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened ( i´m thinking especially of jet li´s fight in fists of legend and jackie chan´s fight from drunken master 2 ) . and what´s the deal with those brawling streetfighters ? ! what´s so `` cool '' about that ? i´ve seen more interesting fights on martial law ! this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people . do not ever buy this film ! do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap ! instead , go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory !
this movie is absolutely pointless , one of the good esamples how malcom mcdowall never got one decent role after clockwork orange . this one may be one of the worst though . no story , crappy special effects , shot in 4:3/or even worse cropped on dvd , just avoid it ....
make up your own mind . personally i found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from stevie wonder . no offense mr. wonder . maybe it is comedy , but i just found it stupid . not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids ; wheeler ( seann william scott ) and danny ( paul rudd ) , two energy drink salesmen , to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by gayle sweeny ( jane lynch ) . one of the misfits is ronnie ( bobb ' e j. thompson ) , a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is augie ( christopher mintz-plasse ) , a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world . wheeler and danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life , love and heavy metal . lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies . supporting are : elizabeth banks , ken jeongg , kerri kenney-silver , amanda righetti and david wain .
first : i bought it at the video store . second : i watched it . third : it was boring . fourth : it was not funny . fifth : most of the antics were lame . and last , but not least : it 's not only a bad movie , it 's a total fiasco . i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film . i pity it because it was his first movie . even if you are a huge adam sandler fan , do n't bother watching this movie . instead , just take the video , board a yacht , and throw it overboard .
up until the last 20 minutes , i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan 's worst movie ( excluding his pre-1978 work , which i am not familiar with ) . the final fight sequence changed all that : it is long and good and intense - indeed , one of the highlights of chan 's career . but to get to it , you have to sit through a lot of `` comedy '' that might amuse five-year-olds ( oh , look ! someone threw a tomato at that guy 's face ) and endless `` football '' scenes . not to mention the dubbing ( which includes the line `` how can i turn it off ? it 's not a tap '' - watch to find out what it refers to ) . `` dragon lord '' is worth renting for the final fight alone , but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors , and even then only for those who 've already seen at least 15 of his other movies . ( * * )
i had some expectation for the movie , since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of akshay and saif . well , i was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for dhoom franchise because i hated dhoom 2 ; but if dhoom 2 is compared to tashan , i would say dhoom 2 is very realistic . when i saw the credits at the beginning , i felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . well , the very first scene itself pis * ed me off . then , the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . it was like akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns ! phew ... you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are . the other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . it reminded me of some of the early 80 's movies . well , the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy kareena , who looked really hot in this one.and for that , i give a rating of 2 out of 10 . guys , please .. please ... do n't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . well , you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes . thats all .
dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise : a young mafia would-to-be killer ( chandler ) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service so he goes to california to take some lessons with a very known professional killer ( beluschi ) . first and most important task : to kill a young woman ( lee ) that is a completely strange for all of them . but is she a easy target ? the movie goes on and on based upon this principal idea but the result is just bad routine ; even the weird twist at the end does not save the movie . good performance by chandler . i give this a 4 ( four ) .
we expected something great when we went to see this bomb . it is basically a broadway play put on film . the music is plain terrible . there is n't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie ? you wo n't because there are n't any . some of the musical numbers go on so long that i got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when i got back ! if they were good songs well -- but they suck . the pace is slow , terrible character development . the lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand . this movie has nothing to offer anyone but die-hard broadway enthusiasts . this is without a doubt the most over rated movie i 've seen in my entire life . a complete waist of time and money . there is nothing memorable about this movie except danny glover -- who was n't on screen enough and whose character was n't developed enough . rent the video and you 'll agree -- this movie was an expensive , over produced , polished dog do .
i love the munna bhai mbbs but `` lagge raho ... '' sux really sux . i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life . and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers ? ? * * may be spoiler * * an educated girl needs an advice from a bhai , people discussing their personal prob . on phones come on man from which part of the world u r ? ? ? i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible . 2 out of 10 . ( 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting )
words can not describe how utterly abysmal this movie is . it is a series of random , unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady ( really disturbing ) . the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco , the best actor in this movie . also , it is rated nc-17 , shunning away the only people that might tolerate it .
adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they 're two different mediums . do you think it 's a great idea to make zulu into a stage play ? imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping `` blimey there 's thousands of them out there `` great movie and a bad stage play in order for a stage play to make great cinema there 's two essentials needed 1 ) a fine cast that creates on screen chemistry 2 ) great dialogue on paper cher and chazz palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . the story revolves around a hit-man played by palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . i was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which ca n't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . since the story is very static it 's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of the conversation revolving around sex acts . if you want to see a great translation of a stage play transferred to the silver screen give faithful a miss and watch 12 angry men instead
i 'm a huge randolph scott fan , but this film is a dud . the whole thing has a canned , fake , soundstage feel to it , with truly awful rear-screen projection . it has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script , which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters . the directing is pedestrian , and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it . i 've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable `` soundstage productions '' before , but this is not one of them . all it does is make you appreciate the gritty scott/boetticher films all the more . randolph scott is tanned , trim , and shines that million dollar smile throughout . he 's always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films . aside from scott , the other main reason i wanted to see this movie was due to how much i enjoyed ms. wymore in errol flynn 's movie , `` rocky mountian '' . in `` man behind the gun '' , she is just as beautiful , and you can tell she 's a good actress , but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines , and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful . i 've only seen phil carey in `` operation pacific '' , and he plays the exact same character here ... an arrogant pain-in-the-butt you want to beat into unconsciousness . i guess it proves he 's a good actor ... he made me hate him . there are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film , in my opinion . although there are many elements to knock , i must say that i found myself truly enjoying the two spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but that 's not why we go to see randolph scott movies , right ? there are definitely worse scott films out there , and this one certainly is n't unbearable , but it also certainly could n't be deemed anything beyond mediocre .
is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television ( or the media in general ) as the 1960s ? no . and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time ? not really . but if we must have one , does it have to be as shallow as `` the '60s '' ? i like to think that co-writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted , especially given couturie 's involvement in the superb hbo movie `` dear america : letters home from vietnam '' which utilized little original music and no original footage , letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves . this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production , but it does n't do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time ; like so many of its ilk , it 's seen from the point of view of one family . but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the '60s ( it 's amazing that one of them does n't go to the rolling stones gig at altamont ) , making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade . the makers rush through it so much that there 's little or no time to give the characters any character , with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children 's father is especially clichéd - and then when they 're back on blammo ! it 's something else . garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly . in fairness , jerry o'connell , jordana brewster , jeremy sisto , julia stiles and charles s. dutton give their material the old college try , but they 're wasted ( especially the latter two ) ; it 's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton , and rosanna arquette ( in an uncredited cameo in part 2 ) is always welcome . what is n't welcome is how `` the '60s '' drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect ( and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post-60s america never mentions the british invasion - no beatles , no rolling stones ... then again , there 's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album , right ? ) . capping its surface-skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out-of-place happy ending , `` american dreams '' and `` the wonder years '' did it all much , much better . nothing to see here you ca n't see elsewhere , people ... except for julia stiles doing the twist , that is .
i 've never really considered myself much of `` student '' when it comes to watching films , i watch them , form an opinion and that 's it . but unhinged changed all this . this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i 've ever seen . every kid who rocks up at university thinking they 're gon na be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled `` how not to make a film '' . not only is there no story to be had , the film makers were n't even competent enough to make a film worth watching . it 's been a while since i saw it , but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes . they are never ending ! it 's almost like having your teeth pulled , only not as much fun .
ok i 'm not an american , but in my humble scottish opinion steve martin is not , never has been , and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction . phil silvers as sergeant bilko was a funny man , no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies america has ever produced . how anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the phil silvers character is beyond me . to compound things the exercise was repeated in martin 's unfunny attempt to be peter seller 's inspector clouseau , another abortive attempt , in my opinion , to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career . some of your contributers say 'steve martin puts his own stamp on the character ' , to that i would say 'balderdash ' , his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of silvers and sellars will be treasured for generations to come
it was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words , yet very naive on the corporate world . the justice department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win . the real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting , yet every bit as sinister . i seriously doubt any corp would actually kill someone directly ; even the mod is more indirect these days . in the real world , they do kill people with nicotine , pollution , additives , poisons , etc . this movie must have been developed by some garage geeks , i think , and the studios did n't know the difference . they just wanted something to capitalize on the microsoft antitrust case in the news .
wowwwwww , about an hour ago i finally finished watching this terrible movie ! ! ! i wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but i figured i 'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better . or at least have some redeeming qualities , like i figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie , or like really intelligent , or very well filmed or something ... needless to say , that was not the case and i wasted about an hour and a half of my life . im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this `` may contain spoilers '' ... imdb , you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that . i thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and i was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings ... all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some completely different movie ... im still a big imdb fan , but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3 .
a female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood . she has an assistant who does n't want to be a vampire , so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker . after a few kills , the assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl . what can i say about this movie ? that its pacing is over-slow , that it has some strange sound effects ( never a bite sounded so strange ) and ambiance ( new jazz here i come ) and that lights do n't seem to be included on the set . it looks like an `` auteur '' horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside . the plot is completely stupid and as you can guess , it 's the female vampire who explains how to kill her even if she does n't have to do it ; of course , crosses , light , garlic and sticks do n't work . it 's not even a funny lousy movie . perhaps with some friends and a lot of beers , it ca n't have its funny sides ( to be honest , it 's funny during 10 - 15 minutes near the end of the movie ) . do n't be fooled by the troma sticker , it 's one the bad movie they present .
like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously , i 'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went ' , `` yea ! ! ! this is it . this is the next film we are going to green light ! ! '' and whoever that person is , should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity . because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script , well , i 'd love to give you my email address and maybe you 'd like to just give away some more money . this film is atrocious in every way . the wayans are funny , at least they can be . they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way . but in here , not only does the premise defy all logic , not only is the acting terrible , not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish , not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find , but they actually want you to pay to see this film . maybe if it was free ... naaah , it would still be a waste of time . usually i 'd be inclined to write some long winded , detailed review about why this film is so bad , but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking . this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack . 0/10 .. makes my top ten list of worst films of all time !
if you want to checkout a good jason scott lee film , i recommend the following : dragon : the bruce lee story rapa nui `` timecop 2 : the berlin decision '' is an awful film . awful production values . awful acting . awful script . i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood ( this film does neither. ) . i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing . if you are curious , perhaps a rental from netflix , but this film is definitely not for keeps . if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness , and came away disappointed , then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing . these are well-written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors : better luck tomorrow mulan
this film is awful . not offensive but extremely predictable . the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60 's . the father , the principal at the school , is going through a mid-life crisis . enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students ' minds with some thought-provoking stuff , like think for yourself . the principal does n't agree with her teaching but she is pretty . you can connect the dots . his teenage daughter ( winona ryder wannabe tara frederick ) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live . she gets some bad advice , hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning was n't being taught at her school . shocking ! seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv , this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms .
i went into this movie hoping for the best . i like wartime musicals in general . dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles ; however , the writers gave them boring dialog . the love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth ; just suddenly it was there . i did not think much of the music ; the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with `` der fuhrer 's face . '' the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy ; pretty tame stuff , even with the monkey . bert lahr 's comedy skits were interminable . there were parts to enjoy : lucille ball was quite a looker , and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen .
i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection . the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features . my vote for this movie is a big fat zero . do n't misunderstand , i 'm a horror girl . but i want some meat behind the story , not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans , not to be tricked in to watching , what seemed like forever , clips of animal snuff . acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting . if i was forced to make a comparison to another film , the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust . bad , boring , pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch .
the first in the series was brilliant , easily one of the best horror films of all time . this is the crappiest . when i sat down to watch this , i was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were , this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones . boy was i wrong . incredibly wrong . when i watched the first ten minutes of it , i was actually really tempted to turn it off , but i thought no , maybe it 'll improve . it did n't . not only is this just a dire film by itself , it did n't need another sequel , because the last two ( fourth and fifth ) had already been terrible enough ! also , how many times can you bring freddy back ! ? the acting in it was terrible , the story-line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well . the way they made springwood was just totally wrong . pays no respect to the first one at-all . to add to this , the whole thing seemed really over-the-top . some people are saying that this film was `` funny '' . this film is not `` funny '' at all . since when is freddy krueger supposed to be `` funny '' ? i would call it funnily crap . this film is supposed to be a horror film , not a comedy . if freddy had a daughter , would n't that information have surfaced like in the first one ! ? the ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy , exactly like the rest of it . this one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one . just shows itself up . such a shame that wes craven created something so good in the beginning , yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin . they should n't have even bothered making this film . nor any of the other sequels , except the third one . the third one 's the only decent one out of all the sequels . if this was a dvd by itself and not part of the nightmare on elm street dvd set that i got , i would have chucked it out when i got it . summary : a pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel . - a complete mockery of the first film so please , do n't waste your time on this worthless junk .
go immediately and rent this movie . it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust . no one will have touched it in years . it may even be a $ .50 special ! it 's worth ten bucks , i swear ! buy it ! there are n't very many films than can compare with this - the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years . yes , i gave it a ' 1 , ' but it really deserves much lower . 1-10 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind .
painful to watch , and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters . two of the main characters , cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter , spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively . their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable . it was n't worth the wait . i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view .
this movie . . . i do n't know . why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin , i will never know . why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects , then not bother to edit it properly , i will never know . why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period , and sometimes bizarrely not , why they commissioned such bad songs , why the script does n't make any sense whatsoever ( not even on a silly , children 's film level ) . . . . what were they thinking ? ? nothing about this movie is quite as it should be . every single part is dubbed ( and always poorly , ) every sound effect is slightly wrong , every edit is in the wrong place , every performance is bad in some way . it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere , despite all the problems , but it never captures the magic that is astrid lindgren 's creation .
he pulled the guys guts out his butt ! that 's a spoof right ? ! no one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong . i think any way . this movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise . can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard . director says , `` next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor . get this , he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole '' `` brilliant ! '' the entire cast proclaims . no way can that happen , nobody writes that stupid ! got ta be a spoof . i loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave . i was n't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much . maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk . seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door . what the heck is that richard greco guy doing in this ? did he fire his agent or something ? can anyone explain the ending to me please because i did n't get it either ? i ca n't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea . never mind i do n't want to know .
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine , moronic idiots . the men get stoned/drunk , and then they yell/beat each other up in almost every scene . the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a ruckus , or worse , milling around like mesmerized cattle . apparently , canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks . it 's the standard knocked-up girlfriend , her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before . every character here is a carping , infantile stereotype . not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower ! and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt  shudder  is enough to make anyone gag ! i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i can not understand why he would have accepted a role like this . maybe he needed the money . ian tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague redeeming moment , but his talent is wasted here . as for the rest of the plot  the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back  yawn - or karl  who is dead , but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind ( almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock 's masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films ) , why even bother ? karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying . by the end of this wretched movie , i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat !
the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.yes remakes are n't all bad but remakes directed by jion da bont definitely are.i suppose that the a-list actors ( liam neeson , catherine zeta jones , owen wilson ) are there to distract us from the boring plot , ridiculous special effects , and terrible attempts at scaring it 's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we do n't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.the storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever 's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.the characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you do n't really care about any of the characters at all.lily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she 's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.lily taylor is n't made for the horror genre at all.the ghosts are stupid and cheesy , they look like a bunch of casper the friendly ghost 's and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with a smoke machine.there is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it 's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.the house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that does n't save it from it 's brutal everything else.i can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i would 've been even more pi $ $ ed if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channel.overall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects , a poor attempt at horror .
it was a disappointment to see this dvd after so many years . for me the main problem 's the uneven script . while some of it is witty and hip , quite a bit of it is dull , unfunny and lifeless . many of the gags just sit there , lacking spark and energy . of the cast , mae west and rachel welch come over well . roger herren in the role of rusty shines ( too bad he did n't make more films ) . but for my money , there 's just too much of john huston , and poor rex reed is n't hardly given a fighting chance . his character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines , wondering what he 's doing in this film . the low user rating should give an idea as to the public 's opinion of this piece . vidal 's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted . not even the 'classic ' film clips did much . all in all a rather sub par effort , and it 's not likely to get much better with time .
i personally found this movie to be terrible , first it was hardly objective , and provided one side of the debate . the only people who were presented as the side saying he did exist being a bunch of people coming from a billy grahm revival . secondly it deviated heavily from its supposed topic did jesus ( yeshua ) exist , to talking about how violent christianity is , and showing scenes from mel gibsons `` the passion '' . in the end it has the director con his former principal of a conservative private school into being interviewed , and attempts to trap him about teaching the kids there faith . oh and also the techno music just made the film harder to watch .
yes , this is one of those movies , so terrible , so insipid , so trite , that you will not be able to stop laughing . i have watched comedies , good comedies , and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie . the other comments give the idea well enough . the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on , the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge , the acting -- oh the acting -- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses . but the rat , yes , the big rat . why we did n't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me . often the 'big one ' is n't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money . i surmise , however , that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry . the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene . after figuring out that the rats could n't stand loud noise ( migraines from the bad acting ? ) , the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy . if you 've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser , this film is for you . really , you need to rent it and see for yourself . but not for more than 99¢ , ok ?
this movie was awful . i had a very difficult time watching this all the way through . i did n't get the point of the movie . what was the point of this movie ? the soundtrack was bad , acting was bad and the story uninspiring . the two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting . there was no chemistry among any of the cast members . i do n't know this for a fact , but i suspect that most of the actors were first timers . the movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot . that indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie . i would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie . i want those two hours back ! if you want to watch good , funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons , watch napoleon dynamite instead .
the bfg is one of roald dahl 's most cherished books , but in this animated adaptation the magic just is n't there . this version remains pretty faithful to dahl 's original story so one ca n't lay the blame on john hambley 's script . if anything the fault lies with the colourless animation , the lethargic pace and the generally lacklustre voice-overs . one would be right to expect this story to make for a happy , vibrant , fun-filled movie ..... instead , the film is a hopelessly dull affair that becomes quite tedious to watch . children who are not familiar with the story should definitely read the book first ! all the film will achieve is to put them off read what is actually a children 's ' classic . young orphan sophie ( voice of amanda root ) lives in a none-too-friendly orphanage under the cruel supervision of mrs clonkers . one evening she is peering through the window when she spots a massive figure walking stealthily down the village street . the figure realises it has been seen , so it reaches in through the window and scoops sophie from her bed , placing her into its enormous pocket before fleeing into the night . sophie soon discovers that she has been kidnapped by a giant from giant country , and fears that he will eat her . but to her relief he turns out to be a kind and sensitive member of his species who introduces himself as the bfg ( voice of david jason ) . the bfg refuses to eat people , instead restricting himself to foul-tasting vegetables known as snozzcumbers . however , giant country is populated by numerous other giants who do feast - every night , as it happens - on poor unsuspecting humans . sophie and the bfg become great friends , and soon they come up with a plan to thwart the other giants . together they go to the queen of england ( voice of angela thorne ) with their remarkable story and beg her to send the army and the air force to fight the man-eating giants . the queen agrees and so begins a dangerous operation to capture the bad giants before they can harm anyone else . jason voices the bfg quite well ( one of the few pluses in the film ) but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality . the rest of the voice work is decidedly uninspired , with very little to bring the characters to life . similarly , the bfg is the only character that is imaginatively animated - sophie lacks appeal , and the giants are boringly designed ( and look almost indistinguishable from each other ) . even the places are uninventive ; giant country especially comes up short , being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rocks and canyons . at 88 minutes the film is not exactly lengthy , yet it drags quite badly in parts due to the soporific handling of several sequences . little of dahl 's mischievous humour is conveyed satisfactorily . one chapter in the book deals with the bfg 's love of `` whizzpopping '' ( farting ) and is laugh-out-loud hilarious . in the film , the same section is totally killed by unfunny handling . i came to the the bfg expecting lots of zest , fun and enjoyment , but what i got was pretty much the opposite ! this one is a failed misfire that simply does n't match the calibre of the book in any department - unfortunately , therefore , it must go down as one to skip .
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world , the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .
extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel . what was even worse was marlon brando 's performance . his southern drawl was ridiculous . i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost . brando , so great in previous films , was reduced here to a laughing stock . tyrone power , in `` witness for the prosecution , '' should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here . the film , dealing with racism , dealt with the u.s. government 's attempt to avoid marriages between u.s. soldiers and japanese women . brando was stone-faced throughout the movie . his moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman . his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views . only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances . nothing about either performance was equally impressive . umeki 's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part . a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka , who did nicely as brando 's love interest . she showed great emotion as the anti-american who found love with the brando character . her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 . she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living . martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in `` the ten commandments '' to the bigoted mother of brando 's love interest at first . her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted . patricia owens , as brando 's first love , showed depth and conviction in her performance .
i have absolutely no knowledge of author phillipa pearce or any of her novels and if tom ` s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . when i was a child i wasn ` t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count judging by this film version of tom ` s midnight garden i guess pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn ` t have in the 1950s so i guess there ` s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . there ` s also a romance involving a young girl called hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative this is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . it ` s inoffensive but i ` m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters . i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who ` d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy ?
i did n't expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend . it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out . still , i held out hope . it sounded a bit much like `` bride and prejudice '' ( l.a. guy falls for an indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah ) . b & p was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters . `` my bollywood bride '' had none of that . the acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers . characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student . technically , the sound really bothered me . it seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue . i mean a lot . i know sometimes it 's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting . two stars is being somewhat generous .
ming the merciless does a little bardwork and a movie most foul !
wow , my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not excepted . i will try to tone this one down . lets be real ! ! ! no one wants to see a chuck norris movie where he is not the main character.there was a good fight scene at the end , but the rest of the movie stank . i have to wonder if old chuck just ca n't hang with the best any more . has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out junk like this and hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie ? chuck is an awesome martial artist , and as we have seen from walker , texas ranger , a fairly good actor , but the trick is to combine both of these qualities in his movies , and this one does not . very disappointing for us norris fans . chuck , stay as the main character in your movies , because this does not work for you ... gary
i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever . perhaps if the only chinese movies you 've seen contained no dialogue , long drawn-out far-away stares and silences , and hack editing , then you 're spot on . complicated story-line ? hardly . try juvenile and amateurish . exquisite moods and haunting memories ? hardly . try flat-out boring and trite . this was awful . i could not wait for it to be over . particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of `` how are you ? i 'm fine . are you sure ? yes . '' wow ! what depth of character . i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them . as a huge fan of many chinese , japanese and korean films , i was totally disappointed in this . even zhang 's sentimentally sappy `` the road home '' was better than this .
the problem with `` the killer elite '' is that just by seeking this film out , and investing time to watch it , you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did , particularly director sam peckinpah . the already volatile peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film . according to at least one biographer , this was where he became acquainted with cocaine . add to that his binge drinking , and it 's no wonder things fell apart . it 's a shame , because the concept behind the film is a good one , and the first ten minutes promise much . mike locken ( james caan ) and george hansen ( robert duvall ) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the cia . they move quick , live well , and seem like the best of friends - then something happens to shatter their brotherhood . an opening scene shows them blowing up a building - why exactly we are n't told , par for the course in terms of this film 's murky motivation . but the implication is these guys hurt people and do n't really care - antiheroes much like the wild bunch of peckinpah 's not-so-long-ago . an opening title tells us they work for comteg , then adds with obvious tongue in cheek `` ... the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is , of course , preposterous . '' that 's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are off . add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah backup cast , including burt young , gig young , and peckinpah regular bo hopkins in the plum role of a madman who ca n't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for $ 500 a day , and you only wish that the scriptwriters , including the celebrated sterling silliphant , tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs . an attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in . `` you 're so busy doing their dirty work , you ca n't tell who the bad guys are , '' someone tells locken , as if either he or we need it pointed out . worse still are peckinpah 's clumsy direction and sluggish pacing . we 're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene , a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we have n't even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport , their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suite . by the end of the film , what 's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed victory ships , ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense . `` lay me seven-to-five , i 'll take the little guy , '' he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from china , which we all know is the land of the ninja . ( the battle takes place in san francisco , but surprisingly no mounties arrive to break things up . ) caan is much better in smaller scenes , like when locken , recovering from some nasty injuries , is told by one of his bosses , played by a smooth arthur hill , that he 's been `` humpty-dumped '' by the organization . caan refuses to stay down , and his recovery scenes , though momentum-killing for the movie , feature fine acting from him and amy heflin , van 's daughter , as a supportive nurse . caan was one of the 1970s ' best actors , and his laconic byplay with heflin , duvall , hopkins , and both youngs give `` killer elite '' real watchability . but you do n't watch `` killer elite '' thinking about that . you watch it thinking of the film that got away .
this movie was horrible . they did n't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly . it was a definite sleeper . you 'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d-wars surprises you with even a let down in that department . also , the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick . and i seriously mean that . i was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad ! ! ! please , whatever you do people , do n't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-wars .
`` fly me to the moon '' has to be the worst animated film i 've seen in a long time . that 's saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now . the story is to be generous ... trite . the voice acting is atrocious , too cute sounding . the humor is of the romper room variety . the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television . it gets a 2 only because of it 's ok 3-d visuals . some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but we 've seen much better in the past . i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes . while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time . it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators . i will say this though , it had a pretty cool soundtrack . and for the record my son was n't too crazy about it either . bad movie .
this film is `` riveting '' but in much the same way a car crash is riveting . it 's hard to look away . overall , this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment -- and a futile , biased experiment at that . the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator . the manner in which the money is presented to ted is pure exploitation . the intervening steps that the filmmakers force ted to participate in ( meeting with so-called experts ) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with ted . instead , it 's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker 's posteriors and to further exploit ted 's situation . the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after 6 months ; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before . if they had cared , they would have found better `` experts '' to help ted . if they truly wanted to see what ted would do , then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention . this film is at best a high-brow jackass stunt and not a documentary . it 's sad to think how much $ 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person 's life had it been put in the right hands .
i have n't seen the first two - only this one which is called primal species in england . i do n't think i 'll be bothering to look them out though . this is an awful film . terrible acting , bad dialogue , cheap rubber monsters . everything about it is so nasty . the most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones , especially one called polchak , who is an incredible jerk . no-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army . he lasted for ages but i was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - i was having nightmares he was going to survive . the colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting . and the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno . i was waiting for her to take her glasses off , shake her hair and turn into a vamp , but she did n't . pity that , as it would 've livened the film up no end . did n't roger corman used to make half decent films once ?
this is the worst movie ever made . the acting , the script , the location , everything ! i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie , but even they were bad . you would think that a movie with the word `` beach '' in it 's title would have good-looking women in it . would n't you ?
this series had potential , but i suppose the budget would n't allow it to see that potential . an interesting setup , not dissimilar to `` lost '' it falls flat after the 1st episode . the whole series , 6 episodes , could have made a compelling 90 minute film , but the makers chose to drag it on and on . many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward . the music was very annoying and did not work overall . there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame -- - well , one grew a bit . the ending was as terrible as the rest of series . the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers , they created an interesting look , too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
i am a dumber person for renting the dvd redline . chicago pictures who made this stupid movie never paid palisades media group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an alexa rating of 16k . they ripped me off on the deal and now i am out $ 16,000 and they wasted much of my personal time ( peter rapport of palisades media ) you know who you are ! please do n't rent or buy this movie ! ! ! it sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists . redline has a cast of losers and poor actors ! this movie is a joke
something to sing about was produced at grand national studios where james cagney was working while under a contract dispute with the brothers warner . he did two films for this b studio , neither of which rank high in the cagney credits . one of the great losses to cinema is the fact that jimmy cagney did so few films that utilized his terrific dancing abilities . the two that come to mind immediately are yankee doodle dandy and footlight parade . two lesser films are the west point story and never steal anything small . cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement . so why did he make so few of them ? well this one was all wrong . the plot of something to sing about concerns a hoofer who fronts for a band who 's discovered and given a movie contract . there are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent played respectively and well by gene lockhart and william frawley . his contract calls for a no- marriage clause , so cagney and band girl singer lady evelyn daw marry in secret . then we get the complication of a publicity driven studio romance with screen leading lady mona barrie . i think you can figure where this is going . the most disappointing thing about something to sing about is the lack of dance numbers for cagney . he dances briefly at the beginning and the end of the film and nothing in the middle . evelyn daw had a nice singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich . she got the musical numbers such as they were . i 'm sure the movie-going public was paying their tickets to see cagney dance . also in addition to giving him some dance numbers a female dance partner would have been nice . he danced well with ruby keeler in footlight parade and with virginia mayo and doris day in the west point story . were n't ginger rogers , eleanor powell or ruby keeler available ? no memorable songs came out of this . and daw 's voice is waisted as well . she has a jeanette macdonald soprano voice which was so out of place with a swing band . no wonder cagney went running back to warner brothers . but they should have given him some decent musicals .
in one word : excruciating . i was advised to read some articles about this film 's philosophical meanings afterward , but , having sat through the movie 's interminable 115 minutes and being slowly crushed beneath its bloated symbolism and lava-flowing oppressiveness , it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie . after all , who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand ? and this flick was dismal . lead actor claude laydu , from the film 's opening to its end , wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the film 's eternal , dreary voice-over . filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both , as they basically say the same thing : the priest of ambricourt is a wretched human being . the story , about a persecuted priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family , does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic , as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos , and the priest , himself , comes across as a nosy pest . the last 30 minutes suggests some breath-taking message about grace and one man 's suffering equaling that of others , but due to all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering laydu and the vague subtext in robert bresson 's script , all i felt was , finally , it 's over , let 's have some ice-cream . interesting for fans of bresson fanatic paul schrader , just to see how many elements of character and setting schrader carried into in his own scripts and movies , especially `` taxidriver '' , `` raging bull '' and `` light sleeper '' .
could contain spoilers ..... i 'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest .. really am . all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say . ( note to self must check the rating for platoon on here ) this movie was so black and white ... americans good ... anyone else either evil or useless . i take it the british troops in it were meant to be sas ( one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with i 'm pretty sure ) they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the us troops who were n't even elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky iraqis . aye dead-on strings to mind . the only good thing i have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the sas man ... muzzle flash from distance , good noise used ... really well done that bit but the rest ... spare me what am i 10 years of age over here ? ? ! ! well i 'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it . spoiler ... oh aye and in the main crazy , wild guy ca n't stay at home with his wife and young child .. no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war ! ! why ... because young men need thrills or something apparently . like say i 'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am . p.s . i 'm not hating america i 'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war ( in my eyes ) which ok fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it 's a just war for whatever messed up reason ( wanted to say something else her but censored ) but hey that 's up to them . but to churn out a movie so one-sided like it 's black and white ... good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child . in war there is a lot of grey and it 's two ( sometimes more ) sides who believe in what they are fighting for . not star wars with something something dark side verses the goodies . f ' sake hollywood at times you really do take people for mugs ... then again 7.8 .... well maybe you are right to but i 'll not be buying it . glad i downloaded this movie tell you all that for nothing . ; )
i 'm a true fan of the original cracker series , and own all of them on dvd . cracker had a tendency to be over-the-top on occasion , but robbie coltrane and the other cast members , as well as the writers , always seemed to carry it off despite themselves . i count the original cracker among the great brit tv crime series of that time , and there 's some stiff competition : prime suspect , inspector frost , inspector morse , jeremy brett 's sherlock homes , and a host of others . cracker , along with prime suspect , was on the top of my list . which makes `` a new terror '' all the more sad ... ultimately , this was a very pale imitation of cracker 's former glory . i forced myself to sit through the whole thing , convinced that it could n't actually be this bad , and that some spark would eventually ignite . i was wrong , it was bad from beginning to end . a few criticisms : first , just to get any potential bias up-front right off : i was offended by the anti-american , anti-war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show . the topper : the murder of two american 's innocent of any crime and a british junkie is , in fitz 's words , `` understandable , but not justified '' . i thought `` i waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel ? '' so i had a negative reaction to the anti-war/american tone brought on by my beliefs ... beyond the politics , i had the distinct sense that this cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda , and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script . second , just how much air-time did robbie coltrane get ? fitz was almost a bit player in this one , as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of fitz 's role . coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders , but the writer was apparently thinking of other things , and missed the chance , and by a wide margin . third : what an abysmal script ! there was some sparkle , and a couple of bits of actual character development ( fitz 's son ranting that fitz could n't stay at his house if he missed his plane to australia , the detective that liked to beat his poor-performers over the backs of their heads , and some of the old sparks between fitz and his missus ) but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline . fourth , where the hell was panhallagan ? now that would have been interesting ... it was manchester after all , and 10 years on she 'd be up in the ranks . another wasted opportunity ( or perhaps the actress was n't interested ? ) well , there 's much more ( that 's bad ) to say , but i 'll close with a curiosity : at the end of the show ( as it aired on bbca ) , when the advertisement announced that the `` director 's cut '' was available on bbc on-demand , i thought ah-ha ! the director 's cut , which , presumably , one has to pay for , might have all of the goodies i expected to see tonight but never did , like a coherent , interesting storyline . unfortunately , after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of `` a new terror '' with the hope of seeing something , anything , worth watching , only to be disappointed , i have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second , potentially longer and more tedious version . besides , it angered me to think that bbca sliced and diced , and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless ( every ten minutes or so ) stream of commercials , and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight . to close , i quote the first paragraph of variety 's review of `` a new terror '' : it really says it all : `` initial excitement about robbie coltrane reprising his role as the bbc 's flawed , boozing , womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy-handed political statement writer jimmy mcgovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic . jolting at first in its message -- namely , that americans are a bunch of whiny namby-pambies who did n't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep -- mcgovern 's chest-clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing fitz back on the case . ''
bad movie for sure . it 's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects , a lot of hasty scenes ( the airport one for example ) , and a real unfunny time . ( charles dance ) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in ( last action hero ) . ( eddie murphy ) is doing a non-comic joking , and i heard that this sunk had already succeed , big time success ? ? ! ! i 'll never understand why or how ? ! in one tv interview i 've heard ( eddie murphy ) himself , when he was nominated for an oscar 2007 , regretted it in a comic way ! ! one of the comments said ( hey ... it 's the 1980s ! ) . well , no my friend . it 's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it 's the 1980s or the 1950s ! there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie . the first is that i 'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of ( charlotte lewis ) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house , wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be . but how odd ! as i 've watched her in following movies and she was n't that beautiful again ? ! ! anyhow the second reason is that i 've found this movie 's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever ! the bottom line : bad movie , greeeeeat legs .
what a preposterous story , murder blackmail , child sex allegations , gays and the catholic church ..... absolute tripe . how is it that most uk based tv dramas , sit coms etc have to include the obligortory gay , its really getting tiresome now . everybody accepts that there are gay people in society just has there are other minority groups , but we do n't want it ramming down our throats ( i 'll pass on this one ) in every single show . apart from the above , the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime , the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where , oh yes just to be totally pc one of the gay couple was black.i am surprised at c ecclestone for even contemplating this when he read the script .
a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers . the mystery is whether or not jane graystone ( nancy coleman ) has amnesia . the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr. ingersoll , a good doctor turned evil . he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane , coded information related to allied activities . will she tell ? can she remember ? moroni olson ( as mr. goodwin ) is convincing as an accomplice to massey . the role played by john garfield ( as dr. lewis ) is nothing short of disastrous . he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history . it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents . the movie is worth one look , despite being a half spy and half gangster film , and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters . it 's easy to forget this one , amnesia is not necessary .
adrianne , should really get a life-without mr. `` brady '' . she nauseates me , and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show . it 's pretty brainless show , and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death . this makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage , and yet , i know these disagreements are all part of life . i guess to some people this is entertainment . if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash . though i would not be terribly surprised . ca n't even stand the commercials for this show anymore ! i hope they 're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week . however , the `` a '' girl has one heck of great butt !
this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght , but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs . the characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story ( there 's actually no story either ) than looking for each other and kissing . it 's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity , and achieving true emotional resonance . on top of that , it pretends to be an `` art '' film by using the worst naive clichés of the cinematic snobbery . but anyway , if someone can identify with its heavy banality , i guess that 's fine .
when i saw that imdb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies , i thought it was too harsh but little did i know that the low rating was absolutely correct . i am a big fan of the wayans brothers . i loved their scary movie 2 and even enjoyed white chicks . little man , however , had very few laughs and the jokes were stale . obviously , the joke will revolve around marlon wayans , who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison . he and his partner , tracy morgan , steal a diamond meant for a gangster . things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by shawn wayans and kerry washington . in order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond . the movie has some actors and actresses from saturday night live like molly shannon and rob schneider as well from in living colour . all these talents , however , can not help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny . the special effects to make marlon wayans to look like a midget was ok . i mean , it was not 100 % believable but it was ok ... nothing great . i just wish that the wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses . wait for it on cable or television . it really is not worth any amount of money .
i rented end game , having never heard of it , but i 'm fond of political thrillers so i thought i 'd give it a shot . after doing some research on the movie , i found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release , but instead had gone strait to dvd . after seeing it , i 'm thinking , `` no wonder . '' the movie is shocking in its unoriginality . the plot and the characters are perfunctory . i figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball . i have to say , i did n't expect it to end quite the way it did , but that 's not a point in its favor . the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad . perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist -- even one that made the movie even worse . stay away . i want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back .
well , on it 's credit side ( if it can be said to have one ) , timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h.g . wells ' outstanding novella . but other than that - well , to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime . what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged $ 20 million dollar budget ! timothy hines really does make mr. wood , who was a flawed genius anyway , look like the best filmmaker of all time . the special effects ( i guess you 'd call them that ) are not even up to computer game standards . the acting is , well , perhaps about dinner theater comparable , and the accents are atrocious . at the risk of sounding offensive , a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is ( especially poor ogilvy ) , well , ahem , . . . gay ! poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside , waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor . hey , the stormtroopers in `` star wars '' had neat white body armor too , and it did n't work either , they still got blasted . even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians ' 'heat ray ' ( ? ) , they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance , even when they 're theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons , which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing . maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen , being left over from `` jason and the argonauts '' . or was it `` josie and the pussycats '' ? i dunno . the soldiers , presumably because they 're 'military ' , all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode , like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him . wow ! i loved it ! but the 'soldiers ' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war , or boer commandos ( which would be more or less correct for the period . perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines ? ) . oddly enough , the character of the curate looks exactly like he 's drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble , and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting . oh , yeah . mus n't forget the thunder child . in the book , the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram . it was meant to ram enemy ships . yet , it 's bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker-toy constructed martian war machines , with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak , and she sank . an ironclad warship like thunderchild could 've rammed the titanic and survived , but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own military . the costumes are all wrong , especially the british army and police uniforms , cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas . and timbo , in an obvious homage to western films of yore , has obviously set his movie in wild western england , because all his riders are using western saddles . the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre , and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky . on the credit side , and contrary to what one reviewer wrote , the only genuine , authentic feature of this thing is the artillery . the guns are not from the civil war , but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders , perfectly authentic to the period . so was the ammunition shown being used . but the artilleryman , who is a driver in the horse artillery , was not shown correctly driving his limber . you do n't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team , you ride the nearside wheel horses . the opening , using what i believe is authentic period film footage , is okay , and the score 's not bad . however , to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground , and it certainly did n't in 1898 . but growing up reading this novel , i am very disappointed . even more disappointed then i was at spielberg 's zillion dollar , special effects laden version . maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise , and vice versa . i have a lot more to say , but i 'll let it go at this for now : i wish somebody would make a good version of `` war of the worlds '' that 's faithful to the original . timmy 's vision is fine for a high school film class , or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student , and about as bad , which is about the best i can say for this thing , but that 's about it . oh , yeah . just where did the budget go ? and what happened to michael caine ? i 'd like to hear his comments ! i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo `` orson wood '' hines ' breathtaking , bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director 's ticket to cult stardom , because , i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie , which i did n't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me , with no malicious intent that i 've been able to determine . i must add here that i thought blackmoon 's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement , but an absolute , hysterically funny ( in a good way ) treat to watch . i find it hard to watch master timbo 's version after blackmoon . keep it up , tim ! make your own version of `` dune '' , now . it just awaits the hand of a master like you ! and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield ? forget it . it can not beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness ! hey get a life ! timbo is worse than the master ed wood ! i kid you not !
this movie is not funny . it just takes the d & d nerd stereotypes and amplifies them . all the main characters make less than 30k a year , they all live with their parents , they 're all socially retarded , and they have no luck with women . the jokes are horrible and unimaginative , such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on ( it was his wizard costume ) and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up ( oh how funny , he 's a nerd so he does n't know about sports ) . you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny . poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch , but obviously extremely cheap to make . i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo . i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime .
investigative reporter darren mcgavin ( as carl kolchak ) is back ; this time , he 's after `` the night strangler '' . once again , police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve , or want to cover-up , the supernatural angle . producer-director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding `` night '' , with understandably less success . mr. curtis assembles a fun supporting cast , included are `` dark shadows '' alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis . jo ann pflug ( as louise harper ) heads up a sexy collection of belly-dancers . and , although i 've never seen it mentioned anywhere , that must be roger davis as mr. mcgavin 's dining companion in an early scene , feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires ! * * * * the night strangler ( 1/16/73 ) dan curtis ~ darren mcgavin , jo ann pflug , simon oakland , wally cox
generally i do n't do minus 's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie . i thought uwe boll 's alone in the dark was the worst i 've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion ( stephen dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit ) . hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne , bloodrayne would win a oscar for best movie if they were competing . now to the plot , this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but they 've could have done better . the start looked ok but that 's it i had to fast forward most of it because the death 's where boring . i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths . i 'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this . sorry for rambling but there 's nothing good to say about it , because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this .. this .. thing of disaster . uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake . well sorry i could n't explain the plot ( if there was one ) but that was the best i could . now if you do n't mind i 'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life .... ok not for life
revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features . i 'm tired of people arguing that it 's not that bad , and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936 . i suspect this is n't true : it 's not like iq 's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades . the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today . why ? just try watching the first scenes , and count the pauses between things happening , the awful choice of when to cut to close-up , the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time . pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue : `` i 'm going to make some tea/go outside/read my book now . '' `` are you ? '' `` yes , i am . '' that sort of exchange happens several times . normally i would love that , being a huge fan of bad movies , but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines , and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away . this sort of disinterested , pot-boiling time-waster is far worse than energetic , imaginative mind-blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians . those who claim that this is `` better '' than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment . this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment : it 's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom . which is far worse .
from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper . `` cq '' tells a lame , disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures , a babe , and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick . i ca n't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making . ( d )
would n't it be great if not another teen movie actually put an end to all of these stupid , pointless , i 'm getting more sex than you are teen movies ? in a perfect world , yes . yet this one is even worse . this one is not humiliating for the stars , it 's humiliating for the distributor . all of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have no interest in seeing , yet it 's `` funny . '' devon sawa , who was actually good in final destination , is just plain dull in this movie . it makes you wonder if it 's being bad on purpose . grade : f
i just finished watching this movie . it was n't ridiculously bad , but i 'm really disappointed with it . i 'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this . it was marginally entertaining , but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making . monday , the writer was in charge ; tuesday , the director ; wednesday , the guy who gets the coffee ; etc . it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies , but only had the time and money to make one . someone else commented that the acting was really good , but i 'd have to disagree . then again , if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming , perhaps they 're better actors than i give them credit for . the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery ... something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure . it starts off like that , but then , out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone , or ... what was that other show that was n't as good ... a bad episode of the outer limits . my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out . there 's the evil guy with spiked white hair . there 's the love interest , who , when she first appears , the wind actually blows through her hair . seriously . once you realize it 's a christian movie , the end is also pretty easy to spot . the cinematography was poorly done , especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward . it was n't atrocious for most of the movie , but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady , praying , arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie .
the worst kind of film . basically , the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum 's security for several days . eh ? the plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery , assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current , which it would n't . it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter , but that system would n't fit into the case . sorry to be anal , but this is n't even close to being plausible . the rest of the film was n't a great deal better and i 'm left wondering why the budget could n't have been donated to charity or me .
i was n't really hoping for much when i went to see this . after mst3king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though , i was hoping for a similar experience here . unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously . do i care about jason 's problems ? i 'm sorry no . there are a legion ft13th movies that cover that anyway . at at then end of the day , he 's an undead serial killer , i 'm just not going to get that sympathetic . freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not , but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie , it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch ... only not funny .
i just did n't get this movie ... was it a musical ? no .. but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it ... was it a serious drama .... no the acting was not good enough for that . is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor .. definently not . i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie . the message on apartheid and the `` tribute '' to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted . but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse . see for yourself , but in fairness i hated it
i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop , but was disappointed on many levels . first of all , the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable . second , the setting , acting and story are not very authentic or believable . third , there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks . how about some originality ? third , there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity - if any . none seemd really central . overall , film was a great disappointment , but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile .
i find it rather useless to comment on this `` movie '' for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon.it 's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it . but since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian `` movie '' directed by lucian pintilie who insists to depict the so called `` romanian reality '' following the communist era ( 1990 to present days ) . under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others ( who lately find amateurish camera , lack of plot , lack of directorial / actors 's quality etc , noise etc . as being trendy and even art-like ) : watch & enjoy this `` movie '' ( as i know you will ) but do the other well intentioned imdb members a favor , do n't write an online review for it will misguide , irritate and in the end waste their time . on the other hand this movie ( among others ) has some value whatsoever , an educational one for it sets the example for : `` how not to make a movie . ''
supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter . i 'd say 95 % is fabricated . i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies , however , this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film , something i ca n't stand , and to top it off , the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b ! ch i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head . it 's too incoherent , too flashy and way too boring , it 's a who gives a crap kinda story , and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer 's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat 's life .
this film essentially deals with inspector gadget 's arch-nemesis doctor claw who has returned after many years to the now-peaceful city of metropolis . claw 's plan is to foil gadget once and for all by using a newer `` cooler '' crimefighter to help destroy gadget 's popularity . sadly the film fails miserably , the series was great , but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results . without the voice of don adams as inspector gadget it just does n't cut it anymore ; dr. claw is not only visually less frightening , but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold , than his original intimidating self . granted this is a children 's movie , but the plot is so painfully weak ( heaven forbid i mention the animation ) that it pales in comparison to the original series . someone has decided to updated penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed , she now has some quasi-punk rebellious clothing style and does n't play half the role that she did in the tv series . the gadgetmobile talks , as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire on talking cars . maybe i 'm just a kid who loved the show who 's grown up jaded , but i thought that the live-action version was more pain than i could bear , but now they go and spring this complete watering-down of the quality tv series on us . it 's more than i can take .
this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons . basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation . ( some of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the 1600 's ) obviously reincarnated . god is an impersonal force . animal life and plant life are all the same . ( this is pantheism ) . redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty . his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality . as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for $ 10.00 will show you how to start your own religion . as one famous prophet has said , `` use the force luke '' .
ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice , but he 's approached by stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult . so ben , his sister 's best friend and stefan travel to transylvania to put a end to this evil . this is incredibly awful b-grade stuff and i wondered how it even got released . it makes the original 'howling ' look like a masterpiece . what was christopher lee thinking , as this has to be his worst performance i 've seen . there was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film , ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from annie mcenroe , reb brown , marsha a . hunt and sybil danning ( not to forgot lee ) , cheesy fashion ( those sunnies ) , cheap and lame special effects , bad use of lighting , the humour ... if there was any , trashy 80s music ( with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing ) , werewolf 's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue . i thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny , but i was wrong . the positives were the location and settings of the film looked great , but that 's about it ... actually i 'll add sybil danning short stripping scene too . during the end credits the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film , which i beckon the question why ? an awful piece of mess , however at least it is n't boring . 1/5
i usually start by relaying the premise of the film , but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review , let me preface it by saying that i 'm someone who likes most films ( just check my other reviews ) . alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll , whose film right before this one was house of the dead ( 2003 ) . like alone in the dark , it was also a film adaptation of a video game . almost everyone hated it . well , i loved it . i even gave it a 10 out of 10 ! my point in stating this ( which will surely turn some readers off immediately ) is that if even i hated alone in the dark , there must be something wrong with it . the premise : who am i kidding ? attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united states ' budget , but here it goes anyway . some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe . the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the `` second world '' , which was evil in nature . the bad stuff wiped them out , but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key . later , some scientist/government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal , and specifically this tribe , decided to experiment on some kids , to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world . ( believe it or not -- everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film -- it 's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice-over also reading it to us ) . then , there was something about the kids being in an orphanage , but the government takes them back out , and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics , and there are super humans roaming around , and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on . in fact , the exposition never really stops . it 's like a neverending backstory from hell . there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films , maybe 25 . but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film . in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the superhumans , we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf , worms that invade your body and turn into snake-like aliens , tunneling worms underground , zombies , starship trooper-like wars , evil scientists , underground lairs , gold mines , spooky warehouses , impalements , big mostly unused museums , government conspiracies , golden trunks pulled out of the sea , nuns , explosions , complex backstabbing plots , a very ambiguous romance , car chases , home invasions , kitchen sinks . . . wait , i ca n't remember if that last one was in the film . even more amazingly ( amusingly ? ) , in fangoria # 240 , producer shawn williamson was quoted as saying , `` we 're spending much more time on story , being very meticulous about that '' . tara reid called alone in the dark `` a smarter film '' . let me not mislead anyone . a lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film , but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else . i usually had no idea what any setting 's relation was to any other setting , why we were there , or what anyone was doing ( at least when each scene began ) . it 's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés , as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers . then when he was done , he and editor richard schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice , then reassembled it by throwing the i ching . sometimes the film plays like an extended director 's reel ( which is a combination of short , varied , unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work ) , but perhaps that 's being too generous . i 'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel . just as i tend to at least like most films , i tend to like most actors and most performances . it 's very rare that i say that a performance was bad . well , tara reid was bad here -- and i 'm someone who usually likes reid . i do n't know what happened . for a large percentage of the film , they just move her around the set like a prop . they might as well have just bought a blow-up doll . that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings . maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that 's usually reserved for entertaining mother-in-laws . and speaking of that dialogue , a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla . by that , i mean that it 's a lot of pseudo-scientific gobbledy-gook . at least in godzilla films , there 's a campiness to it , because they know how ridiculous it is , and there 's a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something . just what stephen dorff and christian slater are doing here , besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents , is difficult to say . i ca n't say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance , although maybe slater at least saw the cigar . i think that 's unprecedented for me . still , i did n't give this film a 1 . there was some competent cinematography , even if boll and schwadel made mincemeat out of it , and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good . heck , even the novelette prologue was n't so bad . i actually thought the film had promise at that point . but this may just be the worst film i 've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more .
oh yes , sakura killers is a goofy , horrible ninja movie , make no mistake . but it 's also an incredibly enjoyable one . this is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one chuck connors , who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes . i suppose he 's supposed to be sort of an obi wan kenobi type ( `` the tough ninja-buster '' , the box copy exclaims ) but his 'wisdom ' is laughable . `` move without thinking '' ? ? ? my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation , not of supreme concentration . but really , his two aides , sonny and dennis , have such horrible dialogue that 'brooklyn ' , as we call the colonel , tends to shine in comparison . especially watch for dennis ' logic regarding the 'genetic splicing ' the sakura are involved with . if you know anything about cloning you will die laughing . and yes , this is a major plot point , folks . a terribly fun movie , sakura killers is a hard-to-find gem . i wo n't spoil the 'trick ' ending for you either , except that it 's a perfect set up for a sakura killers 2 . too bad chuck connors died . : - ( because he does have a the smoothest ways of blowing away ninjas .
designed only to annoy ( or amuse ) any self-respecting intelligent person . if the director 's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character , then it would have been okay , but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who 'd make a critique of america 's pro-marxist 60s movement , especially not a filmmaker from the 70s . there is so much idiotic dialog going on here , that sometimes i wondered if i was n't actually watching a comedy . you would n't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire  that 's how naïve the movie appears . spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious , inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons . but , i mean , are n't they all ? nice boobs , but s * * t for brains .
andy hardy meets debutante ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . characters andy hardy ( mickey rooney ) and judge hardy ( lewis stone ) were going to be front and center . the rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . the series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in . lewis stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of judge hardy in a sympathetic manner . the rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . mickey rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . andys ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . even after he returned as a veteran of world war ii service in love laughs at andy hardy ( 1946 ) his reaction to any 'teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile . in this film it is clearly illustrated . andy gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . this screen writing device was known as the 'idiot plot ' . a means of stretching a poorly written scenario . maybe it was less mickey rooneys ' fault then the director and the writers . most likely george b. seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control rooneys ' excesses . to see our overview of the entire series go to you 're only young once ( 1937 ) .
* * * review may contain some spoilers * * * i 'll make this review short and sweet . i bought this movie from best buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like kevin spacey and morgan freeman . how bad could it be , right ? well , it 's pretty bad . justin timberlake plays pollack , a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at edison 's police force . ll cool j is deed , a cop within the force on a special force team called f.r.a.t . ( first response assault tactics ) . he 's teamed with an `` on-the-edge '' bad cop named lazerov ( dylan mcdermott ) . in the opening scene we see lazerov & deed taking on some bank robbers , but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . i do n't want to give to much away , but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . pollack , who works for ashford ( morgan freeman ) goes to a trial involving deeds & lazerov . he suspect foul play and with the help of ashford , does some investigate that turns ugly . wallace ( kevin spacey ) who is all within the f.r.a.t . team joins with ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice . you can tell from the beginning that freeman and spacey 's performance are pretty lackluster . the only person that give a all out performance is dylan mcdermott . he is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . ll cool j is terrible in this film . he says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . he was much better in movies like deep blue sea & any given sunday . the film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . the ending is far from satisfying . do n't waste your time with this film . i 'm putting it on ebay this weekend .
yes i admit i cried during this movie . it was so incredibly disappointing , that i could n't help myself but cry . tbn ( trinity broadcasting network ) has done it again . first with having the million dollar man ( ex-professional wrestler ) on their program , and now this . the omega code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . it was quite amusing , yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . the movie follows what is known as `` the bible code '' rather than following actual biblical scripture . this film is extremely poorly made ; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . it appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the usa channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie . i highly recommend you do not watch this movie , even if your life depended on it .
i did n't know much about this movie before i watched it , but i heard it had something to do with quantum physics so i was interested . what i did n't know is that this is not actually a story but a bunch of new-age blowhards who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics . i say it belongs more in the documentary category than comedy or drama . marlee matlin is in the movie , in order to give this new age symposium * some * sort of a storyline . her portions of the film feel horribly tacked on and are meant to display the speaker 's thoughts so we wo n't die of boredom . matlin has a real job as a photographer , unlike the new age hippie that crashes on her couch . we get to listen to nameless people ramble on about what quantum physics all `` means '' to them . the one bright spot in this movie was the speaker from india ( i assume ) , but i think he showed up for the wrong film . it looks like barbara eden really let herself go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy new age beliefs . it looks like quark from ds9 was running low on cash and he also makes a brief appearance in the film . there is a lot of whizbang cgi we 're supposed to be impressed with ; cells in the body are shown as dancing jello molds , because the filmmakers have apparently seen flubber one too many times . people in the movie say that the arawak people on san salvador thought columbus 's ship the pinta was invisible because natives had never seen clipper ships before , as if people today had any way possible way of knowing . of course they leave out all of that information and just say `` columbus 's ships were invisible to the indians in america . '' the film takes many such arrogant leaps . thomas young did a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can look like a particle some of the time , and a wave some of the time . of course you 'd never * know * this from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that `` atoms can be particles and waves . '' and that must mean that people can pass through walls , walk on water , and never grow old if they just wish upon a star ! ! then i 'm sure marlee matlin could stop being deaf if she just * believed * hard enough . i 'm being sarcastic , but this film is chock-full of false hope and beliefs that the people espousing them do n't really hold . these are new age kooks who have grabbed onto quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation , zero point energy , crystal healing , etc . if these snake-oil salesmen truly believed the crap they were selling , could n't they just * wish * their paychecks into existence instead of appearing in this joke of a film ? we get to listen to another nameless man , with no credentials that we know of , talk on his couch in front of a fireplace ( or tv screen ) about how he creates his own life . every time he was on the screen i wanted someone to rush in and throw a pie in his face . these people take themselves way too seriously . some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever * really * touches anything because there 's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level . if only someone had walked onto the screen and kept punching him in the stomach , screaming `` i 'm not touching you ! i 'm not touching you ! '' a moral relativist in the movie claims that there 's really `` no such thing as good or bad . '' so apparently it 's ok that hitler gassed millions of jews to death ? another person says that there is `` no such thing as love . '' it 's just a chemical and that we really do n't love people , we 're just addicted to the chemical rush we have when we 're around them . i suspect this guy is doing this film as community service for being addicted to heroin for so many years . we are witness to a truly pathetic sequence where two young adults walk around a wedding reception , seeing everything like robocop . they evaluate if women are cows , dogs , or foxes , and a sexual position pops onto the scree . marlee matlin gets drunk at the wedding she 's supposed to photograph and the next day decides to love herself and take a bath because she 's a beautiful and unique snowflake . i liked when the film said people often find evidence for their pre-conceived notions . perhaps in this review i 'm only seeing what i want to see , but i truly wanted to see these people get pies to the face , and it never happened . if you 've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the film before , you may find them interesting , but there are better sources for all of the ideas here . if you want to watch a good movie that talks about the heisenberg uncertainty principle , go see the man who was n't there . if you want to read a good book about quantum field theory , read hyperspace by michio kaku . if you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visuals , see waking life ( although it can feel boring , self-important , and pretentious at times ) . all in all , you should go and read quantum psychology or prometheus rising by robert anton wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie . i normally have a very hard time giving movies a score from 1 to 10 , but this one was a very easy for me : 1/10 stars . the movie 's title is true . the people in this film do n't know # $ * ! hands down , the worst movie i 've ever seen .
after `` central city '' loses its mob boss to murder , partner-in-crime robert armstrong ( as `` doc '' rogers ) decides to take drastic measures to preserve criminal continuity , he recruits the dead mobster 's milquetoast son , richard cromwell ( as edward `` baby face '' morgan ) , to run the family business . the naive mr. cromwell is taken to the city , and installed as president of his father 's `` acme protection agency '' , a front for gangsters . while cromwell sells innocently sells insurance , his `` employees '' run an extortion racket . cromwell falls for pretty client mary carlisle ( as virginia clark ) ; and , the duo find themselves in great danger `` baby face morgan '' catches star cromwell and ms. carlisle nearing the end of their once `` promising '' film careers . it 's a quick , light , and inoffensive little crime drama . * * * * baby face morgan ( 1942 ) arthur dreifuss ~ richard cromwell , mary carlisle , robert armstrong
this is the worst movie i have ever seen , and i have seen quite a few movies . it is passed off as an art film , but it is really a piece of trash . it 's one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing , but that can not make up for sally potter 's disgustingly obvious tribute to herself . the plot of this movie is nonexistent , and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end . especially where she starts singing . it 's absolutely unreal .
this should have been a movie about sam and his wife , the glorious peter falk and equally glorious olympia dukakis . that would have been a movie worth seeing . instead it 's a paul reiser vehicle , with a little falk thrown in . the wonderful elizabeth perkins is also in this movie , but you 'd hardly know it . i presume reiser is under the impression that he 's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle . he 's not . even more galling is that reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background . dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes , but when she does , the screen glows . the story is about falk and dukakis really , but we 're subjected to a pointless , silly , preposterous road trip in which reiser gets to show how very cute , precious and oh-so-deep with psychological insight ( wrong ! ) he can be . for instance , in a restaurant scene that i imagine reiser had hoped was `` cassavetes-like '' there 's a laughably false confrontation between reiser and falk that is so patently ridiculous , i was embarrassed for falk .
natural born killers ( 1994 ) cinema cut : r director 's cut : nc-17 it 's an unusual oliver stone picture , but when i read he was on drugs during the filming , i needed no further explanation . 'natural born killers ' is a risky , mad , all out film-making that we do not get very often ; strange , psychotic , artistic pictures . 'natural born killers ' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media ; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about mickey and mallory , and the teenager says 'murder is wrong .... but if i was a mass murderer i 'd be mickey and mallory ' . mickey describes this with a situation of 'frankenstein ( the monster ) and dr. frankenstein ' - dr. frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers most oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america , the country that the director loves and admires . i guess 'natural born killers ' is about the effect of mass media , technology and how obsessive as a nation , americans are ( and most of the world ) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations . the killers played by woody harrelson ( mickey ) and juliette lewis ( mallory ) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers . mickey and mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing , perhaps in the cruel theory of social darwinism ( survival of the fittest ) - mickey says in his interview in prison , that other species commit murder , we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment ; the script is interesting , but it is questionable how much this film amounts to , in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour , rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen . the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison ; we see the harsh realities of prison life ; the attitudes of the warden etc ; overfilling of prisons - maybe stone is questioning the future , the path that society is leading to . two other interesting characters ; first , a reporter who runs a show about 'america 's maniacs ' and is obsessed with boosting ratings , that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and mallory . the other is police officer scagnetti , an insane , perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers , since his mother was killed during the massacre at waco , texas by charles whitman . the cinematography is superb ; different colours , shadows , styles create a feeling of disorientation ; the green colour most evident of all is green , to resemble the sickness of the killers ( in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote ) . the camera work is insane ; shaky , buzzy , it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it . highly unorthodox , psychedelic and unusual . 'natural born killers ' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers , it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute ... although the above review sound quite positive , i did dislike the film . quentin tarantino , who originally wrote the script for the film , was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed . i can see why . while mildly interesting at times , natural born killers is a mess of a picture . 4/10
i 'll say it again : this movie was totally lame . kids will like it , sure , but adults ... doubtful . the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original , which is to be expected , since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie , but still , did they have to completely rehash the entire movie ? i mean , everything is re-done from the little mermaid . the worst part of it is morgana `` ursula 's crazy sister '' who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody , which is ridiculous since triton is there with his magic trident . why did n't triton do anything about it ? because the plot required him to do nothing . i could go on , but i wo n't . the whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid , and was obviously thrown together without any thought , because they knew it would sell . overall it is a terrible waste of time .
this film is horrible . bad acting , bad writing , bad music . it 's just horrible . not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role-playing games , but the key elements of the film are poorly executed . may the god i do n't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination .
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work ? just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman 's club . that 's what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end . this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen , but every time i was ready to switch the channel , they 'd add another scene with the workout girls and i 'd stay put . as a slasher film , killer workout fails in every category i can think of . as a showcase for beautiful girls working out , it is a success . strong recommendation to avoid , unless the thought of half the film being a big t & a show appeals to you .
i confess -- emma , in my opinion , is the single greatest novel ever written . it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be . jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here . unfortunately , this is at best a palimpsest . comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable -- that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch . there are some good elements here -- kate berkinsale ( having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm , clearly emma 's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful emma . raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill . the production is handsome , but the interiors are far too dark . however , there are several major problems . the first is mark strong -- first of all , he does n't look right for mr. knightley . this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson . it 's badly out of tune . the second problem is one of length . simply put , the film is much too short -- to get the right kind of feel , it would need to be twice as long . finally , and most significantly , there is the quality of the adaptation . austen is an adapter 's dream -- all the dialogue is there already . it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly . andrew davies seems to think otherwise . first , this is a rather gloomy film , and the last thing emma should be is gloomy . more significantly , davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast . what planet , or minor work of thomas hardy , is this come from ? it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel . and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon -- perfection . watch the paltrow version , or watch kate in cold comfort farm .
green street , as it was called in the uk , or hooligans is a bad film . the story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in england , has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately . my first main gripe with hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters . do n't get me wrong , i like elijah wood and have a great respect for his work , but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role . the main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal , however he spends much of the film placid and cheery , only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film . this linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans . at no point during the film was i convinced that a ) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b ) the 'firm ' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold . the other main character is played by charlie hunnam . charlie looks the part , and is fairly convincing as a thug . unfortunately , being a native of newcastle upon tyne in the north of england , he demonstrates the worst east london accent since dick van dyke tried to go cock-en-y in marry poppins . details such as this probably will not bother an american audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the uk , but being from the uk it was a problem i could n't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me . the supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast , especially the role of bover . the lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that charlie played . with a film like this , you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible , unfortunately , the casting failed . imagine if you made a film like the godfather and had sean hayes ( jack ) from will and grace playing michael corleone 's part . you would not be convinced . the story in hooligan is also full in implausibilities . i am no football hooligan , but i am a fantatical football fan . i know how cliquey a group of 'regular ' football supporters can be , as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan , who is not a fan of the club in question , is not from the area in question and not even of english nationality to be embraced by a 'firm ' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases . my final , and biggest , problem with this film , is the way it portrays football hooligans . i take objection to the film 's idea that despite being very violent individuals , hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other . this is complete rubbish . football hooligans are complete scum . they take football , the national sport of england and use it as an excuse to terrorise , frighten and intimidate people . they only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation . they are not brave or loyal , they are cowardly and evil . if the 'gse ' in this film truly loved their club , west ham , why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name . hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to english society . football hooligans do for the reputation of football what hitler did to the reputation of germans . although this film tries/intends to show the 'gritty ' side of football violence . it does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport . it does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins/lighters/glass into the crowd . it does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows . it does not show the real fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to european games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone . if you want to see a good film about football violence , watch the bbc drama 'the firm ' .
della myers ( kim basinger ) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband kenneth ( craig sheffer ) . della gives all the attention to the twins , neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting kenneth . on the christmas eve , she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts , and she does not find any parking space available . when she sees an old car parked on two spots , she leaves a message to the owner calling him `` selfish jerk '' . when the mall closes , della 's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  chuckie ( lukas haas ) , the afro-american huey ( jamie starr ) , the chinese-american vingh ( leonard wu ) and the latin tomás ( luis chávez ) . when the security guard of the mall protects her , he is shot on the head by chuckie , della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals . however she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang . she takes the toolbox and hides in the wood , fighting against the gang to survive . a couple of days ago , i saw the trailer of `` while she was out '' and i was anxious to watch the dvd . unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie , and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés . della myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife ; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family . she is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the batman 's utility belt . therefore , the plot is so absurd that irritates . the gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of american movies , with an afro-american , a chinese-american and a latin together with an american lord to be politically correct . kim basinger has a decent acting , but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman . my vote is four . title ( brazil ) : `` enquanto ela está fora '' ( `` while she was out '' )
i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content . my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing anything . when holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught , it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly . it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked , preventing the servants from getting in . the thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute . i have no clue what this was supposed to represent .
if there was a zero rating , i would give it to this movie . today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still could n't make it through from beginning to end . i ca n't believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise ! the acting is atrocious all around , the script is blah , the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she 's being threatened . the `` southern '' accent from the actress playing amber 's mom is laughable - i 'm from georgia and have friends from texas - believe me nobody talks like that ! none of her emotions seemed real in any scene . the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
i had n't heard of this film until i read an article about it on the unknown movies website , which made me curious . as a cartoonist and illustrator myself , i 'm an admirer of richard williams 's work - i rate ziggy 's gift as one of the finest christmas specials of all time , and even though who framed roger rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when i got past the age of sixteen , i still have the highest of regard for the amount of work , care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals - but it seems the man has his faults , most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule , and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super-talented individual like williams can go , given the right circumstances . raggedy ann and andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children 's cartoon . it tries also to be a musical . it tries to be a thousand and one other things as well - is it a freakout ? is it a mind-blower ? is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination ? - until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations . it 's beautifully animated , for the most part , though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention , but even that does n't count for much when you 're confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the 'action ' here . there are a number of problems with the film , but let 's start with raggedy ann and andy themselves . they 're the stars of the show , yet they have no personalities . actually , we get the message that andy is a wannabe tough guy ( `` i 'm no girl 's toy '' , he sings ) and that ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner , a little girl called marcella , carries her upside down , but that 's all we get to find out about these dull-as-mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after . i use the word `` weirdness '' advisedly , because some weird films can be hugely entertaining , but this is just flat-out strange . the toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable , but they 're actually bizarre and disturbing . the two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this . but even they 're relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain , whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous french doll . yes , this is supposed to be a children 's film ! then there 's the music , none of which is memorable , and all of which is sung by actors who ca n't sing . and to add insult to injury , there 's a lot of singing in this film . when ann and andy finally make it out of the playroom , the first thing they do is sing a long number in the woods about how scared they are , about how they 'll always have each other and ... yes , we get the message . this seems to go on forever , but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film . not for long , though , because the camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it 's made from worn and faded denim , and - bad enough that he 's clearly a paranoid schizophrenic - he also starts hallucinating . but this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow . the greedy , a living , breathing . belching , farting , constantly eating pool of taffy , is so trippy , creepy and ultimately disturbing , you 'll hardly believe what you 're seeing - this is as close to a drug-free psychedelic experience as i 've ever seen on film . then , after a l-o-n-g time spent with the greedy , along comes the psychotic sir leonard looney and his master king kookoo , whose throne resembles a urinal . i ca n't believe i 'm actually writing a capsule description of a real film here - i just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that i 'm not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked-out nightmare i had . part of the sequence in looney land resembles one of the old winsor mccay / little nemo cartoons , for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it , probably . all this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it , but there is n't . these scenes are just strange , and very , very long . surrealism only works when there 's a strong idea behind it , or takes place against some semblance of reality . but nothing in these scenes points towards any kind of reality . take away this element , and you 're left with pure self indulgence . as the final scenes unravel , even the animation begins to look less impressive ( the pirate ship , ludicrously detailed , jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production ) and there 's a non-event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out . even at a meagre 86 minutes in length , the film feels like a never-ending ordeal , and it 's understandable why it flopped on its original release . animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly , but he did , and there 's nothing anyone can do about it .
believe it or do n't , i have my very own dvd copy of this `` movie '' which i bought at walgreens for a great big whole dollar . i 'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted . pretty amazing set designs and costumes . apparently much thought and effort went into their making . the set designs are very mexican in stylization . i liked them a lot . and santa is impressive . one of the more impressive santas in moviedom . i 'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience . but , somehow , it comes across quite deranged . in fact , i 'm left stunned at how deranged it is . maybe it 's the english dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre . one of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of english subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness . the kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very , very weird . did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns ? you did n't ? neither did i until i watched this movie . one learns something new everyday . is this movie actually worth watching ? now , that 's a tossup . i ca n't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it 's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way . yet , its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching . you decide what you 're going to do . i dunno ... for myself , it made me feel uncomfortable seeing demons constantly doing cutesy ballet moves . now , that 's just wrong ...
do not waste your time watching this ! unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you should n't do to make a good film . i am not one to usually review a movie , but this one is personal . i wasted precious time which they can not give back . i feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap . if this was a student project , i would have to say not bad , but only for the first 15 min ... after that it gets annoying . the screaming , the bad audio , the bad video ( a good camera man could have made it much better ) . and yes , whats with the blair-witch effect ? no budget ? i was hoping it was going to get better , but it does n't . now how the hell did it deserves a 4 ? 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time ! i have said my peace .
in the days before gore and sex took over , real horror films were made . castle of blood is , in my estimation , one of the finest , although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings . in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others , which was in the theaters a couple of years ago . director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider ( aka nella stretta morsa del ragno ) . why he did this i do not understand , although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right . perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences . i do not really know . it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color . castle of blood is excellent italian gothic . la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe , who `` appears '' in this film . poe and lord blackwood , owner of a haunted castle , bet american writer alan foster ( george riviere ) that he can not spend all souls night in said castle and survive . foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it , for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts . it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life . lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night ! it does not take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood ( portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele ) long to fall in love , even though their romance is doomed , because elisabeth is one of the ghosts . i will not give the ending away , but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story . comments . this film is greatly atmospheric , even by the excellent standards of the italians . my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody , and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this . in fairness , web of the spider was fine in its own right , even with color and greater brightness . i loved the lingering shots , something most modern day directors do not have the patience for . indeed , when alan first enters the doomed castle , we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room , the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms . by the time the first ghost appears , the audience is thoroughly primed and ready . there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts , something else not often done in standard ghost stories . there are also memorable scenes , very visual for this type of film . elisabeth 's `` murder '' and the dance scene ( reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962 's carnival of souls ) were particularly good . sadly , few general interest viewers will ever hear of , much less see , this film . that is a shame , for this one is a cut above the rest . i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else . for persons interested in this genre , it is a must see .
the school nerd marty ( simon scuddamore ) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion ( set by them also ) where his face is scarred by acid . years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school ( since closed ) for a reunion . what they did n't know is that marty is inviting them back to kill them . then a storm starts , they 're locked in the school and marty starts to take revenge . pretty silly . the murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school -- but that 's about it . the humiliations inflicted on scuddamore are more than cruel ( he 's stripped , has his head dunked in a toilet and gets burnt ) and are just uncomfortable to watch . considering scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view . also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity . there is full frontal of scuddamore ( surprising for any movie ) but one girl decides to take a bath alone ... after they know a killer is wandering around after them ! and then there 's the couple that has to have sex . this is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them . it ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then another twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the tv ! the acting is bearable -- not good , but bearable . caroline munro is in this too . she 's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress . this gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere . otherwise it 's run of the mill and forgettable . scuddamore 's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves .
the fight scenes play like slow-motion jackie chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic ( worst pun by far : `` guess what ? this time i heard you coming '' ) . the stars are a mismatched pair : brandon lee , despite the terrible lines he has to say , actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that dolph lundgren is completely free of ( at least in this movie ) . note to the director : in the future , please stay away from any love scenes , especially when your main actress wo n't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double . ( * 1/2 )
the original is a relaxing watch , with some truly memorable animated sequences . unfortunately , the sequel , while not the worst of the dtv sequels completely lacks the sparkle . the biggest letdown is a lack of a story . like belle 's magical world , the characters are told through a series of vignettes . magical world , while marginally better , still manages to make a mess of the story . in between the vignettes , we see the mice at work , and i personally think the antics of jaq and gus are the redeeming merits of this movie . the first vignette is the best , about cinderella getting used to being to being a princess . this is the best , because the mice were at their funniest here . the worst of the vignettes , when jaq turns into a human , is cute at times , but has a lack of imagination . the last vignette , when anastasia falls in love , was also cute . the problem was , i could n't imagine anastasia being friendly with cinderella , as i considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters . this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom . the incidental music was very pleasant to listen to ; however i hated the songs , they were really uninspired , and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original . the characters were the strongest development here . cinderella while still caring , had lost her sincerity , and a lot of her charm from the original , though she does wear some very pretty clothes . the duke had some truly funny moments but they were n't enough to save the film , likewise with prudence and the king . as i mentioned , the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie , as they alone contributed to the film 's cuteness . i have to say also the animation is colourful and above average , and the voice acting was surprisingly good . all in all , a cute , if unoriginal sequel , that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story . 4/10 for the mice , the voice acting , the animation and some pretty dresses . bethany cox
if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one . a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind . which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action . a few of the actors i 've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better . all the special effects are done by the great `` rondo '' whom performs all the magic whit his mind . a cult movie is written on the box . does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all ? ? ? get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving .
terminus paradis was exceptional , but `` niki ardelean '' comes too late . we already have enough of this and we want something new . big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time , not behind . why people see romania only as a postrevolutionary country ? we are just born not reincarnated , and nobody gives a s * * t anymore about old times . most people dont remember or dont want to remember , and the new generation of movie consumers dont understand a bit . this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi ! maybe younger directors should make the move .
very bad acting , and a very shallow story . not even a decent b-movie events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame . this is one of the worst sci-fi i 've ever seen . i saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre , but it sucked so bad . now there 's really very few good movies on alien subject , i think because most of them are low budget i give it 3/10
... or , more precisely , so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it ! james sbardellati 's `` deathstalker '' of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the sword & sorcery sub-genre has brought along , but it is highly amusing . the acting is terrible , the plot is pure crap , and the effects and photography could n't be more amateurish . but it is the bad acting , the cheesy effects , and the many errors , that makes this movie so hilarious . - spoilers ahead - deathstalker ( rick hill ) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior . one day , a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation , a sword , an amulet and a chalice , in order to free the country from its brutal ruler , the evil king and sorcerer munkar . obtaining the sword is quite easy , but the amulet and the chalice are in munkar 's possession . fortunately , the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county 's most skilled warriors fight each other until death . the winner is then to take the king 's place . of course , the king does n't want anybody to take his place , an therefore he has planned to kill the winner ( instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place ) . deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation , but also to save the old , good king 's gorgeous daughter ( barbi benton ) from the claws of evil munkar . luckily , he does n't get bored on his way to the tournament , since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior kaira ( lana clarkson ) in the meantime ... the film has many great , incredibly stupid and funny scenes . some of my favorite scenes include : - deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword . the head that falls down , however , is not that guy 's head . the falling head has a red goatee , while the guy beheaded by deathstalker had dark hair and no beard . - when the character of female warrior kaira ( lana clarkson ) is introduced , she is first seen in a black robe , hiding her face and body . deathstalker 's traveling companion oghris ( richard brooker ) fights her , and during the sword fight her robe ( under which she is , of course topless ) opens , exposing her breasts . her breasts are the first thing we see of lana clarkson , even before her face . - the last warrior deathstalker has to fight in the tournament , is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig . - evil munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest . he feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers . ... there are many other unintentionally funny , hilarious , and great scenes . the acting is terrible but barbi benton and the late lana clarkson are eye-candy , and although i described this movie as 'unintentionally funny ' , i sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is . there is a fair amount of gore , and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained . `` deathstalker '' is an incredibly awful movie , but i still highly recommend it . people with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives !
the japenese sense of pacing , editing and musical score must be different than american tastes , but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work . someone in hollywood needs to re-make this movie and i think it would be a big hit . the story is interesting and creepy . there 's something about the edges of the city , gritty policemen , earthquakes , sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating . however , this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter . i do have to say that the `` sixth-sense '' effect was in full force in this movie , and that was evident from the very beginning . as it stands , only the die-hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh-so-boring movie .
oh this was a really bad movie . the girl who plays jennifer is ok , but i think she acts bitchy through the movie , not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night , but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap . faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly . i really ca n't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe , i was intrigued a bit by the references to his work ( ravens , house of usher-like family curse , and being buried alive ) -still he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film .
this is the worst show . buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing . even sesame street has better humor and more adult than friends `` friends '' may be the worst thing i 've ever seen on television and i 've been sitting in front of the tube observing friends '' simply does not stack up well to other , contemporary series . it lacks the smartness of `` seinfeld '' and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of `` frasier '' . the characters in `` friends '' seem designed to make them repellant dullards . this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl . the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort . the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so . ( it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of `` friends '' . )
this movie should be called `` plan 9 from joseph smith . '' i think its weirdness is underappreciated . the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich 's `` the population bomb ( 1968 ) , '' and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons . the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of `` heavenly father 's '' ( god 's ) plan . and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad . get it ? this version was filmed in 1989 , which is confusing . it 's utah , so it looks and feels like 1983 , the play was actually written in 1973 , and of course , the theology is part 1840 's , part battlestar galactica . some of the action takes place on earth and some in the `` pre-existence , an aimless romper-room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries , losing their shot at celestial glory . it is as stagey as they come , but do n't let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the 'cool kids ' are all into population control , ( presumably ) counseling their parents not to have any more children ! ! having big families was , at the time the play was written , the cultural norm in the lds community , and more importantly , considered part of god 's plan . the church has since done a 180 , and have made family planning a choice of the parents , and large families are much less the cultural norm now . making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern-day mormon moot ! ahhh but it 's really only as good as the music . there are some catchy tunes here that just wo n't let this movie die the 1970 's death it was pre-destined for . the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there -- wink . and the tough , cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica . so cheers to all that ! gather the family around , make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show !
this has got to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen ! there were people leaving the theatre , others were falling asleep ( ok , it was a late night show ) ... this is a no-sense movie , one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again . i would love to watch the making-off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage . do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they 're doing something interesting ? i wonder ... the soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous bjork album . even if you 're a fan of bjork 's music , stay home . it 's the best thing to do . the little , tiny , pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture . god ! ...
* * spoilers below ! ! ! * * cabin fever has my nod for worst film of the year ... that i 've seen that is . this movie is straight garbage ! there is so much wrong with the film you ca n't help but be amazed at how bad it really is . this movie had so much potential to be good , but ultimately made nothing of it . the characters were as dumb as one can be ; for the entire movie you 're just asking yourself `` why would you do that ? '' or `` what 's your point in doing this ? `` ... this is how illogical and stupid the characters are . we get no background into them , so naturally you really do n't give a rats as $ about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity . - the 'slut ' ( marcy ) for instance ... was she that horny that she had to sleep with paul ( rider strong ) ? there was no point in that .... its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ! ugh . - would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin without looking at it first ? - why did n't bert just shoot the sick guy from the start ? movie would 've been over that way .... besides , they ended up killing him anyway . - why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin , even if they had to walk ? 'no , i 'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected ( one a blink away from death ) to finally opt to walk outta there . - what was exactly the reasoning behind paul 's attempt to fish out the body of the hermit , only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus ? pure stupidity ! i swear , common sense was not a friend , much less an aquaintance to these idiots . i do n't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie . in the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for , and he replied that 'its for the niggers ' . in the end of the film , 3 young blacks ( dressed in baggy clothes , one of them in a du-rag no less ) go into the store .... come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting . then , he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they 're his homeboys . okay , what the hell was the point of that ? ! ? ! ? ! ? how tasteless can one be , what were the filmmakers thinking putting that in the movie ? i as a black man was of course offended by the initial 'nigger ' comment . it was a tasteless , pointless remark . my question to the filmmakers : what was the point of the ending with the black kids ? was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier ? to smooth things over with black viewers , by making a joke out of it ? well , i for one , did not find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit . the whole movie was a joke .... a pathetic attempt at filmmaking that should n't be given the time of day . peter jackson really thought this film was that good ? what film was he looking at ? zero * out of * * * * stars .... if i could give it a lower rating i would . please , fellow imdb'ers , do n't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a 'movie ' . this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced , written and directed vanity project ... while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me ( before the burning at the stake sequence ) : `` this is the worst piece of sh * t i 've ever worked on ... and i 've worked on a lot of pieces of sh * t. '' also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario ( a religious shrine in chimayó ) - at which point one of the local `` vato loco '' low-rider onlookers growled `` ... show some respect man '' , which apparently caused jim to remember where he was , as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior . in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer/director 's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in . like they say : `` ya got ta ' love the biz ... ''
it 's often said that tobe hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film 'the texas chain saw massacre ' and every time i see another hooper film - that view is only reinforced . it would seem that hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as scanners and firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with spontaneous combustion ; a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films . put it all together and you get a messy , boring film that most people would do well to miss ! the film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties . the couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them . fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named sam ; but naturally he 's not a normal person and soon finds when it 's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will . the film stars brad dourif , who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with child 's play two years earlier ; but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible ; and not helped by the terrible supporting performances . the turgid direction and dull script also do n't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects , which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off ; all of which were made some years earlier . the plot is really slow and it 's almost an hour before anything of note happens , and i did n't care for it even then . it soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect . the final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film . not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway . overall , this is a rubbish film and another reason why tobe hooper is a long way from being a great horror director . see firestarter again instead .
please , be warned : this movie , though a pretty bad storyline , was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ... ever . just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie . so , it officially begins with a party . just your average party but there 's some guy there . he 's pretty into kate ... if you know what i 'm saying . memorise his face ; it 'll help later . so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney ( did n't i say the plot was bad ? ) and so takes the tube . that 's london underground at the middle of the night , but she 's just stupid like that . so the timetable says the next , and last , train will come in 7 minutes . now kate , dumb party girl that she is , decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes . typically , she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground . alone . well , almost ... so the movie just carries on from there . blood , guts , limbs , even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body . in short , it 's a typical horror ; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick , weird psycho . or as the case may have it , creep . i 'd say give it a go if you 're into saw , hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us , scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much .
there is n't much to say about this film , it is horrible . the acting and dialog are way far away from even decent , the story of the hybrid werewolf 's is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there . cgi is something you would n't like to see . it so amateurish that it makes me vomit . the only good thing on the dvd was in the extras . the gag reel . everything else , just waste of time and money . i hope noone will buy this , this is not even worth renting . just stay away of this .
that 's right . a movie written , directed and produced by fred tepper and family . ( fred should have known better , having worked the sets of 'titantic ' and 'dogma ' . ) so , the plot . there are some scientists , and some forest rangers , and a hot chick with huge fake breasts . they are all really bad at their jobs , including the hot chick ( who i think is supposed to be a photographer , but who cares because she wears a bikini ) . one of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are `` professional people , '' which is good , because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or ewoks . they are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape-like bones , and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous bigfoot . they just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie . we all hope he dies real soon ( along with his sister who 's meant to be the cute naive one , but is really just annoying ) . then they , * gasp * , find a sasqu ... i mean , ape-like animal burial ground . of course , no mentions that it might just be bigfoot bones they 're messing with ... i guess scientists and forest rangers just do n't think about those types of things . then sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike , chases the other losers away and buries his great aunt muriel and cousin josh ( who died in an unfortunate trout accident ) all over again . insipid , boring dialogue ( i zoned out several times ) , inane plot , unlikable characters , bad cgi ( a man in a monkey suit would look better ) , and acting that just was n't very good all add up to make a movie i wo n't be watching again . you check it out though ; it 's good for some unintentional laughs .
it 's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film . an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor ' or even 'entertainment ' in `` rabbit test . '' so , as a small contribution to this future effort , i 'd like to suggest this word : `` hubiriffic '' ( adj . ) a combination of 'hubristic ' and 'terrific ' ; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film `` rabbit test . '' joan rivers and `` hollywood squares '' producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness . trying to put together an airplane ! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags , ( note to joan : german doctors have n't been funny since vaudeville ) disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that 's is bad enough . but compounding this cinematic crime is river 's directorial style , which can best be described as 'ugly ' , and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags . adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film 's hapless protagonist lionel . watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield ; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face . i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test . cabbages , mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates . but for self-aware , thinking humans - i 'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i 'd recommend `` rabbit test . ''
the biggest national lampoon hit remains `` animal house '' , and rightly so . it was funny , raucous and good-natured . the exact opposite of every other national lampoon film . including `` class reunion '' . please do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst ( `` flounder '' ) from `` animal house '' . or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess . this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful . one star , and that 's being generous . then again , i always thought most of my old classmates were demons , vampires and serial killers , too .
the dubbing/translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick . i have n't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 ( and i 've seen some really bad dubbing in my life , believe me ) . seriously , the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars . it 's just that funny . but ... if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie is n't your cup of tea , then avoid this at all costs .
even when i saw this movie at a teenager , i wondered just how ironic it was that pia zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top . as beautiful and sexy as ms. zadora is , even she could n't keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking . not even her photoshoot for penthouse , in which `` the lonely lady '' was promoted `` back in the day , '' could keep this movie from tanking . the only thing that could have saved this movie ? a completely different script . give this one a miss .
judging by the hype , and other reviews on this site , i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies . what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies . i wonder if there 's another movie called `` cookers '' that these people reviewed ? there are only 3 main characters , and none of them struck me as well-written or well-acted . basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts . do yourself a favor . do n't rent this movie . rent `` cabin fever '' or some other decent horror movie . hell , rent `` mary poppins '' ! the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you 'll find in `` cookers . ''
whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome . otherwise , this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor ( her downward phase ) , and richard burton ( his miscasting phase ) . tennessee williams wrote `` the milk train does n't stop here anymore '' and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play -- but apparently , he was the only one . taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money . whatever , it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner , exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears . it 's so campy that among taylor fans it 's probably considered a `` must see '' kind of thing . but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand , you 're way ahead of me . sadly , this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress , even after winning two oscars . for burton , it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb . judge for yourself if you dare .
i just watched this movie last night , and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film . in a word - do n't . i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantino/eddie murphy phase , i.e . every other word was a curse word . i do n't have a problem with profuse cursing , as in `` good will hunting '' , provided it helps to delve more into the characters . in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional * gasp * or laughter from the audience . the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype , the wall street jerk , the coffee house jerk , and the `` i'm-not-gay-just-in-touch-with-my-feminine-side '' slightly-less-of-a-jerk . you just do n't give a damn about any of them ! they are all shallow , unredemable losers who you want to see lose . for those who dare , this film does have a couple funny moments , the very beginning , and the very end . the toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda `` uh , yeah '' way . really though , i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies .
first off , anyone who thinks this sequel to william friedkin 's `` the french connection '' , is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both . the problem with reviewing this film is that , a . ) it 's a sequel to a brilliant movie , which always makes watching it objectively difficult , and b . ) it 's directed by john frankenhimer , one of the best american directors ever , so i wanted to like it . william friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new york city , because of his documentary-like approach to the action and story , frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever , i.e . `` the manchurian candidate '' and `` seconds '' , and with his `` french connection 2 '' it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off . that fact that frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by gene hackman himself really tells a lot about hackman 's understanding about the original film too . it 's well known hackman hated friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again , it 's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional , loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character . it shows you hackman , despite being a great actor , had no idea who to make the movie and the story great . the plot point of doyle becoming an addict is interesting , but does n't warrant the rest of the film . an unfortunate low point in frankenhimer 's filmography .
i could n't wait to see this movie . about half way through the movie , i could n't wait for it to end . all of the ( white ) actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said , `` say it like this ... '' then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen . it was so annoying . we all know how will ferrell really talks , and he does n't stumble over his words like mr. allen . the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining . i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan , and this movie definitely has not converted me . i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction . this movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies i have ever seen .
let this film serve as the death knell to the `` big twist '' films borne out of the 1990s . known in some circles as the kyser soze syndrome , this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by m. night shayamalan and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind . however , in revolver , director guy ritchie ( known in some circles as `` mr. madonna '' ) , utilizes the soze motif in a far more obsequious manner . jason statham ( with a highly questionable head of hair ) stars as jack green ( known to all as `` mr . green . '' ) he may or may not also be criminal mastermind mr. gold . or , perhaps mr. gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld . i 'm not quite certain , but i certainly do n't care . revolver is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess i 've had the displeasure to endure in quite a long time . witness the fractured time structure , the painful jump cuts , the ceaseless inner-monologues , and the painfully pretentious animated sequence . this `` everything and the kitchen sink '' directing style makes quentin tarantino 's oeuvre look sedate . the cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as i was watching it . the film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to mr. green . i wanted to like green as i always enjoy stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else . here , though , he struggles along like a remedial reader in a university english literature class . his lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis , macha ( ray liotta ) . feasting on scenery like a starving man at a smorgasbord , liotta spits , cries , and fumes through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and leopard print speedos . there are no redeeming qualities to revolver . it 's yet another filmic faux pas from ritchie and might even outdo his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet .
i attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end . i do n't understand how this movie * genuinely * got any good reviews . i think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes . their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job , which makes things more pitiful . movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones ! ! the acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie , and not in a funny way . i do n't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it . i found the lead character to be irritating . his facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish . i thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded , but they were even worse . the script was also very awkward ( his bosses overdone business speech ) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks . i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women . never have i felt that a rating was this misleading . i was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else . of course see it if you want , but i just did n't want anyone else to get their hopes up/waste their time . maybe it is just me ... probably not .
this is a very bland and inert production of one of shakespeare 's most vibrant plays . i can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to shakespeare before . by doing this , though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature . somehow , it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material . the acting is forgettable at best - sam waterston as benedick and douglas watson as don pedro . others , however , do not fare so well . april shawnham 's hero is a pouty , breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces . jerry mayer 's don john is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of snidely whiplash ( though snidley was much more enjoyable ) . f. murray abraham ( you know , the guy who killed mozart ? ) is not in this version , unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits . given that the producer , joseph papp , is basically a theater god , this production is not only disappointing but head-scratching as well . do n't bother with this . watch branagh 's much ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor , to say nothing of wonderful performances .
the movie had a good concept , but the execution just did n't live up to it . what is this concept ? well , story-wise , it 's `` dirty harry '' meets `` m '' . a child killer has begun terrorizing a city . the lead detectives ( dennis hopper and frederic forest ) have never dealt with a serial killer before . the mayor and the police chief , in desperation , secretly hire the local mob to speed things up ... to go places and do things that the police would n't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible . to be fair , this film does genuinely have some good things to offer . besides the concept , i liked the look of the killer 's hideout . norman bates has his basement . this guy has an eerie sewer . in some of the shots , the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls ; often giving these scenes a creepy , dreamlike quality . the acting was good too . dennis hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age . once you get past that , however , it more-or-less goes downhill . the film is paced way too fast . the actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating . this could have been fixed in two ways : either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots . either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery . for an example of how bad this is , one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this : at one point in his life , the suspect went to a pet shop ... that 's right ... i 'm being totally serious here . it 's like they went from point a ( the first clue ) to point z ( the suspect ) and skipped over all the `` in-between '' steps . then there 's the characters . the only ones i actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie . considering that they 're minor characters , i 'd call that a bad sign . finally , there 's the mob angle . this is the one that gets me the most because this is why i coughed up the $ 3 to buy the dvd in the first place . i mean , what a hook ! there 's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years . the mob angle was a gimmick that could have helped it rise above the rest ... , but it did n't . i figured the gangsters 's methods would be brutal , but fun and thrilling at the same time ; kind of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they 'd even throw in some heist movie elements too . we are talking about criminals , after all . instead , we 're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid . the detectives question witnesses . what does the mob do ? they interrogate and kill them . it 's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either . i actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they 're hunting . unless the good points i mentioned are enough to get your interest , i 'd say give this one a miss . maybe some day , they 'll reuse the same story idea and do it right . i hope so . i hate to see such a good concept go to waste .
i would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful . if there are people who watch this piece and think that `` well then jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in ww2 '' , then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal 'why 's and 'how 's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live . what more can a propaganda movie aim for ? the part in which an american movie about the rothschild family is included is re-used very shrewdly here , for instance . the question of why the jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked . no one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata . besides , the level of excitement ( or , the level of disgust ) in the movie increases slowly and the solution-like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda . the audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up ... well done . in the movie , there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience . the movie is kind of history today , so no need to fuss much about it actually . however , in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation , a careful watcher can find relevance to today 's cultural hatred , violence , decivilization as well as the problems of integration . overall , fine trash .
kurosawa really blew it on this one . every genius is allowed a failure . the concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred . there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film . the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal . many of them have interesting stories to tell . a very disappointing film .
the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion , as the relationships , setting , acting and social context all lead to the same place : confusion . even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element , and lacks his usual impeccable clarity , direction and intensity . to make matters worse , his character 's name is 'che ' , and we are only told ( directly , by the narrator ) well into the film that he is not 'that ' che , just a guy named che . the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film , and once defined , the family is divided - the younger generation off to america . so cliché . other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy 's family ; however the political stance of the director is murky at best , and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed . so they lost their property ( acquired by gambling profits ) - so what ? refusing to take a political stand , when making a movie about the cuban revolution , is an odd and cowardly choice . not to mention the movie was in english ! why are all these cubans speaking english ? no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba . and if family life is most important to look at here , it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are 'introduced ' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film ! the acting was mostly shallow , wooden , and unbelievable , timing was off all around . the 'special ' visual effects were confusing and distracting . references to american films - and the black character as greek chorus - strictly gratuitous , intellectually ostentatious , and consistently out of place . i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity , or some point to it all . it never happened .
there is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by cary grant , jayne mansfield , ray walston and werner klemperer . those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by stanley donen , whose comic touch was so evident in , among others , damn yankees ! , bedazzled and charade . for the first five minutes , or so , it seems that those expectations might be met and then . nothing . what is supposed to be a light comedy , plunges into leaden , heavy handed melodrama , with nary a chuckle to be had . relative newcomer suzy parker has often been criticized for her performance , or lack of one , in this film , but in a movie in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden , attacking parker seems unfair . not even as bright a light as an audrey hepburn or doris day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering , dreary and wholly pointless script , which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer 's interest and patience down with it . the rest of the cast , especially ray walston , keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings , but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation . the desperate , inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film 's final moments only serves to add insult to injury . this film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels .
this charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance . marlon brando stands out . there 's a subplot with mira sorvino and donald sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little . i 'm still trying to figure out why charlie want to change his name . every movie with `` charles '' has been pretty bad .
to me this just comes off as a soap opera . i guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered `` social commentary . '' but in the final analysis , i simply do n't care how you characterize this film . none of the characters are very likable or engaging . i felt no chemistry between hudson and bacall . if there is a love story here , it is lost in the malaise . and despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate ( and therefore , incomprehensible ) reversal by dorothy maguire on the witness stand , the story is insufficient to hold my interest . no matter how much freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in , this story is sleazy , melodramatic and trite . rock hudson is nobly wooden . this is lauren bacall 's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances . dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performances , but her character is vile , and his is pathetic . robert keith , as the loving , out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children , is the most sympathetic character . most interesting of all , however , is the severe-looking robert wilke in a small role as the bar owner . he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless westerns , but here he is an honest , likable fellow . i take my social commentary with an interesting , engaging story and a few likable characters , thank you .
this movie was yet another waste of time ... why oh why do i keep renting crap like this ? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * oh well . back to the movie at hand : cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie , ( like i did ) , and just want to check out what 's up in the last ( hopefully ) movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed , then of course this is the movie for you . but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot ... * evil grin * then this movie is definitely for you : -d .... ok i 'm lying ... at best this movie sucks . ok , i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool .. well .. coolish ... and i laughed quite a few times , prolly at the wrong things , but nevertheless i was amused . : - ) but all in all the few things that barely makes the `` ok '' category is n't enough to make this movie worth it at all .. unless you count `` manos - hand of fate '' one of the top ten movies ever !
well this is a typical `` straight to the toilet '' slasher film . long story short , a bunch of teenagers/young adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac demons . this movie has all the basics for this slasher fromage : -naked women , -teens or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky , -gory death scenes , -the last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff , but never bra less , -a creepy , crazy man who knows about the evil , -lesbian kiss scene , -sex being a killer , -no plot even then for a cheesy slasher film , it was really terrible . the atmosphere is totally dead . nothing , not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity , was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested . watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head cold . give the demonic ..... 0/10 .
the film is based on a genuine 1950s novel . journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three `` london novels '' : `` absolute beginners '' , `` city of spades '' and `` mr love and justice '' . i have read all three . the first two are excellent . the last , perhaps an experiment that did not come off . but mcinnes 's work is highly acclaimed ; and rightly so . this musical is the novelist 's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of one 's mind being turned into a glitzy , badly-acted , soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of 1950s london , and does nothing of the sort . thank goodness colin mcinnes was n't alive to witness it .
somewhere , on this site , someone wrote that to get the best version of the works of jane austen , one should simply read them . i agree with that . however , we love adaptations of great literature and the current writers ' strike brings to mind that without good writers , it 's hard for actors to bring their roles to life . the current version of jane austen 's persuasion shows us what happens when you do n't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation . this version does not compare to the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds , which was well acted and kept the essence of the era and the constraints on the characters ( with the exception of the bizarre parade & kissing in the street scene in bath ) . the 2007 version shows a twitty anne who seems angst-ridden . the other characters were not very developed which is a crime , considering how austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen understatements . the sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about , and mrs. smith , anne 's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate is walking around in bath - - twittering away , as many of the characters seemed to do . the strength of character and the intelligence of captain wentworth , which caused anne to love him in the first place , did n't seem to be written into the rupert penry-jones ' wentworth . ciaran hinds had more substance and was able to convey so much more with a look , than p-j was able to do with his poses . all in all , the 2007 version was a disappointment . it seemed to reduce the novel into a hand- wringing , costumed melodrama of debatable worth . if they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into austen 's work , they should have done what they do with adaptations of shakespeare : adapt it to the present . at least `` bride & prejudice '' was taken out of the historical & locational settings and was fun to watch , as was `` clueless '' . this was n't persuasion , but they did n't know what else to call it .
oh man , what was sam mraovich thinking ? what was anyone who was involved in this `` film '' thinking ? mraovich is the head of nearly everything of `` ben and arthur '' : director , writer , producer ( also executive producer ! ) , caster , lead star- you name it , he did it . and he ( mraovich ) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making . so what is wrong with this film ? everything . the film is about two gay lovers , ben ( jamie brett gabel ) and arthur ( mraovich- * groan * ) . ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people . to make things worse , ben 's crazy `` ex-wife '' ( they do n't exactly divorce ) , tammy ( julie belknap ) is steaming mad that ben 's left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together ( saying that she can be gay , too ! ) and arthur 's christian devoted , excessively hypocritical , equally batty as tammy brother , victor , is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church . the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs ( ie . ben and arthur fly to vermont to get married- they go there on alaska airlines and vermont has palm trees ; they fly back on a fedex cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate , plus many , many more ) and plot holes to boot ( victor calls killing arthur `` the final plan '' which later changes to `` the final deed '' ; arthur and the private ( intern ) detective drive the same car , blah , blah , blah ) . the `` actors '' are all very bad and are way , way over the top ; the script is laughably horrible ( one such example is `` i do n't make sense ? you do n't make sense ! i make sense , that 's who makes sense ! '' ) and there so much more wrong with the `` movie '' that i ca n't write them all down . however , the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about `` ben and arthur '' is that sam mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic ( see his fake reviews for `` ben & arthur '' and obvious comments by him on youtube. ) . mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is . so , to conclude , forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- `` ben and arthur '' will knock them right off that title , even paris hilton movies look like `` the dark knight '' compared to the monstrosity known as `` ben and arthur '' .
does anyone think that this show actually helps some people , or does it only anger the people who watch it ? when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity . i understand that pat roberson is not all together . what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say . pat roberson is of little consequence . he is an old man who thinks in an old way . fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did ( thank god ) . now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity .
the plot of 'house of games ' is the strongest thing about it : a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters , but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do , she finally gets her revenge . that 's about the pitch : but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets . it has to be the director mamet : lindsay crouse has had a varied and pretty steady tv and film career , so she ca n't perform this badly all the time . she 's supposed to go from uptight , cool , controlled professional to calculating , wicked fast lady having fun , as shown by the change from beige trouser suit ( which she seems to wear for three days straight , including underwear ) to floppy floral sundress . but everyone seems to be speaking their lines the same clipped , precise way ; i imagine mamet wanting to make sure not a syllable of his scintillating script got missed . the effect is unsettling and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and suspense he is presumably trying to create . at times 'house of games ' loses any connection to how human beings actually behave or talk , and becomes just a mechanism to spin out the plot . the clunky vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack does n't help either . the ultimate result is that the only entertainment to be had is in guessing the outcome , and the sooner you do that the sooner you will get bored with the robotic , two-dimensional performances . and they smoke too much ! ! !
ok i will admit , it started out very pleasing and good , but then it just dropped downhill , i can not believe sarah michelle gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie , the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie , was i wanted to see the twist at the ned , and to my surprise , well , folks i can not even tell you if there ven was one , because the end just leaves you confused , and then the credit role , i was like what the hell ? this did not deserve a theater run , i am sorry , but it did n't i mean it was horrible , the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts ... thats it ! you can watch it , im not telling you not to , hey you might even like it or even love it ! but if you hate it , do n't say i did n't warn you !
the psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out . its often billed as an anti-rpg movie , but its really not that simple . here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what ( if anything ) they 're trying to say about gaming . they laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction , all of them having parents who are divorced , alcoholic , and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they 're harshly pressuring them to succeed . tom hanks is arguably the worst off , having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead . its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives . and sure enough , at the end , when they go to see robbie ( hanks ) , they 're all happy and well-adjusted , embarking on their adult careers , problems solved , games put away ( daniel does n't even want to design computer games any more ) , and even robbie 's mother , who 's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied , is suddenly the happy homemaker , looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers . sure , jj suddenly ( and quite cheerfully it seems ) decides to commit suicide , but the reason seems to be entirely because he 's a lonely boy genius who ca n't get a date , and not because his character dies , as in the famous jack chick tract ( which happens afterward anyways , and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end daniels game and get everyone to come play his . in fact , the prospect of live-action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself ! ) and in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie , kate , looking very fetching in chain mail , looks right at the camera and says something like , `` the scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds . '' the biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty , homeless-looking guy of his magic beans . the recurring theme ( a `` the way we were '' for the 80s ) might have been poignant at the end , but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place . and for one final mystery , our hero , wearing full pardu regalia , has a psychotic break , becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest , so of course the first thing he does is change into 20-century street clothes . so maybe the movie 's irrational , but i guess its dealing with an irrational topic . in those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed , and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo-jumbo at you . the anti-game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene , where the reporter asks the cop whats going on , the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there 's a chance mazes and monsters is somehow involved . the reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game ( although he allows his own children to play it ) , then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation . in the end , its no masterpiece , but interesting as made-for-tv movies go .
if derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing , then you 're in for a rare treat ... they do n't really appeal to me , so i could n't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale . it seems like something straight out of the 1980s , a different age when this would have gone straight to video . gillian anderson and danny dyer do ok work with a weak script and a tedious scenario . but what is gillian anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as lady deadlock in the bbc tv adaptation of bleak house last year ? the director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries , but even that 's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up dyer . i do n't think i was the only person in the cinema laughing . what i ca n't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - filmfour and verve pictures . both have been involved in some great independent british films in recent years . verve distributed bullet boy , code 46 and red road - straightheads does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath . filmfour and verve take note : is this really the best you can do ? what are independent british filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement ? it 's a big blot on both of your reputations . listen carefully : can you hear the thousands of fans of independent british films crying in despair ?
there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it 's not very good . limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal . the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney 's kim possible , ( brendan , the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible ) background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark , yet by today 's standards , overall it is still poor and cheap looking . many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80 's , nice in its own way but for modern child audiences , used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind , is sure to disappoint . the story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors are n't overly impressive , noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part . there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist . however , some of the characters are good , the viking villains , although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound . there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together . the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off/homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay . the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic/celtic/anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look . the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner , including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive . best of all though is the music , much of the background music is melodic and moving , specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers . if the whole film was as poetic as this moment , ( and it tries , ) then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience , but instead it is n't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and does n't stand up to modern animation standards . overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways , but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment . oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time , not sure how that was possible .
this movie was horrible . i swear they did n't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie . ice-t was annoying as hell . * spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it * they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes . he coulda been long gone . the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs . and when ice-t is on that hill and uses that spaz-15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle ( and then cuts down a tree with eight shells ? ? it would take 1000 's of shells to cut down a tree that size . ) shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards . and they even saw the reflection . what reflected the light ? ? i did n't see a scope on that thing . also when he got shot in the gut and kept going , that was retarded he would of bled to death right there . plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel . it would n't blow up and kill him . the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel .
watching it lives by night makes you wonder , just who in the world greenlit this crap . a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon , get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people . and where exactly are they ? they 're in the desert , then they 're skiing , then they 're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby . the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy . the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle . there 's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger . special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie . i guess you have to start somewhere .
there 's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead . it 's only my opinion , but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable , intelligent characters . as far as likability is concerned , the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple . nicely done . unfortunately , they are stupid beyond belief . let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker . 1 . after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you , be sure to tell him what hotel you 're staying at when you drop him off . 2 . beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses , thereby allowing him to press charges of assault . 3 . do n't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume ( for no apparently good reason ) that the cops were bribed by him . 4 . while trying to escape , let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her . 5 . after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife , be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one-on-one . no point in being unfair , right ? now , i 'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions , but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it 's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety , since they are victims of their own doing . this kills the enjoyability of the entire film . in case you were wondering , the scriptwriters did n't stop with dim-witted characters . since they themselves are surely dim-witted for writing this crapfest , they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window . 1 . the stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away . 2 . the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people , yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior . 3 . the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being . 4 . the `` suspense '' scenes had no imagination whatsoever . in fact , some scenes were direct rip-offs from american movies . the only positive is the decapitation near the end , which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife . it 's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field . truly , the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves . better yet , they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence .
and forget this . completely . if you really need to see madonna act , rent `` body of evidence '' , at least willem defoe is in that one . in this film , while the sets are beautiful , you may want to mute the dialog . you wo n't miss anything . bruce greenwood is wasted , jeanne tripplehorn is a prop , and madonna is so awful , it becomes amusing . why they had to butcher the original film into this mess , i will never know ; guess they thought it was `` bankable '' . madonna , as an actress , certainly is not . if you rent the original film from 1979 , though , you will enjoy it , and the actors in it can actually act . 1/10 .
the same difficulty i have with the musical version of `` les miserables '' applies equally to `` oliver . '' instead of the composers ' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings , they merely wrote broadway-type melodies , which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed . too , the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score . it 's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste . the casting of the boy oliver does n't help matters : tentative of timbre and vexingly precious , there 's something less than solid here . fagin performs his traditional routine adequately , though the tunes he 's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner . `` as long as he needs me '' is given a strident rendition , throaty and strained . the two big production numbers , `` who will buy '' and `` consider yourself '' seem over-produced , with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in . it 's one thing to go all out , yet another to cross over the line into excess . the gloom , despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography . while the novel is considered a classic , i must confess i have trouble with mr. dickens ' consciousness , in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration . this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life , which was full of disappointment and regret . not all the combined talent of this production , either on- or behind camera , can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material . all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me .
i never saw the original 1954 version with judy garland , so have no means of comparison . also , it 's been some years , but i found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating . the movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions . john norman howard is a worn out , disillusioned rock star on the decline , embarking upon a romance with a fresh , talented new singing sensation , esther hoffman . her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline . the lead actors , kris kristofferson and barbra streisand , are adequate in their roles , but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me . the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect , streisand 's beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song 'evergreen ' . she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice .
standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process . rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense . banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient `` military-styled '' gang of robbers . two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first . as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again . mikael persbrandt must be in every swedish film from the last few years ! but that 's ok i guess since persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here ( like he usually does ) . the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself . first of all the robberies feel mostly like background . rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world ( like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin ) . also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing . but still , i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then . it spiced things up a bit ( and actually saved the rating from dropping another step ) . in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind . simply that the action and suspense does n't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind ( mostly hollywood ) . it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison . in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting , and forget about trying to make `` hollywood-action light '' like they do now . because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie-industry . i rate it 3/10 .
i ca n't say much about this film . i think it speaks for itself ( as do the current ratings on here ) . i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it . i even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice , but i just could n't . i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever , ever again . and i 'm not one to trash a movie , but i truly believe this was awful . it was n't even funny in the slightest . the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them . i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me . all i can think of when i see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie , and it reminds me not to waste my money . amy poehler is so very annoying , too . overall , well , i think you get my point . the stars are for walken , by the way .
i watched this movie purely for the setting . it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of . the plot was predictable , the acting was mediorcre at best , the scares were all gross-outs , not true scares . i do n't remember much of the plot , and i think that 's because there was n't much of one to remember . they did n't even use the hotel to it 's fullest potential ... the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula . at low tide , you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay , which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks . the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action ( and i 'm using that term loosly ) scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings !
`` dutch schultz '' , aka arthur fleggenheimer , was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented . this movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character , because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology . not only that , it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate n.y. and his religious conversion . it is true that he was executed by luciano , lansky , et . al . but that 's as far as it goes . the exploding plate scene which represents luciano carrying out the execution of bo weinberg in his own home , assisted by his own mother is rediculous . also , there is the scene in which dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to legs diamond . it just does n't work . the character of mrs. fleggenheimer does n't work either . this movie does not need a doting jewish mother for comic relief . the lame representation of legs diamond was humorous enough . i 'm sure the man is turning in his grave . and , by the way , dutch did in fact personally kill people , but , he was not rambo or 007 . the scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd . i do n't know . maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and i just did n't get it .
have you ever heard the saying that people `` telegraph their intentions ? '' well in this movie , the characters ' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better , or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced . embeth davidtz 's character is not mysterious , just wooden , and kenneth branagh does n't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have . the bottom line : obvious plot , one-note performances , unlikeable characters , and grotesque `` southern '' accents employed by british actors .
geez , as a gay man who lives in nyc i can gratefully say that i have never seen the underbelly of gay culture that is portrayed in this film - and i am glad of it ! ! ! was this film broadcast on tv across the united states there would be a great anti-gay backlash and i can not say that i would blame them . the people in this film do not represent the average gay american or even the average trandgender american , what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare . the inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments ( anti-white ) are blatant and unsettling - society can not be blamed for people who have chosen drugs , unemployment and rejection of education on the part of the film 's `` cast '' - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation , but rather a rejection of anything resembling personal ambition and a willingness to make something out of one 's self .
with an absolutely amazing cast and crew , this might have been a classic . instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the jfk assassination grafted , rather pointlessly , on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in 1960 . many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - sterling hayden or eli wallach , for instance , or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - john huston . jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well , in their very different ways , though . the photography is gorgeous , but does not justify an hour and a half of your life , or the price of the dvd purchase .
`` nacho libre '' ( 2006 ) directed by : jared hess starring : jack black , ana de la reguera , héctor jiménez , & darius rose mpaa rating : `` pg-13 '' ( for some rough action , and crude humor including dialog ) say what you will about it ( i know some people who despise it to no end ) , but i have always thought that `` napoleon dynamite '' was a funny movie -- not the brightest brick on the wall , but a funny movie , nonetheless . jack black is also a very funny man -- irritating at times , yes , and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him , but funny . there has rarely been a jack black comedy that i did not enjoy to some degree . so , i was very happy to hear that jared hess , the writer and director of `` napoleon dynamite '' , and jack black would be teaming up for a movie about a spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . my only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . unfortunately , my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . this plot , had it been done as a skit on some such show as `` saturday night live '' or possibly even `` mad tv '' , would have worked flawlessly . unfortunately , the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat . nacho was raised in a mexican monastery and became a devout man of the lord . feeling shunned by the entire monastery , nacho ( black ) , now the monastery 's cook , decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . as the monastery 's finances hit an all-time low , nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery 's orphanage . this plot sounds so sweet and caring . it seems like the perfect movie for jack black . look what he did with `` school of rock '' after all . well , to my displeasure , this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . it is again hollywood 's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor of course , for all i know , maybe that is the general thought of teenagers , as many seemed to enjoy this movie . watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh , but do n't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . a seven-year-old could make up the same joke . the performances in `` nacho libre '' are actually good . jack black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic , worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . unfortunately , this movie just was n't enough for him . it did n't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . i had never seen or heard of ana de la reguera before , but now i can say that , not only is she quite talented , but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . she just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . héctor jiménez , who plays nacho 's bumbling partner , esqueleto , kept me laughing continuously . he did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of jack black 's . darius rose , who plays an orphan named chancho , did n't have many lines , but , what can i say , i just enjoyed him . he was adorable . the rest of the cast did their job . it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie . `` nacho libre '' just does not work . its plot is stretched far too thin . the heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just do n't work . i very rarely laughed and , if i did , it was because of jack black or another member of the cast . and that leads me to the bright side of `` nacho libre '' : yes , the cast . this cast was just well , for lack of a better word , they were on . they all clicked , had excellent chemistry together , and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . after jared hess 's `` napoleon dynamite '' kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie , i was surprised to find myself so often bored with `` nacho libre '' . something was lost here and i have yet to understand what it was . all i know is that `` nacho libre '' is not a good movie and yet , because of its cast , it is completely worthless . there is a small reason to watch , if only to watch jack black work . but , if you are not a fan of jack black , then avoid this movie like the plague . i like black , but i am done with this movie and with this review . final thought : yikes ! this is jared hess 's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical `` napoleon dynamite '' . overall rating : 4/10 ( c+ )
i 'm no horror movie buff , but my wife 's nieces and nephews are . so , i saw the first movie . it was gruesome , and tense , but not my taste . still good though . for similar reasons , at this very moment , i am being exposed to a sequel . the premise itself is beyond absurd . i can buy that disasters occur in the desert . i can buy that mutants exists . i can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved . it is unlikely , yes , but i 'm willing to suspend my belief . however , under no circumstances am i willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants . being a member of the united states army , i can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers , any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad . a squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives . that 's just the way it works . squad movements , vastly superior firepower , and of course , radio support , would ensure nothing less than total victory . i 'm not saying you would n't have casualties , but as soon as the area was verified as hostile , military training would take precedence , no-one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom . and if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger , they would radio in for backup . and believe me , their radios would not be jammed , if there was a chance that normal radios would not do , the squad would have a military issue satellite phone . chances are , if they were unable to check in every hour , a search would be called . in order to accept this movie , you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools , with incompetent leaders , and an incompetent chain of command . while it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass , our military forces are filled with intelligent , well-trained , competent soldiers . mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with . with the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine , the film fails to deliver . instead , we are expected to believe that our soldiers , sailors , and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats . as a combat veteran , i find the movie insulting .
dear richard , i know we all loved you on home improvement with tim allen . but seriously , do you not have anything else to do besides lame sequels to air bud ? i would have thought tim might have actually give you a bit role by now or even becoming his personal assistant . i know that seems ironic , but the pay benefits are much more rewarding . everybody would see you around tim and instantly think `` tool time '' . you would even get roles with bob vila more often . instead , you appear for 10 minutes with a golden retriever and smiling . i know there was n't much of a script , but you could have added to it . i mean , come on . tim owes you one . but seriously , this movie does nothing for the air bud line . quite the contrary , the fake talking puppies are cornier than actually seeing the dogs play sports . the original was better . and you , mr. richard karn , know that more than anybody . this is an `` f '' movie .
a schizophrenic has escaped from a nyc mental hospital and soon teachers start getting offed at st. trinity university . new teacher julie ( francine forbes ) has to deal with the mess of red herrings . despite a 78 minute running time , this cheap-o slasher drags on and on until the lame finish where the person you suspect is the killer from the get go is revealed to be as such . director richard haines barely breaks a sweat with some lame stalk-n-slash staging but delivers the grue the early 80s audience was probably craving . for all of our amateur anthropologists out there , this was filmed in new yawk in early 80s so you can check out all of the culture , beliefs , and practices of living people from that far away place . the film does get some credit for offing the `` final girl . '' you rarely see that . also , always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer . doth thou not trust the clergy , my beloved film industry ? thankfully , this one is only a phony priest and he gets caught . he is still working the moral high ground angle though .
this film was done in really poor taste . the script was really bad . i feel really sad for the late gregory peck who took on the title role of this b-movie adaptation of one of history 's greatest generals . the movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the japanese in world war 2 . there was a scene where i almost vomited , it showed macarthur in a bunker in corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded , one legged filipino soldier . the soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : ` no papa , no mama , no uncle sam ' and macarthur gives his little pep talk that americans ` would never abandon ' the philippines . the scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by macarthur 's words and gives him a smart salute . i mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the u.s. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake . it showed that filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great americans solely for redemption . it blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the usaffe ( united states armed forces of the far east ) , these are filipino volunteers that were integrated in the us military during world war 2 , who died side by side with the americans fighting the japanese , who walked side by side with americans in the death march of bataan and defended corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after macarthur left for australia with his famous ` i shall return ' speech . my late grandfather , a filipino world war 2 veteran and usaffe soldier was one of the many who fought the japanese with honor and love for the home country . i think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the leyte gulf landing .
when will the hurting stop ? i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again . they keep on making movies with the same story , falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest , but sadly fail to do so , as this is not a good story . moralistic , old-fashioned , conservative happy-thinking . as if people learn . the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don´t .
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing . you know the type .... funny but supposed to frighten you .... this was not funny or horrific . the writing was lame ... the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness .... they were so expected . the actors did n't even do much with such a not so good script ... at least i hope that was n't their best .. watch this movie at your own risk ...... i give it negative 3 stars outta 10
at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie , i though that will be great but it was n't . is a bad copy of the richard donner work , lex is again a villain that makes no more else , even played by kevin spice . the evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot forced . the script is predictable and simple ( all stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old lady ) . the story is the wrong thing , it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be better . i just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy . all read you later
probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever , badly acted and badly written . the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm , but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one , the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll , or could it be one of the five characters . acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine , and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end . the kills ca n't really see why they banned this , the kills look fake mostly , one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake , but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car , one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive . overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
the original movie , man from snowy river , is one of the best i 've seen , nearly perfect . a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses -- rich girl/poor boy , and ability vs. bloodline . the sequel , however , is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous , overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as `` rambo meets the black stallion . '' without the charm of the black stallion . the young hero comes back from a 3-year absence , and suddenly he 's superman on horseback ; in the original , good film , he was real and believable , but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel . i 've hardly been as disappointed in a movie , and at times this thing made me quite angry -- they missed hardly a cliché . brazen audience manipulation -- do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them , to make them happy ? a mess of a movie .
my title just about sums this heap of crap up i should have taken a hint when i saw it was a fred olen ray movie - but i thought 'hey , it might be better than his usual rubbish ' boy , was i wrong ! this has to be the worst movie ever targeted at children . the acting was awful , the humour was non-existent , the direction was the worst i have ever seen & the special effects would n't seem out of place on a 1950 's disney movie . what has happened to dee-wallace stone ! who once had such a promising career in the 80 's . movie veteran & former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad-guy & the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie . i have n't seen the sequel made in 1999 and nor do i intend to if you want a good kid movie watch 'honey i shrunk/blew up the kids/kid ' or any disney movie my rating as a 19 yo : - 2/10 rating as a kid movie : - 3/10 at the best !
i saw this for free , thankfully , and wish it was better than it was , but it 's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years . ben stiller and jennifer anniston play a couple who are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other . if that plot line does n't take you by surprise and thrill you , the movie wo n't either . lots of sight gags and fart jokes . halfway through the movie i began to realize that ben stiller really is n't that funny , but he tries very hard . and jennifer anniston really is n't that pretty , but her hair looks great . and hank azaria and phillip seymore hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho-hum movie , i 've come to expect more from them . what was interesting was that i saw this after i saw american splendor , which is a truly funny and original movie- and i compared the two in my head , and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back- perhaps that would knock some sense into them and they 'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes .
i am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say , `` the book was better . '' i know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it was n't a faithful adaptation . there is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's/editor's/cinematographer's/producer 's control and certainly out of the original author 's control . therefore , it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same , word for word , as a book or play or video game or disneyland ride , or whatever ! a movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society . moreover , a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and , if it is based on source material , its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers . films like there will be blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century , oil ! , it feels relevant because of things like the iraq war and energy concerns that the film 's country of origin , the us , was and is experiencing . even king kong , based on the original film , benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have . with that said , i just do n't understand why they even bothered to make this movie ? besides the great performances , guaranteed oscar nods and shanley 's director/writers fee and royalties he will get , this movie seems to come from nowhere . it should have simply stayed as a play . the movie ( which is essentially the same as the play ) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the catholic church here and abroad . it says nothing new or different than the original play . i ca n't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time : frost/nixon , which was also based on a play . frost/nixon , while about nixon 's regrets , seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when president bush was about to leave office . the regrets that nixon had , as depicted in the play/movie , about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on bush and his presidency . in that respect frost/nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time . in contrast , doubt felt like it was yesterday 's news and did n't seem to offer anything that the play did n't offer . of course the movie is `` good , '' the performances are outstanding , and the screenplay adaptation is apt , but so what ? why did n't it just stay as a play ? why , besides marketing and financial reasons , make it into a movie ? it gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject .
i did n't expect much from this film , but oh brother , what a stinker . i found this gem in a giant crate of awful $ 5 dvd 's at walmart ( where else ) ? as cheap as this disc was , i feel ripped off . the special effects had a high school look to them , the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'christian school ' . one can imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings ' by the production company after seeing the rushes come back - the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out . think of their anguish as they saw their $ 914.86 investment go up in smoke . someone asked why christian movies are so bad - perhaps the xian film-makers need to look at good movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good . believable stories and characters , less hysterical arm-waving and fanaticism , oh , and a story that appeals to -everyone- , not just true believers . i.e . stop the sermon , save it for church . take the omen or prophesy series , for example . excellent films with compelling story lines , great cinematography and intense music . no hysterical arm-waving . no preaching . if this film had a laugh track it would have been much better .
as low budget indies go , you will usually find that you get what you pay for , and let me just say , i did n't pay much for `` frightworld '' ... writer / director : david r. williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park , besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer . not a bad premise , but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes . the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it 's audience , by constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us . this becomes evident right off the bat , as we are introduced to the would-be killer , and soon realize that the ( acting ) is the scariest thing happening ... after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times , yet the acting remains the same . `` frightworld '' does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun-house , but with an extremely long running time , it ca n't save the film from it 's below average indie hell . there is some mediocre nudity , but not much for gore , which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies . fans of really bad b-movies might find something of interest here , otherwise , do n't spend a lot of cash .
this film is really unbelievable . i 've seen so much cheap trash-movies , especially a lot 'full moon'-pictures , but 'dollman ' is really hard . so much comes together : the laughable story , the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects ! how long i could talk about them ! it is a really bad movie , but also one of the funniest ones . if you 're a fan of bad movies to laugh about , you have to see it . and do n't miss 'dollman vs . demonic toys ' . it really funnier and worse .
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen . i can not express how bad it is . i honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end . i recommend instead of seeing this movie , you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars . i had such high expectations when i read the back of the dvd case , and when in the beginning it added that jesus was following them i was so excited ... then by the end i wanted to kill myself . i mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... just pain ! monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash . at least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage . it would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror . it was n't that i did n't get the jokes , it 's that they were not only not funny , they repeated themselves like twenty times . apparently , something is n't funny unless you see it like a million times . do not under any circumstances see this . people have rated 'manos the hands of fate ' as the worlds worst movie . i have seen that too and agree that it is bad ... but alas it is only the second worst . 'fatty drives the bus ' is by far worse . this deserves all kind of harsh language , but i ca n't write that here so just imagine i swore a whole bunch .
as a big fan of david mamet 's films and plays , especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna , i was expecting great things from this film . instead , i found myself annoyed by the film 's superficiality and lack of credibility . racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them , in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized . identity is totally reevaluated and men become `` heroes '' for no apparent reason . because of his oaths taken as a cop , the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives , and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal , but then still refuses the minor action . in addition , a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting , and the cop 's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits . needless to say , after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet , i was extremely disappointed to say the least . 3 out of 10 .
in a way , corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands . but it fails at making them laugh ... les visiteurs has had its success , because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about zemeckis 's back to the future , here comes the old france , the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life . full of pride , funny thanks to the ancient words he uses , montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor . then comes the sequel . nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of les visiteurs , the first . and it 's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money . the general story begins after the end of les visiteurs , and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought . explanation : it 's no use trying to get back the jewelry jacquouille has stolen ; do n't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? where do you think he found the money ? selling the jewelry ... and that 's only one of many holes poiré tries to avoid ... and fails . let 's have a look at the characters : montmirail does n't change , he 's just a little more boring . regarding frenegonde ... that 's another story : valérie lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role . and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her . and poiré does n't realize that a cast of humorists is n't enough to make a good comedy . forget about the time travels , about the digital effects , concentrate on the story and you 'll see that there 's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times . the main interest of this film is the landscapes . a movie for youngsters , let 's say up to 13 years old .
this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it . if you take the first movie , and reverse the plot ( ariel wants to leave the sea , her daughter wants to go to the sea ) , take the same characters and give them new animals and new names , and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor , possible , you get the little mermaid 2 . its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot . i 'll take you through the horror of it step by step . these are the people from the 1st movie : first of all , prince eric is still prince eric , with about 3 lines in the whole movie . ariel is uptight , annoying , and is not the carefree , headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st . in fact , she is the exact opposite . sebastian is still sebastian only less cute , less convincing as being stressed out , and the jokes just are n't funny anymore . flounder has about 2 lines . he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice . scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny . king triton 's character is probably the best , he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter , melody . ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter . like i said , all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them . this is what they did : ursula- the new evil villain is morgana , ursula 's sister who feels like she always lived in ursula 's shadow . i would n't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife . she ca n't do anything right and she 's a failure as a villain . she has the same voice ursula did . sebastian & flounder - have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks , tip & dash , a walrus and a penguin . they try to be hero 's but always fail when trying . the plot is so predictable . they become heroes at the end . yawn . flatson & jetsom- now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton . hes really bad too . morgana and the shark ( sharkbait , i think was his name ) have no chemistry , good or bad . ariel-ah , ariel . our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un-lovely daughter , melody . melody can not sing , her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be , and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet . she wants to go to the sea , she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her , she has to go find herself . yawn . not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is . certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original . basically , comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca . do n't ever watch this , not even when your bored .
believe me , i like horror movies . i like science fiction movies . i like independent films . and , i like low-budget , b movies . sometimes , i even like bad acting , plodding scripts , wooden lines , improbably situations , and the like . however , i did not like christmas on mars . it just does n't work on so many levels . for all the reasons listed previously , and many more . that includes the nonsensical , blatant use of images of female genitalia . and the many allusions to male genitalia , in a very freudian way . i am convinced this is purely from ineptitude . as opposed to some attempt at doing something really different . i mean any movie that takes years to film , just can not keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences . i had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character . however , sadly , it was meant to have happened , as we saw things unfold on screen . about the only kindness that i can express , is that the image at the end was stupendous . if this had been used at the beginning , instead of the end , it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended ... to bad they did n't try that instead . i just do n't understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made . was it the plot ? surely , it could n't be . was it the characters ? i doubt it ; i mean , i could live without knowing about ed 15 . was it the dialog ? emphatically , no . the music ? perhaps , but more-likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked . much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor .
profanity , stupidity , self-indulgence , and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie-making . pesci 's attempt to prove my cousin vinny was no fluke , shows the opposite instead . he is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead . a true must-miss !
read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life ( was that all ! ) . unremittingly bleak , this film sets out to produce ( i 'm guessing ) a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style . if fails .... completely and absolutely fails . i 've been trying to think of one good thing about it and ca n't . let me mention some of the highlights ... people do n't die , they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa 's factory . angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees . santa can bring people back from the dead ( if you send him a nice letter ) . and the plot .. i wo n't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there is n't any . even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze , everywhere looking cold , damp and miserable . as you might guess , the film has a happy ( schmaltzy ) ending . what a relief !
i do have the ` guts ' to inform you to please stay away from ` dahmer ' , the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer . ` dahmer ' strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject . jeffrey dahmer , who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts , was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation . however , the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful ` dahm ' project . this is not an easy film to digest , even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery ` brainsadillas ' appetizers or even some real-life ` mr . potato skins ' . * failure
suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s tv hit `` love , american style , '' decked out with flashes of nudity , `` superchick '' ( 1973 ) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain . and the lead character here , tara b . true , really is some kind of superchick . a stewardess ( not flight attendant ) who 's so good-looking that even her plane 's autopilot has made a pass at her ( ! ) , and with a hunky boyfriend in every port , this wingin ' , swingin ' gal really does put the `` lay '' in `` layover . '' what with her germaphobe surgeon beau in new york , her playboy with gangster problems in miami , and her creatively challenged rock star dude in l.a. , tara sure does keep busy . and when she 's not draining these guys of all their manly energies , as the viewer learns , she 's liable to be taking a karate class , mile-high clubbing , fending off flashers and rapists , attending groovy pot parties and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane . as i said , lighthearted fun , and surely good for a night when you 're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube . future astrologist joyce jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as tara , and the film looks handsome enough to please . disappointingly , buxom '70s faves uschi digard and mary gavin ( aka candy samples ) are wasted here in very small roles , but still get to do what they do best -- show off their chesticles ! though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and does n't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head , it does succeed in being consistently amusing , and i suppose that is something . strange that the end credits should call attention to ms. jillson 's body double , however ; do n't think i 've ever seen that before !
a shaky hand-held camera was used , presumably to give the film a documentary look , but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion-sickness just from watching it . it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera ( no offense meant to cp sufferers , but i do n't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer ! ) the camera work was so nauseating , and so distracting , that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture . i checked back a while later ( it was showing on tv ) , and it had n't gotten any better . i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten !
this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie . the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles , it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous . if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed , but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts ( which i might add are poorly done ) and wish you were some warrior to . the casting in this movie was n't very good , and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it did n't fit at all . on a scale of 1-10 ( 10 being excellent , 1 being horrible ) the acting in this movie is a 4 . brenda song is talented in comedy , but with this kind of movie , in some of the more serious scenes , her acting was laughable . when she made some of her `` fighting '' poses , i started laughing out loud . i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing , for example , the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing , how her voice turns dark and evil , i think that was incredibly stupid , and how wendy 's ( brenda song ) teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks , that was pretty ridiculous to . so to sumamrize it all , a disappointing movie , but okay if you 're 10 or under .
this was just plain terrible . i read this book for school , i made as on all of the tests , and to see it like this ! my teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it , and it was worse than leonard part 6 , plan 9 from outer space , and hudson hawk put together . the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over . first of all , it was made on hallmark . second , the acting was terrible . third , it was like completely different from the book . literally , it was so bad i asked myself to be excused . basically , i would rather watch basic instinct 2 than watch this . take my advice , do n't watch this film . no one would want to watch this . it was horrible . horrible !
put a dvd of this flick in a time capsule , and it will definitely illustrate for future generations a perfect example of one which warrants the minimal rating on a 1-to-10-star scale . bill cosby and ray romano have been at the top - in ratings and with tens of millions in earnings annually - with their television series ' . yet each has had no success in big-screen offerings . this has also been true for other tv personalities - perhaps because many of the stories which are presented for two hours or so seem more suited to either a 10-minute skit , or at most , the 22 or 23 minutes of drama during a half-hour program . this film , however , does n't have one single element which would warrant two or three minutes of time on mad tv , snl , or anywhere else on a screen or stage . its origination date is listed as 2002 , but release date - to dvd only - is shown as 2004 . it also was filmed not long before rodney dangerfield 's death , so its one redeeming value is that it probably provided at lease a few hundred thousand more dollars for his heirs . i 'd never heard of it , but found it when turning-on my set , and frankly became fascinated by it . some movies are so truly awful that they rate a sort of top rating in reverse - so bad that you can move the dial backwards to a 9 or 10 . `` plan 9 from outer space '' is the best example - and the bruce jenner/village people opus , `` ca n't stop the music , '' is another . unfortunately this flick falls short even there . even if rodney 's earlier work ( as well as some of his fellow cast-members ' ) fell short of `` citizen kane '' or `` casablanca , '' there were many moments of humor and a story providing at least a modicum of interest . unfortunately , this presentation does n't seem to possess even a minute or two 's worth of such material .
to be a buster keaton fan is to have your heart broken on a regular basis . most of us first encounter keaton in one of the brilliant feature films from his great period of independent production : 'the general ' , 'the navigator ' , 'sherlock jnr ' . we recognise him as the greatest figure in the entire history of film comedy , and we want to see more of his movies . here the heartbreak begins . after 'steamboat bill jnr ' , keaton 's brother-in-law joseph schenck pressured him into signing a contract that put keaton under the control of mgm . keaton became just one more actor for hire , performing someone else 's scripts . then his alcoholism got worse . after 'steamboat bill jnr ' , keaton never again made a truly first-rate film . a couple of sources describe a would-be masterpiece comedy that keaton claimed he * almost * got to make at mgm : a parody of 'grand hotel ' . biographer tom dardis has offered convincing evidence that keaton made up this story . the heartbreak increases because , among the many years of keaton 's long steady decline , he just occasionally came up with a good film ... such as his short comedy 'grand slam opera ' . i continue to search for the lost footage of keaton 's dramatic scene with spencer tracy in 'it 's a mad mad world ' : a sequence in which embittered cop tracy telephones an old retired crook ( keaton ) and tries to recruit his assistance in stealing smiler grogan 's cash . that footage is almost certainly gone forever , but i keep looking . 'speak easily ' , alas , is one of keaton 's films from the beginning of his decline . mgm were trying to build up jimmy durante ( who , coincidentally , played smiler grogan three decades later ) as a new comedy star . unfortunately , mgm tried to build up durante by teaming him with keaton , whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with durante 's . ( i 'm a fan of both . ) throughout his career , durante was a merciless scene-stealer : commendably , he knew that he was being built up at keaton 's expense , and keaton was the only co-star whom durante never attempted to upstage . keaton was often cast as the victim of extremely cruel machinations . in 'speak easily ' , he plays a didactic and humourless midwestern college professor named post ( because he 's as wooden as one ) who receives a letter informing him that he 's inherited $ 750,000 , which he must travel to new york city to claim . does he make a 'phone call to verify this ? does he even check the postmark ? no ; he takes his life 's savings out of the bank and rushes to new york . as soon as he 's gone , post 's manservant confesses that he wrote the ( fake ) letter to jostle professor post out of his rut ! post , who thinks he 's a 3/4-millionaire , crosses paths with jimmy dodge ( durante ) , who 's trying to produce a musical revue but has n't any money . the characters which these two brilliant comedians are playing onscreen simply fail to intermesh . keaton is playing one of those eggheads ( like mister logic in 'viz ' ) who intellectualises everything . durante plays one of those annoying hepcats who is incapable of making any straightforward statement because the script requires him always to speak in slang . there 's a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which durante is trying to talk to keaton about money , but - instead of coming straight out with it - durante has to use increasingly contrived slang terms like 'kale ' , 'cartwheels ' and so forth ... while keaton of course has no idea what durante 's on about . i 'll give keaton credit : his own dry and dusty prairie voice , his flat kansas accent , is absolutely perfect for the character he 's playing here . sidney toler , looking much leaner and more handsome here than he would be just a year later , is impressive as the excitable director of the revue bankrolled ( on tick ) by professor post . henry armetta , whom i 've never found funny , is even less funny than usual here , offering a running gag with a stupid payoff . thelma todd impressed me here , in a more villainous version of the role she played in 'horse feathers ' ( a much funnier movie ) . edward brophy , one of my favourite character actors , is wasted . part of the problem with 'speak easily ' is that supporting characters behave in completely inappropriate ways . keaton 's lawyer shows up at durante 's theatre with an urgent message for keaton ... but he is n't there , so the lawyer proceeds to divulge keaton 's personal business to the first total stranger he meets . ( fire that lawyer , buster ! ) in another scene , professor post - the guy who 's perceived as bankrolling this musical - blunders into the chorus girls ' changing room , and all the chorus girls immediately squeal and cover themselves . i know for a fact that * modern * chorus girls would never react this way , and i seriously doubt that chorus girls in 1932 behaved that way either ... certainly not in response to the 'angel ' controlling their show 's pursestrings . spoilers coming . about half an hour into the unfunny 'speak easily ' , the great jimmy durante seats himself at the piano , grins into the camera , and does that distinctive little shake of his head as he starts to play a tune . this is the moment when i thought that , at long last , this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us . alas , no . most annoying of all is the ending of this film , which uses the single most hackneyed and implausible cliche in all of comedy : the one in which an utterly incompetent dimwit becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude . ( keaton would be forced to replay this cliche in a 1955 episode of 'screen directors playhouse ' ; chaplin had already used it in 'the circus ' . ) i very nearly wept - in anger and sorrow - at the wasted opportunities in 'speak easily ' . mostly out of respect for the work that keaton , durante , toler , brophy and miss todd have done elsewhere , i 'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 .
when the folks at kino video assembled their fine `` slapstick encyclopedia '' collection , a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies , someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many ( 1916 ) , an obscure one-reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy . as enjoyable as the set is over all , this decision was an unfortunate one , for one too many is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further . like any typical farce , this one involves deception inspired by greed , panic when plans go awry , and complications escalating to the point of absurdity , but unlike the good ones , one too many is incoherent , unfunny , and downright annoying . it 's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film-making , but whatever the cause , by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening , and by the end one no longer cares . the only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year-old `` babe '' hardy , who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel , but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy . in the opening scene , awakening with a hangover , babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed . trust me , that 's as funny as this movie gets . if you read this before seeing the first cassette of kino 's `` slapstick encyclopedia '' i suggest you fast-forward past this one and skip to the good stuff .
there are no spoilers here ... because there is no plot to spoil . madchen amick is living proof a face can make a living acting -- no talent required . the only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by alice krige , but then again , she is alice krige . her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be . she is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot . how they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery . the screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script . it has major continuity problems , superficial stereotypical characters , horror formula writing , and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever . the creatures , while they have neat skills like going `` dim '' , the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored . do n't waste any time on this one .
i do n't want to go off on a rant here , but ..... this is the worst `` film '' i 've ever seen . worse than the avengers . incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout . shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion . the lighting frequently looks like a single sun-gun . the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful . the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . it 's not even bad enough to be funny . it 's just bad . btw , the packaging is intentionally misleading . lion 's gate owes me $ 4.00 .
this film has got several key flaws . the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot ! this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness , as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life . this means that the film can not captivate it 's audience , instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it ! in short , it really is very very very very very very very bad ! do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe , you 'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman .
i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly . i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful . it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great , or i would n't have bothered to see it the other day . i like supporting indie cinema , especially if they are gay-themed , but this movie is almost too much to tolerate . those that walked out , as i considered doing after about three minutes , probably did n't mind shelling out $ 11.00 , or just figured it was going nowhere , fast , and not going to improve . maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are .. either that or they did n't pay to get in in the first place . logan is bored . he 's a klutz . he 's gay . i 'm okay with that . the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also ! there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry , re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene , and the second scene , etc. , etc ... nothing or no one goes anywhere . no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting . probably most appalling of all is that i did n't feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan . that in itself is a major accomplishment . he did n't grow , he did n't change , he did n't learn ( there is no one to teach him anything ) , he did n't do anything , and neither did the movie ! scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make . additionally , the title makes no sense at all . 1/10 .
what a fantastic premise : a movie about the berlin airlift . it should have it all . tragedy . suspense . comradeship . rivals . berliner frauleins and tough us pilots . love and tears . what we 've got , is a film with none of the above . heino ferch tries to impersonate john wayne or so , but he fails miserably . he acts so wooden , that at any given moment he should crack . he tries to play the tough guy , instead of being a tough guy ! why would bettina zimmermann 's character fall in love with him ? cause they were throwing stones in a lake ? cause he brings her coal bricks ? the sfx are very , very well done . too much though . the hundreds or so planes over berlin , look like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron rather than an organised airlift  as it actually was . interestingly enough , the white house , the kremlin , and general lucius d. clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set . notice the same drapes , hanging deep down the windows , as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout . why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty ? by the way , general lucius d. clay , comes across as a small time , insecure , looser general , who doest trust in his own noble idea the airlift . he was very much the opposite . so you combine all those individual blunders and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion , no suspense and no historic accuracy . sad , it started out so promising
the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life . but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement . the acting , directing , cinematography , and storyline were all horrible . i would never recommend this movie to anyone . i 've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie ! i did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly , but they have left out too many key components of the book . the movie tried , but failed , to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy . while putting myself in the position who had not read the book , i saw the celestine prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy b.s . i am thoroughly disappointed with redfield for the way this movie turned out .
i would list this film under the horror film genre.i did this because i am not aware of a genre called horrible . since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible i have decided to put it in this category . the acting was amateurish . you know who the villains would be at the first scene . the heroine is as ugly as the movie . students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie . it is that bad . man the word bad is an understatement . the villains hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars . they want the money to be delivered on an inhabited rose island in the middle of the pacific . they would be sitting ducks after they got the money . is there no getaway plan . how dumb . the female cruise director is a former cop , navy seal , kung fu i am scared . the hilarious part is the way the defuses the time bomb . he says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one . he then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place . is he mad ? as mad us who watched this ridiculous . if you have a m-i-l whom you do not like . to annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it . i assure you she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son/daughter has married a person below her family standard .
what a wasted cast . this is one of the most disappointing films i 've seen . usually roger ebert does not let me down , but i feel cheated after seeing this movie . the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra . that is a sorry statement about this movie . it held so much promise , but it was like dry humping a transvestite . this is self absorbed tripe . i can not express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie , and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment .
recap : something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica . the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica . julian rome , a former seti-worker , is brought in to decipher the message . problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his , and the situation quickly turns awkward , especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him . and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly . soon the object is in the open . the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity . it is decided to open the object , but just before that is done , julian decodes the signal . `` do not open '' . but too late , and the object explodes as it is finally breached , and two things unleashed on earth . the first is an alien , that had been dormant in the object , and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff . and washington , that is suspiciously updated on this historic event , decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth . so a russian nuclear submarine , carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica . comments : the movie holds a few surprises . one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance , and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful , well worked through and a lot better than expected . unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own , and this time not in a good way . actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes . it is never really explained why washington know so much , why washington is able to command russian submarines , why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now . it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english . some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language ( and obviously chose english , why ? ) . but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus , send their `` do not open '' message encoded ! and finally the end is as open as an end can be . the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy ( from me ) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot . therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good . 3/10
roeg has done some great movies , but this a turkey . it has a feel of a play written by an untalented high-school student for his class assignment . the set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way , but the actual story is insufferable hokum .
man , this was hilarious . it should be under comedy . or stupid . it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier . seriously ? i want anyone associated with this movie tased , effective immediately . for everyone who is thinking of watching this `` movie '' , let '' s go over a few plot points . oh , wait . there are n't any . there is literally no plot . i think casper van dien was bored , and he decided to film something with some random someones , and miraculously , it somehow got on videotape . this movie is literally the worst movie of all time . do n't believe me ? go watch it . do it , man . i dare you . but be prepared to gouge your eyes out . if you can sit through this without blowing a cow , you are very strong and courageous .
if fassbinder has made a worse film , i sure do n't want to see it ! anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this , to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like `` the bitter tears of petra von kant '' . this film bogs down with so much arty , quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of an `` art-film '' . the scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where elvira 's prostitute friend channel-surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer 's endurance . but what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just elvira and her ex-wife and/or her daughter . these are the only moments that display any real human emotion , and prove that at the core of this horrible film , there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . what a waste .
having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about . unfortunately , a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen , samurai , the geisha world of kyoto originate from . some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese surroundings.the geisha dances were not authentic . there was far too much use of chinese music . a minor but essential detail : proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen . the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! interestingly , some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons .
after just watching five across the eyes , i got ta be honest ... i just did n't like it . i had read so many good reviews on this movie , but i just did'nt get where these reviews have came from , i have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making , and i 'm sure the directors will do well for themselves , but the budget they had was the main problem , there was two cameras used in the entire film ( which was ok ) but they seemed like really cheap cameras . another problem was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - it 's just impossible to hear what they 're saying . it had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so ! ... and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape , but do n't ! very frustrating ... i only just scraped through this one !
i do n't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it 's over if you were ever scared . this does n't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film does n't tack on one of those happy endings . story is about an american couple who travel to kyoto , japan so that ted fletcher ( edward albert ) can write a book and he brings along his wife laura ( susan george ) and their daughter amy ( amy barrett ) . their friend alex curtis ( doug mcclure ) who works at the american consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . about 140 years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the fletcher 's arrive it does n't take long before strange things start happening . * * * * * spoiler alert * * * * * at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the fletcher 's and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to flirt with alex which leads to an affair . meanwhile , ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help . unfortunately the ghosts get ted , laura , and alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier . this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with mcclure on some of them . while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked . first , it does n't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . instead , it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . secondly , it has susan george in the cast ! i 've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does n't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it 's one of the reasons why she was so popular . but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . this is n't a bad film but it 's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career .
my commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film . in fact , they 're quite congruent with mine . what gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie , it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story , motive or dialogue . maybe someone should tell neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience is n't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director . a silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of neal young . the most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar , slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero , who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to young song to the heroine , who is unaware of what 's taken place . somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the west coast in search of ? ? ? ? ? sorry neal , stick with music and leave film making to steven stills .
why else would he do this to me ? not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies . or even decent movies . i saw lois and clark , i am aware of just how ... `` good '' dean cain is . obviously this is gon na be a cheesey flick , and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head . i will not call these spoilers as you ca n't really spoil this movie any more than it already is . to begin with ... why is that a fake helicopter ? i mean ... why ? how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried ? how hard would it have been to get either an american actor , or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people are n't american ? why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line ? we get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on . and then that 's it , who cares about the timeline . to be honest , who cared about it even when they mentioned it , but i guess that 's beside the point . does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens ? the answer is no . that dragon sure can walk down that hall .. over .. and over ... and over .... and over ... who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history ? it was straight out of scooby doo . oh , the dragon 's dead now ... say , wan na get dinner ? sure , but not at some chinese place .... with dragon in the name ! ! ah ha ha ha ! ! ha ha ha ! ! haha ha ! i used to be superman ! aha ha ha ! ha ha ! fade to black my god , it made me cringe it was so stupid . but never fear .. even though the whole building exploded ... and no one was left alive .. for some reason there 's a second untouched , unmanned lab that survived pretty well , so they can make a sequel . hurray for us all .
i remember my parents not understanding saturday night live when i was 15 . they also did not understand rock n roll and many other things . now that i am approaching their age , i still remember , and find i understand many of the things my kids love . but this is pathetic . i can not say i have seen any by sarah except for a few appearances here and there . they were reasonable . i do not see her as anything special . but this show is just so far below what i expected from her . the imdb write up made it sound like potential . so , just for that , i started watching the first episode . i turned it off half way through . anything else is better that that . jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program . well , sarah , this adult is inly moved to turn you off . i just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy . only good thing i can say is that there are sooooo many bad jokes deposited here , saving other shows from such an embarrassment .
for anyone craving a remake of 1989 's slaves of new york . what are there , seven of you ? here it is ... was . this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters ( well they 're club-kids , ya big jerk ! ) that are in holding patterns . the big question seems to be , just how long can a young adult remain juvenile ? it took three people to write this 'story ' ? good god , it was easier to come up with citizen kane . rather than take viewers back , this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene-ster in the early 90s . the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self-absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self-absorbed , twenty-somethings could imagine it . the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub-plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey 's breakin 2 : electric bugaloo . her `` i 'm serious about graduate school ! '' while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical . posey 's shtick is always amusing , but there are projects that are beneath her . i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark .
something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot . the movie , that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema , fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making . the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning , that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake . the editing is poor . direction is crap . acting is out of this world ( omg ) ! the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes . i would n't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it .
collusion course is even worse than the typical `` evil white male corporate capitalist '' movie of the week . this movie is less pleasant than a toothache . jay leno can act . he 's good in his underrated debut movie , the silverbears , in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character . this movie is so bad leno 's character , a sanctimonious buffoon , is less annoying than morita 's character , a sanctimonious fool .
ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music , it 's wrong on so many fronts that it 's laughable . tommy quickly ? the honeycombs ? the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group , two by the animals , and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout ( all 1:20 ) . but all in all , an awkward display of british music circa 1964 . oh , and herman 's hermits .
i liked it , i really did . please do n't think that i 'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film . i expected it to be crap , it was crap , but sometimes its ok to relax and watch a crappy film that you do n't have to concentrate too much on is n't it ? i did n't expect any hidden meanings or morales , and there was n't any , but that does n't matter because i only watched it for entertainment , and it did entertain me throughout . films like this are why the ben stillers ( excusing 'there 's something about mary ' ) and the vince vaughns ( however you spell his last name , i could n't be bothered checking ) have jobs . it 's ok to watch a crap film as long as you do n't expect too much from it , and i for one shall take a stand , jog , perhaps run , but not drive because i do n't have a car , to blockbuster video , or even choices , and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them . good day to you reader . p.s if you do not say that this comment helped you then i do n't like you , if you do say it helped then god bless you , you will go to heaven .
if bob ludlum was to see this mini series , he would have cried . this was complete waste of time and money . i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be , cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum 's work . may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was . poor mira , blair , anjelica and colm , why did they sign to stoop this low ? horrible ! !
in film , i feel as though it should be more than just art . i think it should be more than that , a way to tell a story on screen . this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one . i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy . it is good film-making but there really is n't anything else to it . as i 've said before , i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i do n't see a need for it at all . this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he 's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future . if you like lynch , check this out but do n't be surprised when you do n't like it very much .
in what would be his first screenplay , based on his own short story `` turn about , '' william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty , sacrifice , and really strange relationships . the story originally was about only the tone , young , and cooper characters , but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract , and faulkner obliged by creating a female role . crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars ' young and tone , leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch ( `` wuthering heights '' performed in semaphore ) . seriously , the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james . the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes , with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister ( as may be found in his `` sanctuary , '' and elsewhere ) . when young proposes to crawford , in tone 's presence , in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another . the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable , especially as they go off to their thelma & louise fate . frankly , it 's creepy . not as creepy to this new yorker , however , as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach , wellington , which crawford cheerfully catches ( and which is shown gamboling over her hands -- i had to turn away ! ) and young turns into a gladiator . blech . that being said , there are some nice performances . young is particularly engaging in a scene where he 's taken up in cooper 's fighter plane , and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper 's flying buddy . tone , despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue , has a nice moment , dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young 's fate . crawford , stripped of meaningful dialogue as well , mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic , which is quite a balancing act for one role . the battle scenes -- not surprisingly , for a howard hawks film -- are the most exciting part of the entire picture . but not enough . as far as i 'm concerned , this is 75 minutes of my life i 'm never going to get back .
the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy . seen in that light , it does deliver . if you 're looking for a serious movie , look somewhere else . this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of `` issues '' with no insight whatsoever . making a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy - especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable , stereotypical ways . busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable , and michael rappaport turns in a good performance , but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite , it 's hard to find anything redeeming .
i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely . having , unfortunately , dealt with lucas at such a young age , howard is now caught up in so many of lucas ' traits . how else do you explain his rampage of disasters ? his only useful film , of course , has been 'willow ' . everything else , including this , is too reliant on superficial junk . some spoilers . he ca n't even have semi-intelligent focus like peter weir . no , poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten . here we have the old adage : `` love conquers all , even disease . '' too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill . heck , even disney did better than this . ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities . howard 's commentary track is just awful . do n't even rent the dvd . final analysis = = cinematic dud
i know that movies are n't necessarily supposed to mirror reality , but this one got on my nerves . it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about `` psychological trauma '' and mental illness . the `` psycho mom '' thing has been done too many times before ( and usually done better ) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well . the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about . one highlight : i am a long-time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular , jon lindstrom . anyway , if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it , in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies , then this movie might be tolerable . if you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards . i 'm sorry i spent my time watching it .
this is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of adolf hitler that i have ever watched . robert carlyle is a wonderful actor , but to cast him as hitler is just plain wrong . to cast liev schrieber as hitler 's longtime friend and aid , haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the simon wiesenthal centre . a j-w playing a nazi supporter , bad bad bad casting . this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background . this was hollywood rubbish at its finest , cashing in on the strength of a strong ( but sorely under utilized ) supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years . the fake german accents ( vee vill vin zis var ) is insulting to german people everywhere . my mother is german and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from american/english/german all in the same sentence . the supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen . jenna malone as the fated geli raubal , was splendid though , she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in hitler 's shadow . if you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of hitler 's early years leading up to and including the war/holocaust , rent `` inside the third reich '' 1983 starring rutger hauer as albert speer and derek jacobi as hitler . it was good and made more sense then this baloney . as a historical researcher of the third reich i can honestly tell you , this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies .
this series just gets worse and worse . poorly written and just plain not funny ! the premise is excellent , but the writer 's inexperience shines through . by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , `` oh , silly you '' style acting that comes with a no laugh script . they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , are n't we zany ? is n't this funny ? well , no , it 's not actually . gum disease is less painful . no wonder , with the exception of corner gas , canadians generally avoid canadian tv . come on cbc you 're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent . pull the plug on this amateurish mess .
`` the brain machine '' will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it 's all about . four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment . since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed . the whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as the general , but it seems he 's taking his direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous . good call there on the senator 's part . there 's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on , who later claims he does n't take his direction from the general or 'the project ' . too bad he was n't more effective , he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey . if nothing else , the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970 's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones , room size computers and a teletype machine that wo n't quit . perhaps that was the basis of the film 's alternate title - `` time warp '' ; nothing else would make any sense . as for myself , i 'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered dr. krisner 's experiment titled 'group stress project ' . it applies to the film 's actors and viewers alike . keep an eye out just above the general 's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon , a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds . you may want to catch this flick if you 're a die hard gerald mcraney fan , could he have ever been that young ? james best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend , but do n't call him father . for something a little more up his alley , try to get your hands on 1959 's `` the killer shrews '' . that one at least does n't pretend to take itself so seriously .
rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . actors of stature - robert duvall , robert downey , jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere ; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens ; a writer ( john grisham ) who has never produced anything of merit , discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence . the film has a cheap , lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic . normally , i come on to the imdb to write balanced , generally appreciative comments . this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless , bilious rant . i wo n't , but only because i no longer want to occupy my `` mind '' with this trash .
this `` film '' is a travesty . no , wait -- an abomination . no , wait -- this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors . i thought `` inspector clouseau '' with alan arkin ( ! ) instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious , but even daring to `` remake '' stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money grubbing . mr. laurel and mr. hardy have been dead , respectively , since 1957 and 1965 . why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l & h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me . i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly was n't disappointed . everyone involved in this pathetic , moronic , disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film-making . avoid this movie at all costs -- you have been duly warned .
faith domergue ( better known as `` dr. ruth '' in this island earth ) is the only reason to watch this film . the story is very thin , and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game . see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest is n't happening .
* * spoilers * * this was an ugly movie , and i 'm sorry that i watched it . like jan kounen 's dobermann , it suffers mostly from poor editing -- or lack of it . it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention , he added all of the footage he had shot together . there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie . one of them is * spoiler * when benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him . that was cool -- but okay , we got it ! move on please ! the camera wo n't stop spinning around this guy ! there 's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this flood of mediocrity , but the last duel scene is not one of them ! it may be because unlike in the earlier sword-handling scenes , shanao is n't masked -- but just because the director could n't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled asano tadanobu does n't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 % of the sword fight with extreme close-ups of sword clashes ! and all from the same angle , may i add . the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet-train ninja movie the hunted ! i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years . the situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media , due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority . the movie versions of gto and salary man kintaro are two other recent examples * end spoiler * i do n't understand . i just do n't understand why people who do n't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this . maybe the worst was lost in the translation . the ending of the movie -- on which marketing played a lot , is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between shanao and benkei . but that legend is not the most popular in japanese folklore , and it is so detached from contemporary themes , that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques , who cares how the director wants to re-interpret the story ! ? director sasaki hirohisa of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences , and target their movies for foreign film festivals -- in order to gain faster international fame . this works , although it does n't make sense , because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries-what kind of movies people watch in those countries . certainly not gojoe and the like .
maybe i 've seen one too many crime flick , or maybe i do n't take the right drugs . this was the most cliché ridden , plot deficient , plot-absurd , just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time . as for the direction , it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together . in fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed . it 's a bad rip off of `` m '' the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre . you 'd be so much better off renting that instead .
in the many films i have seen warren oates , i have come to a definite conclusion , here is one talented individual . i first saw mr. oates back in the 1960 's television series called stoney burke . from then on , i followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles . that happened in 1974 , when sam peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called 'bring me the head of alfredo garcia . ' of course , his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'the wild bunch ' . i have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic , that is until i saw him in this flop . the movie is called `` chandler `` , a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950 's created by raymond chandler . because , the synopsis said it was about a hard nose private eye , i was immediately interested . however , i sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull , dis-interesting , slow pace , twisted , confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self . collectively and with some of hollywood 's best supporting stars , such as alex dreier , mitch ryan , gordon pinsent , charles mcgraw , richard loo and scatman crothers , this movie had enough power to reach mach five , however , it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where . as a result , one of my favorite actor 's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground . * *
blue monkey ( 1987 ) or 'invasion of the bodysuckers ' as it 's known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant ! ! ! ! the man gets rushed to hospital , where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth , of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage ! ! despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie , i found it to be boring , with a flat predictable storyline , un-interesting characters , cheap special effects and lack of action ! ! ! ! horror fans do n't really need to track this rare movie down , you wont be missing much trust me ! ! ! i give this movie 2/10 .
it must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film . probably cruise , the exec . prod. , saw what was happening and had towne use much , much more of the nude footage in the final cut then towne wanted to , to make up for the disaster he saw looming . ( maybe cruise even thought of `` titanic '' . ) a few items : colin farrell ca n't act his way out of a paper bag . but he 's one of the flavors-of-the-decade , a producer 's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films . he has so many moments of not believing in what he 's doing and you can see it in his eyes . i think he would have been at his best as a film actor , albeit not as rich or famous as he is now , playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act . the trap of spending a lot of money for period sets , costumes , cars , et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash/wax . no one seems to want anything to look , well , worn . or dirty . is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they did n't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items ? this was a story about the depression-thirties folks , not a disney broadway musical about that era . how about doing it in black and white or better yet , given caleb deschanel as your d.p. , have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times . it should have been , after all , a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did , in the depression . more on farrell . did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer ? h.l . mencken on the wall ; did i see his eyes roll at one point ? hayek and farrell as a sexually dynamic duo ? sending a boy to do a man 's work ? perhaps in the book , which i have n't read , the story was about an older woman and a youth . i can not delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because i bailed out early on . but the memory of the scenes i did see made me think that someone was doing a not-too-amusing parody of a noir movie . sort of what saturday night live has been like for the past decade : not funny . ( in my mind i kept thinking of a guy noir sketch , music and all . )
there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam , and he was whack his rhymes were corny , this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin , bad casting , bad special effects whats next ? this movie sucks prolly did n't make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... yeah , you get it , a stupid rhyming genie who ca n't act , in a stupid movie with horrible special effects . oh , and its confusing as hell . i 'm not even gon na go on . let 's just say , it belongs in the `` its so bad , its funny '' category . watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh . but do n't expect anything spectacular .
my friends and i rented this for `` bad movie night '' with high hopes , but the brain was something of a letdown . the brain itself is gloriously goofy-looking , but it mostly just sits on its little platform . who thought that it would be cool that the brain only gets to munch on three people throughout 94 drawn-out minutes ? this movie has a number of things going for it at first , including an estevez-knockoff lead playing a rebellious genius ( we 're told that his enormous intellect is misdirected into his elaborate pranks and school stunts , which include putting krazy glue on someone 's chair ) . it also has some great lines , a hilariously out-of-shape and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere , and , yeah , some chick gets naked . however , the director desperately needs some schooling in the art of pacing . during the last half things just start to drag on and on , with at least 3 or 4 pointless , boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot . the scenes inside the pri complex are especially bad . at least 15 minutes of this movie are people running up and down the same stairwell . i could 've fixed the screenplay to this thing in half an hour- more cheese , more gore , more nudity , more brain action . if you 're going to make a bad horror movie , at least give me something cool to look at while my superego shuts down . maybe the director was trying to really bring the audience into his movie- i started feeling like one of the zombified townsfolk by the end of this crapfest .
despite its interesting premise , 'sniper ' is quite tedious . with a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying ; instead it plods along with little tension .
whoever wrote up `` redline '' as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming , steaming pile of amateur crap . easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made . this makes showgirls look like citizen kane . take every cheesy cliché out of an 80s action tv series , put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business . this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever . what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap .
just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris . then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you 've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery 's wife ( a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw ) and kid ( a very young scarlet johannsen ) in an alligator skinner 's shack . the kind of movie that 's probably best seen on a plane , and even then only once .
when i was at the movie store the other day , i passed up blonde and blonder , but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie . who knows ? i mean , i 'm sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it , blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up . but when i started watching it : executive producer pamela anderson , wow , i knew i was in for something scary . not only that , but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness : pam anderson and denise richards , not to offend them , but they were not aging well at all and they 're playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20 's , not their 40 's . the story was just plain bad and obnoxious . dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde 's , they really do n't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world , it 's just really sad . but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins , the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their `` ignorance is bliss '' attitudes . they are set up to make a `` hit '' on a guy , and they think they 're just going to `` show him a good time '' , but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls . denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before . i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy , but it was more than stupid , it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary . would i ever recommend this ? not in a million years , the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as `` sex kittens '' , it 's more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell . 1/10
seriously , i mean very seriously , when i first started watching the show i thought it was good . but the plots just got worse . the storyline were either too boring or predictable . george is n't always funny , he sometimes acts stupid . his jokes are overdone . his mom is the silliest character of the show . how can a mother treat her own son that way , okay if it was the daughter in law , but this was her own son . i give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny . the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job . do n't know how these shows get to play for so long . if you 're really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch , i 'd suggest you watch this .
except people apparently buy into this garbage ! as shows like `` moral orel '' have shown , even if you tried to make the most outrageous , over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of , it would n't come close to the hilarity of this show . it 's hard to tell what 's even going on when you 're watching it . is it a news show ? a talk show ? who knows ! ? they start out by reporting on various international news stories , but at seemingly random points , the news is interrupted by this odd , troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face , mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy . pat robertson does n't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance . he just seems like a senile , yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs ( like most of our grandparents ) . but this is a man who has called for an assassination , who has befriended and offered aid to not one , but two murderous dictators , who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines , who has supported forced abortions in china , and who regularly implies that caucasians ( straight american male caucasians in particular ) are superior to all other races . still , this would all be funny , except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later ( either that , or enough money to bribe some tv executives who do n't give a damn what they show ) . the idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people , somewhere , must be watching it and hanging onto every word . even when robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is , people still listen to him . i do n't know if it 's funny or scary . i guess a healthy mixture of both .
this movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that i 've spent in a very , very long time . if you knew how often i went to the movies you 'd probably say , that 's hard to imagine , but never-the-less , it 's true ! after seeing the trailer for this movie , i knew that i had to see it ! if you 're a fan of horror , mystery , and suspense , why would n't you ? the trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting ; unfortunately , the movie is none of these . from the cinematography , to the script , to the acting , this movie is a complete flop . if you 're reading this , planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills , mystery , action , horror , or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes i 'm afraid you are in for disappointment . `` why is it so bad , '' you might be asking yourself . let me tell you . the movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful . nothing about the movie made me the least bit `` on edge , '' frightened , or curious . the script was at best laughable . there were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous i began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it was n't . the acting was absolutely dreadful . i like nicholas cage but this was a miss . without exception , every performance in this movie was incredibly below average . the cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique . finally , the story is completely transparent . you can see the end of this movie coming a mile away . i am not usually a very harsh critic . frankly , when i go to see a comedy i want to laugh and when i go to see a mystery/suspense/horror , i just want to be surprised . this movie was boring , poorly acted , poorly written , and an overwhelming disappointment . do yourself a favor and go see something else .
snow white , which just came out in locarno , where i had the chance to see it , of course refers to the world famous fairy tale . and it also refers to coke . in the end , real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as well . thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film . there is a lot of dope on scene , and there is also a pale , dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue . but : it 's not a fairy tale . it 's supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich , switzerland ( according to the tagline ) . technically the movie is close to perfect . unfortunately a weak plot , foreseeable dialogs , a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting do n't add up to create authenticity . thus as a spectator i remained untouched . and then there were the clichés , which drove me crazy one by one : snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them , because they were so busy all the time . her best girlfriend , on the other hand , has loving and caring parents . they ( a steelworker and a housewife ) live in a tiny flat , poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in . the good guy ( = prince ) is a musician ( ! ) from the french speaking part of switzerland ( which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country ) . he has problems with his parents . they are migrants from spain , who do n't seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed . and so it goes on : naturally , the drug dealer is brutal , the bankers are heartless , the club owner is a playboy and the photographer , although a woman ( ! ) , has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a show . this review does n't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot . as i like other films by samir , e.g . `` forget baghdad '' , i was quite disappointed . let 's hope for the next one .
i am a major fan of the horror genre ! i love horror/slasher/gore flicks of all kinds . some of my favorites are the really `` good '' bad horror flicks . but this movies has nothing to warrant it 's viewing ! ! i 'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that 's wrong with it . the script is horrid . the acting is horrid . the fx are not even worth discussing . the `` set '' is an absolute joke ! ! the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors , but this vehicle left them nothing to work with ! ! ! suffice it to say i saw it for `` free '' & feel i was robbed ! ! the time you 'd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat .
i have no idea why they made this version of `` persuasion '' when they already had that fine mini-series with amanda root and ciaran hinds . i suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version , but of course a lot had to be deleted ; alas , what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour , leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of english country manners and mores . also , the characters were shallow and uninteresting . they had poor anne chasing up and down the streets after captain wentworth like a silly modern adolescent ( and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this , let me tell you : running after a male like a female in heat is not cool ) . that is something a well-bred woman of the napoleonic era would never have done , and certainly not this level-headed heroine . some have said they found this antic laughable ; my reaction was not laughter , but outrage . the very idea of such a corruption of an austen work is beneath contempt . it was ghastly .
i read the reviews of this movie , and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it . i 'm a big francophile and art film lover , but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something `` arty '' or `` intellectual '' into something it is not . i will be blunt : it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never , ever wanted to actually see . obviously , the piano teacher has some major psychological issues , but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically . the film is , in essence , disgusting . i mean , when i saw requiem for a dream , i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly , but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film .
ziab la ta'kol al lahem is an awful movie.this is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link.acting is also very bad , despite the presence of a good actor like ezzat el allayli . but something is really astonishing in this movie , talking about sexuality , emancipation of women , nude scenes are very rare in arab cinema , even in this days . i really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage . we want to see more of this style in egyptian movies , but with better quality . the reasons that led me to vote this film as an awful one are not only scenario and acting , but also the lack of prfessionalism . this movie look like an amateur one.we can see a lot of errors in the screen . if you want a good arab movie ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the one recommended.but if you wish to encourage the uncensored movies in all the arab world watch it and make your friends and your family do the same .
this movie proves that you ca n't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover . it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it ( or get it for someone at christmas ) . the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising . well , until you meet the characters . pumpkin jack ( the old guy from down the street ) brings the college co-eds a book full of witch 's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house ( where the movie takes place ) . after that there is some drinking , fighting , and soft core porn . then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour . overall , hallow 's end was predictable , unsuspensful , and reminiscent of a soft-core porn . this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do , as it is a good movie to make fun of . and for first-time viewers , it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die .
amy heckerling 's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930 's gangster films made in the warner brothers ' tradition . michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 . keaton 's mother ( maureen stapleton ) has continuing health problems , so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle . meanwhile , the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks . joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin , yeah that 's right , vermin ! griffin dunne is keaton 's younger brother turned district attorney , glynnis o'connor his wife , and marilu henner plays keaton 's moll . the film looks notoriously cheap , making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film . the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour . due to the combination of dialog and gags , the film holds its own for the first half , but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half . keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression . stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious , not funny . piscopo does the `` once '' bit one time too many . several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito , dom deluise , ray walston as a street vendor , alan hale , jr. as a desk sergeant , and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady . the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers . the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film . i think heckerling should have known better , since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties ' actual 1939 release date . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
the only thing remarkable about this movie ? is that all the actors could bomb at the same time . idiocy . i want my money back ... and i got it free from the library . sheesh . i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again .
i ca n't think of much to say about this film . this was an awful movie ... i ca n't even tell you what made me decide to view it . it had so few redeeming qualities that i do n't even know where to begin . the plot moved from implausible to downright absurd . my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done . by the end of the movie , i found myself feeling beyond relieved . the editing was poor , the acting was sub-par , and the storyline was weak . francoise robinson was cast as a native american , even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage . if a movie is going to be this idiotic , it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least . it was n't . it was just pathetic .
i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly . the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired . the opening scenes were about as intense , meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting , robin hood had no character , and the sword fight was just laughable . the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century ? nobody . the series may have improved drastically since then , but this first episode quickly put people 's hopes down , and is essentially a pile of cr * p. a great hero of england has been disgraced . `` will you tolerate this ? '' i wo n't , that 's for sure , unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment . 3/10
the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear . sadly , they stopped there . they should have continued to make the script disappear , then the silly set , and finally every visible element of this film . because , there 's nothing else there to show . gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film . i do n't really think they exist . i think they bought this script at `` scripts-r-us '' , where you buy a standard blank `` monster movie '' script and just fill in the blanks . there 's a monster stalking us . let 's split up . ( they actually `` let 's split up '' in this movie ) . hit alien/giant-bug/monster/invisible-man with crowbar . not dead yet . burn huge-rabbit/shark/invisible-man in unsurvivable fire . not dead yet . you know , the standard stuff . even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie ( ir glasses , spraying with something like paint ) were handled badly . what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie . they psychological issues for the subject , the deterioration of the mind due to the process , treating an invisible subject , and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting . had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end , it would have been a much better movie . all in all , it stunk . i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie , but i do n't want to do any spoilers . suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they do n't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than ...
t.z . post , college professor , receives a false letter stating he inherited $ 750,000 . now with financial means , he withdraws his life savings of $ 4,000 , and decides to finally going out & live . after having his baggage sent on a train to chicago , he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe , and decides there good enough for him to put on a show on broadway . the night of the show , poor prof. post has to hide from his creditors , settle the relationship woes between girlfriend pansy and & floozy diva eleanor , and still make sure the show must go on . after watching many of keaton 's silent gems , this one is a pain to sit through , but i felt , it could have been a lot worse . supporting cast durante , todd , & selwyn come off very annoying at times , but still likeable . a pre-charlie chan toler is good as the frustrated show director . 90 % of the script is badly written as mgm is trying to pass this off as a poor man 's marx bros. film where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning . compiled with keaton 's drinking problems at the time , this movie just is a sad moment in buster 's life . rating- 3 .
ever wanted to eat worms ? here 's a 'documentary ' to show you how ! yeah ... the kid eats live worms ! and that 's about the most interesting part of the movie . this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring . i 'm totally in agreement here . the movie just does n't go anywhere .... unless you 're fond of worm eating ! this is one movie it 's almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing much happens . now on the technical side : they should have given that kid a haircut . who 's he trying to look like anyway ... bozo the clown . it was almost comical ... i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something . and on top of that ; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry ! should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming . all in all , this movie nearly put me to sleep . and my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting . i will admit that the scenery was very impressive . and had there been a decent story to go with it , it might have made a hit . it did seem safe enough for kids to watch : the bear scenes and the 'oddball ' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids , and the brief 'skinny-dipping ' scene did n't show anything . i gave this one a very generous 3 .
this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen . again i made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too ( after buying this and the movie `` malevolence '' which i reviewed on here as well , i have learned my lesson ) . i love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm . this supposedly takes place in the woods of texas but was probably filmed in the director 's backyard . the production was probably the worst i ever seen . the actors were absolutely the worst . the story did n't have anything to do with what the back cover said . i even tried to sell it to f.y.e and some other `` mom and pop '' store that buys used dvds and neither would take it . thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was . i have seen some bad movies before ( troll 2 for example ) but this definitely takes the cake . i did n't think there was a worse movie than `` troll 2 '' . boy was i wrong ! do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what i am about to do ! ! ! !
i gave timecop a perfect 10 , i gave this 1 it 's story is very boring , and it has only little to do with the original timecop . lots of things from timecop was scrapped , and they put in new stupid stuff instead . this story is taking place in 2060 ( if i remember correctly ) , but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous : confused : and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about , well most of them are n't ... only the first one is great ... and there are n't many action scenes at all , and they 're all pretty short at one point in the story , the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes ... no wait , make that two times ... in short : do n't waste time watching this movie , it 's not worth it
this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead . he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by . his brother then infects the other gang members.in some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense . the acting is mediocre but the story does n't help the film . the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies . the budget for this film i 'm sure was very limited . i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget . if you wa n't to see a good zombie flick do n't see this one .
jane eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it . i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about . this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book . the whole 'red room ' is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in . in the book the 'red room ' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of jane 's life . helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i 'm sure she was happy to die and leave early . in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head . the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie . do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it .
cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching . this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico . the makeup was half ass-ed to say the least , hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist . this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials , that in it self makes for a lousy show . perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance , instead the pilot lacked a good story line . i give this show a 1 out of 10 , i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option . i pray for a quick death to this show , i 'd give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death .
i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen . slow , badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing ! mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless . they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea . the plot is dull ! ! i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one ! ! if you avoid one film this year .... let it be
flat , soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film . absolutely nothing takes you by surprise , you can even tell when the bryan adams vocals are going to come in , which are always at the wrong time . the main character , spirit the horse , is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening . the narration is not needed , though , as everything happening is really obvious . you can even tell what the horses are saying , although all they do is neigh . which would be good , but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning , one for sorrow , one for laughing , etc . there is no variation between the horses ' voices . young kids might like this film , though . it 's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch , and there 's little danger of anyone being frightened . if you have nothing else to do , and want to watch a film with your kids , this is n't a bad choice . but otherwise , this is n't recommended .
spoiler alert ! ! ! personally i do n't understand why pete did not help to save williams life , i mean that would be great to know why william was motivated , or forced.i think secret service members are every day people , and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret service , now he 's motivations are clear , well known.but as a rental this film will not satisfy you , cause the old but used twists , the average acting -these are just things in this film , only for keep you wait the end.clark johnson as the director of s.w.a.t . did a far better work like this time , and i still wondering how the producers ( for example michael douglas ) left this film to theaters .
i began watching this movie with my girl-friend . and after 5 minutes i was alone . i succeed to stay until the end . it has been a painful experience . i liked jean hugues anglade , but i think that he needed to eat , as us , and thus he accepted to play in this movie . there are only 5 characters , and the rest could be called 'art ' or something that i could n't express , but that i did n't understand at all . the only worst movie i saw was crash , but i 'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again . good luck ! ! ; o )
there are two reasons why i did not give a 1 to this movie . one reason are some of the actors ( like malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh ) work , who tried to play at their usually good level of acting . however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting . the other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg , which is quite different to most other such roles i 've seen so far . everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be . boring scenes , useless and boring dialogs , bad script work . and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors . it could have been an interesting story though , but they failed completely .
film critics of the world , i apologize . it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on . but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt . however , my decision to see `` the cat in the hat '' was n't made haphazardly . you see , three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the `` calamity '' known as `` how the grinch stole christmas '' . then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . so when the critics unleashed their fury against `` the cat in the hat '' , another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role , i thought that it must be the same old song . how wrong i was . for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear . the opening credits are clever , the kids are charming and the production values are top notch . then the cat showed up . there are many problems from this point on , but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers . where `` the grinch '' was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey , `` the cat '' was destroyed by myers . he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong , comic sketches . every movie he 's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch , from `` wayne 's world '' to `` austin powers '' . so he tries to do the same thing here , it 's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl , not funny , just painful . not that the writers helped him out any . after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags , poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor . this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had . period . so much talent and work went into something so vile . i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess , i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies . if you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague . with movies like `` elf '' and `` brother bear '' currently in theaters , you have far better choices .
the movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the novel . if you want to see the movie then do n't read the novel first as it will shock you . however , cinematography was ok and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores africa then go for it . acting performances are adequate , however , many important events that were present in the novel are omitted . in the novel , sir henry curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father . gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king .
if you have n't seen this yet , i say just move on , take a walk in the park , do n't waste your time . neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money . * spoilers * - i ca n't decide which was worse : the movie itself or baldwin 's hairstyle ? ellen pompeo 's acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time . the storyline is just unbelievable . loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own ? ? infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks ? ? ? an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ? ? ? spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers ? ? ? give me a break . there 's only one good thing about this movie , though : at least , the production costs must be lower than `` ocean 's 12 '' 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one .
`` private practice '' is being spun off the fairly successful and well written `` grey 's anatomy '' . the cast is fabulous . the premise might even work . but the writing is just terrible . the pre-pilot disguised as a grey 's anatomy episode should have been my first warning . the plot was just blah . i thought maybe it was a fluke . so i set the dvr to tape the pilot and all other episodes . as i was watching the pilot , i just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot . the pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more . there 's supposed to be excitement , flash , great writing , intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season . amazingly , this show had none of that . thinking it was a fluke , i just watched the second episode hoping for the best . and although marginally better , it does n't come close to what it needs to be interesting ca n't miss tv . i just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch . not worth the effort imo , and i would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season . pass this one up folks .
alexandre aja 's remake of the hills have eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 . not only was it a remake of a classic horror film , but it was pretty damned good too . so , nearly a year later , we are being treated to the sequel to that remake . while original scripter wes craven is back as producer and co scripted , this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake . a group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film ( at least those that remain plus some new ones ) . there 's plenty of gore to be had here . what annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization . the viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we have n't gotten into them . even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time , nothing . gore for the sake of gore is pointless . there has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting . nothing that happens here is interesting . and what is it lately with rape scenes in films ? here we get yet another one for no real reason . hopefully this is one set of hills that wo n't be visited again .
unfortunately this film , 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of 'studio 54 . ' the only thing that was good about the picture was 'mike myers ' who was a joy to watch . 'neve cambpell , ' although her role was little was unfortunately bad . the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors , except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay .
how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me . the script is so banal , and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon . the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising , and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed . demi moore however , shows none a surprise by participating in this film , if one looks at her tracklist . all in all , a `` high concept '' style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of .
this is a film that makes you say 2 things ... 1 ) i can do much better than this ( acting , writing and directing ) 2 ) this is so bad i must leave a review and warn others ... looks as if it was shot with my flip video . i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me . i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video ; must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film . one of the worst 3 movies i have ever seen . hopefully the writers and director leave the business . not even talented enough to do commercials ! ! ! ! !
portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde ; she likes him too , but not for the reasons you might think . little-seen black comedy from writer pat proft features very good performances by joe alaskey and donna dixon , yet it makes no lasting impact . it 's just a quickie throwaway effort , helmed by norman bates himself , anthony perkins . even on the level of b-comedies , the somewhat-similar `` eating raoul '' is a better bet . there 's definitely an amusing set-up here ; unfortunately , the picture has nowhere to go in its second act . an interesting try , but it misfires . * * from * * * *
perhaps because i was so young , innocent and brainwashed when i saw it , this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me . i have n't seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school , so i am not sure what effect it would have on me now . however , i will say that it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends . it did serve its purpose , at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions . i was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast . i do n't want to spoil the movie for those who have n't seen it so i will not mention details of the scenes , but i can still picture them in my head ... and it 's been 19 years .
i am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur yasujiro ozu , whose masterfully understated views of japanese life , especially in the post-wwii era , illuminate universal truths . having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949 's `` late spring '' and 1953 's `` tokyo story '' , i am convinced that ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery . it is taiwanese director hou hsiao-hsien 's keen aspiration to pay homage to ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film . among with co-screenwriter t'ien-wen chu , hsiao-hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable . the story concerns yôko , a young japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century taiwanese composer jiang wen-ye in tokyo after coming back from taiwan where she taught japanese . after 25 drawn-out minutes of character set-up , she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in taiwan . at the same time , yôko 's coffeehouse friend hajime , who runs a used bookstore , has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her . hsiao-hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes . there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains . while these techniques are consistent with ozu 's style , hsiao-hsien can not seem to dive into the characters ' psyches the way ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics , in particular , yôko 's plight seems rather non-committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents ' reaction overly passive to hold much interest . in fact , the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it , which makes the film feel interminable . the performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable . j-pop music star yo hitoto brings a natural ease to yôko , while tadanobu asano is something of a cipher as hajime . the rest of the characters barely register , even nenji kobayashi and kimiko yo as yôko 's parents . cinematographer lee ping-bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots . hitoto speak-sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits , `` hito-shian '' . the dvd includes an hour long , french-made documentary , `` métro lumière '' , which actually does help provide some of the context for hsiao-hsien 's approach to the film . it includes excerpts from ozu 's films , in particular , `` equinox flower '' , to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either `` tokyo story '' or `` early summer '' , the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set-ups . there are also edited interview clips of hitoto , asano and hsiao-hsien , as well as the film 's trailer .
curiosity led me to this `` masterpiece '' . unfortunately , i did n't rent it , i bought it ! the most disturbing thing about this film is that it 's not so disturbing . for reasons known only to them , the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer . are you kidding me ? the man gave new meaning to the term `` finger lickin ' good '' ! and with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards i had trouble following the story . all in all jeremy renner 's performance was n't too bad . you can catch him in `` s.w.a.t . `` , in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop . anyway , i would rate this as a 1/10 . it only got a 1 because of renner 's so-so performance . there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer 's crimes . avoid this one .
i rented this movie for a few laughs . i had never seen the snl skit , but with hits like tommy boy , and waynes world , it could n't have been that bad , could it ? the answer : it was . this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work . i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part , but there was n't any . the highlight was tiffany amber thieson , and thats just about it .
very disappointing film . by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters . i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part , and william macy was good as always , still not worth watching . it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker . insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep .
it was everything this is n't : it had pace , pop , and actors who were n't afraid to chew the scenery . it also had a decent script . this one had me scratching my head . if farrah is n't really `` serious '' about a career , why does she have a manager ( and why is he wasting his time ) ? if kate and barney are `` artists , '' why do they sign up for the mother of all jiggle shows ( like the `` brady bunch '' movie where robert reed wants to do shakespeare , only to find himself on bb ) ? they were n't industry names , but they were n't exactly starving , either . and while they got the history right ( the poster was released before farrah got the show ) , silverman rejecting pitches for `` funniest home videos '' and `` american idol '' and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday he 'll create a show for her obviously did not happen . what bothered me was how spelling 's role is distorted . he 's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither . and how he `` comes up '' with the `` idea '' for ca was is laughable ! how were spelling and goldberg allowed to enforce farrah 's oral contract when the others were signed ? and why did n't farrah or bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her inner diva , but because majors wanted her to ? this is why , when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting farrah up as the `` bad girl '' ( like suzanne somers ) , it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the `` three 's company '' pic delivered .
they really ca n't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning . the problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president . trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular , but of course she comes out of all that . the girls go through drunken rages , exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense . it really ca n't get much worse than this awful film .
as a girl , hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo , leaving behind her two best friends , fumiya and sayori . she returns as a young woman , surprised to find that sayori died when she was a teenager . she reunites with fumiya and they are horrified to learn that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku . oh boy . i rented this because i like asian horror and i think chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress . unfortunately , if i had to describe shikoku in one word , it would be `` fruity . '' this movie is silly , boring , poorly filmed , unimaginative , and most of all , unscary . kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori , and her character is given little to work with .
`` cement '' is a bad movie about a bad cop ( penn ) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete . while we 're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it 's about , we 're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing . a boring junk flick overall , `` cement '' suffers from lack of a story , a clumsy execution , and that most ubiquitous of filmdom 's faults ; no reason to care . a time killer for the needy couch potato at best . ( d+ )
i didnt think it was possible , but i have found film worse than 'body melt ' . this film is really really bad ! and what makes it worse is that its another australian film ... shot on what looks like vhs , and with a terrible 80 's rock soundtrack , it just keep getting worse and worse , which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is ( skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone ? ) . and why do their accents keep changing ? from bad new york drawl , to prissy english , then pure aussie ! and it happens to the whole cast ! this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover ( i believe it was the utah film festival ) . this has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything ( perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell ) . come on guys ! this film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 ! ! ! it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there . well done to the `` film '' makers of this trash , for proving there is a reason not to see films ..... 0/10
`` you 're not going to shoot those little creatures . in the first place , they have n't done you any harm . in the second place , they may be radioactive . '' ah , the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that , superman and the mole-men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time . it 's beyond cheap ( the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation ) and pretty dull with it , though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute mole-men , diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters , released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious , merely misunderstood , and george reeves ' man of steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by jeff corey from killing them . an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day , perhaps , but with little more than good intentions to recommend it .
i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film . the only reason why i did n't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda . the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing . the problem is with the rest of the picture . alice faye comes off quite hollow . don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material , he comes off so terribly corny . the plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to faye . it seems that by playing the song and dance man , ameche 's marriage gets a second change to reignite . some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts . s.z . sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine . ditto for j. carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role . this is a chica chica boom bomb of a film .
so what 's the big fuss out of making an indiana jones wannabe when you have an actor who 's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who does n't want to go out on an adventure ? ? ? whoever wrote the script for jake speed was probably fired , but for whatever reasons possible , this movie greatly lacks in excitement ! that does n't mean it has no action , but look on the dark side of the picture . this has got to bare no resemblance to indiana jones or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes , and jake speed was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it ! besides , i 've never heard of the guy , so who needs his attention ?
one of the those `` coming of age '' films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids . this movie has neither . it is a poor excuse to let sylvia kristel 's body double frolic with a dorky eric brown . to make matters worse , the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny , sexy , or dramatic . laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard . ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for emmanuelle needs a body double . as the movie went on and on , i started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and little miss millions that had sylvia kristel seduce jennifer love hewitt as howard hesseman makes us nostalgic for wkrp . watch this to laugh at other people 's stupidity , or for ed begley jr. 's committed performance , or to wonder what sylvia kristel would look like with jennifer love hewitt . but i can give you an idea of your lesson , stay away from movies staring sylvia kristel that are not emmanuelle .
this is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture are n't enough to make a good film . sure , the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of los angeles in the thirties -- i especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel , and the tram rising up the hillside -- but in a sense this fine cinematography is self-defeating , because it creates a mood that `` something 's going to happen '' -- and nothing does . the script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma -- and time after time not delivering . not even delivering the ( i assume ) theme of the movie , the characters ' essential misfit . the lead actors , both too pretty for their roles , did n't convey any repression or agony , and the script did n't expose us to any . now , donald sutherland ? that 's another story . his character was so well fashioned , so perfectly played , that i wanted the camera to follow him .
this was shown as part of the 59th edinburgh international festival , though for reasons best left to the powers that be . a lot seems to have been made of the fact that it 's the first thai language film , made with thai actors & crew , but directed by a westerner . need n't have bothered to be honest , as this film is dull , dull , dull . why hint at something , why shroud an idea in mystery , why subtly invoke a feeling , when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs , obvious shots and over the top scenes > nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés . no hinting , no guessing , it 's all up on screen , no need to use our imaginations . wonder when the 'scary ' bit is coming ? no you wont , 'cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating , rising to a crescendo of ominously . hell , i 'm making up words to describe how bad this is . wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary ? why tax yourself - it 's really is a snake , and yes it 's really is biting his crotch , and there 's blood splattering everywhere . it 's a strange , uneasy film for several reasons . it 's supposed to be a horror film , but it 's not scary - the jolts are signposted & obvious . it might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of thailand , yet the director has a sleazy , lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens . maybe it was casting himself as the virginity-taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head . or maybe the whole thing was just pants . uninspired , insipid , repetitive , hackneyed - all candidates for best description , but dull seems most appropriate and honest . it 's all been seen before , probably better , often with more thought , rarely with less imagination or flare . sorry . thumbs down on every count . truly dire .
over christmas break , a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings . to make the work a bit more difficult , a murderous , chucks-wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm , preying on the group in various violent ways . registered as one of the 74 'video nasties ' listed by the u.k. in the 1980s , the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing . the term 'video nasty ' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore , violence , sex , etc . : all the things a horror fan dreams of . so , after hearing all of that info , i settled into pranks ( alt . title ) expecting a sleazy slasher experience . . . and that 's what it tried to be , but failed pretty much completely . visually , the film 's not great . the cinematography , gore ( except for a couple scenes ) , and overall direction all fail . it 's simply not enjoyable to watch . the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason ( like the opening kill ) . there are some cool death scenes , including a pretty nice face melt ( which can be seen on the poster ) , but that 's about it for the positive . the acting is pretty bad , the story seems unimportant , the killer is n't cool or scary , and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid : it 's a bit boring . overall , for a film done by a few ucla film students for $ 90,000 ( which would be over double that today ) , the dorm that dripped blood is n't a total mess . it has a couple good things , and is fairly watchable . . . but , as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces . . . it just can not compare . do n't expect much , and you may at least be entertained . i hate to say it , but this is one of the few films i 've seen that would actually be better with a remake . . . and yet , they go after great works like black christmas . oh well . . . obligatory horror elements : - subgenre : slasher - violence/gore : there are some brutally cool kills , and the gore is okay for the most part . . . but nothing special . also , they off-screened some of the best murders . - sex/nudity : there 's a little unappealing ( to me ) nudity , but not very much . - cool killer ( s ) : nah . the ending monologue ( s ) of the killer made him/her pretty uncool . - scares/suspense : a jump scare or two , but nothing too effective . - mystery : i suppose , yeah , but i simply did n't care enough , and it 's as obvious as the nose on the killer 's face . - - - final verdict : 3.75/10 . bah ! humbug ! -ap3-
this film is another of director tim burton 's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his ` vision ' to the screen . he has done it with ` batman ' , ` sleepy hollow ' and now this . this is not a remake . the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak ( and charleton heston makes a cameo ) . burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today 's mass viewership . the original planet of the apes was a product of its time . during the 1960 's america was struggling to redefine its civilization . it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . in that context , pota was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . the dialectic between colonel taylor ( charleton heston ) , dr. cornelius ( roddy mcdowall ) and dr. zira ( kim hunter ) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious . burton 's version is as much a product of today 's times as pota was of the sixties . this is apes for dummies . it is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . the ` surprise ' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , burton 's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , ` i know something you do n't know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out . ' from a technical perspective , as is always the case with burton 's film , the film is excellent . the makeup is fantastic and burton 's camerawork is outstanding ( though i continue to dislike his dark look ) . however , thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script . the story has been reduced to a monster movie . the humans band together behind captain davidson ( mark wahlberg ) to fight the monstrous apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats ( notably helena bonham carter as ari ) . the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today 's fast food mentality . the acting is mixed . mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . this part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in wahlberg 's repertoire . helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager . then there is tim roth . his is a virtuoso performance , single-handedly saving the film from total ruin . roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade . he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time . additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists . this film is a great disappointment . it is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . i rated it a 3/10 . from a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 9/10 . however the story is an insult to the original franchise . it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . of course it 's true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .
i just saw this movie last night and , being someone who had very low expectations to begin with , was still disappointed . the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point ( the guy being awake during the surgery ) , had nothing to do with the outcome . it would have ended the same way regardless . so , what was the point of this ? who knows . also , this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he did n't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table ? give me a break . jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad . the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish . i 'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel , you would be in more pain than that .
this movie , supposedly a thriller , had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end , but it ended up more as a yawn . the writing was trite , the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring . george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym , matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter . the worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business , oil and the middle-east . i have seen documentaries provide more excitement . watch it only if there 's absolutely nothing else to do .
i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; `` rated r for strong violence and sexuality , nudity and language '' . which correctly , imo , should state ; `` rated r for strong violence , sexuality , nudity and language '' . the word `` sexuality '' should come after a `` comma '' , not an `` and '' because of the huge difference in meaning it make . i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non-existent . my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like `` vivid '' movie . that is why i felt cheated . story-wise , it was so-so , after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it . i know i do n't . of course , this is only my opinion . joseph
man , this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books . frankly , i found it too slow and unappealing right from the start . i kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened . this movie is vastly overrated . shakespeare , with the king james english , has never appealed to me , anyway , so it may just be me . there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello . the good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young , slim and attractive shelly winters . overall , this is simply too boring , too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again . besides , we all know that most actors are nut-cases , anyway , but kudos to hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story .
what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless . movie . a remake that did not need to be retold . everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments . worst movie i ever saw . save your time and money ! ! ! nicgolas cage was biking down hills , swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene . although a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself . it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies . do n't they get a copy of the script first . if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd .
what is this crap ? my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title ... i decided to watch it with her so she did n't get bored , and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality . first , the acting was terrible . they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards . the delivery is sub-par and very formulaic . scene cuts were terrible .. it looks like they took it straight from the story board , if there was one . secondly , the jokes and stereotypes were n't original or well played at all- again , very formulaic . i ca n't count the times i was able to predict the next joke . i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly `` subtle '' sexual innuendos . the cat , the beaver patch , hung wong ? .. c'mon ! just .. stay away from this movie . it 's not cute , it 's not funny , it 's not even stupid-funny . it 's just stupid-stupid . it 's like a pg kids ' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo , vulgarity , and violence to bump the mpaa rating . stay away . `` would you like to ride my yacht ? '' `` is that what they 're calling it now ? '' `` you could ride my ding . '' `` oh ! i think i got blood on my stool ! '' badly played , sir .
tasteless . i ca n't even write intelligently about the movie . i laughed the entire movie . it was n't supposed to be funny . matt farnsworth has no clue what he is doing . his story is written , it seems , without any knowledge of iowa culture and the meth problem . i know farnsworth is from iowa , which makes his movie even more puzzling to me . why do the two main characters have accents ? it does n't make any sense . the acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch . gratituous violence and sex filled the movie . i am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy , but it came across as unbelievable and offensive . the ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all i could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief . as i walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me . the ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears , but it did the exact opposite . do not waste your time on this horrible movie , unless you want to see ignorant , sappy , overacted , clichéd drivel .
a noble effort , i guess , but ultimately a poor one . before seeing this film , i felt `` bartleby , the scrivener '' was unfilmable . after seeing it , i still do . unfortunately , i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on , and they will be upset at the film 's needless revisions ( updating from 1850 to 1970 , moving from new york to london ) . even the superb talents of paul scofield ca n't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville 's metaphysical classic .
s.i.c.k . really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself . there was absolutely no acting to speak of . the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.the budgeting of this movie was sufficient . the filming was sub sesame street . the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits . the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store . the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh . if there is a book out there for this movie i 'm sure it 's better . i would avoid this at all costs . i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it . just kidding .
i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're-enactment ' , but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h. bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there 's a reasonably good supporting cast . i enjoyed it .
alicianne ( laurel barnett ) becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon ( rosalione cole ) who has recently lost her mother . but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave ( conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house ) late at night ... where she also meets her `` friends '' ... this starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery ... then falls apart . the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long . the acting is terrible across the board ( with cole easily being the worst ) . badly directed with some of the worst editing i 've ever seen in a motion picture . scenes ( and sound ) are just cut off with no rhyme or reason . also the film has terrible ( and obvious ) post-production sound . as for blood and violence -- forget it ! there 's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake . i 've never seen such fake-looking blood -- looks like ketchup ! boring , pointless -- a rightfully forgotten drive-in movie . you can skip this one .
priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be 'comedy ' . that is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for . after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama , hera pheri and hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i ca n't recollect for now . now with hideous films like dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture ' . dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy . the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent . speaking of the acting , i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top ( if you compare them with the others in the movie ) , then came tusshar kapoor , then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above . the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting . the grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly . the plot was the same , seen before one . four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists . there is a 'bad ' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb . and at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine . the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty . the worst thing about the movie is its length . after an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater . but being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie . the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place . if your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun . 3 out of 10 .
jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis . i did n't find this particular episode that funny : the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame ( jerry is essentially the 'bad guy ' in this one , tormenting poor tom for no particular reason ) . there is the occasional flash of inspiration ( such as tom 's literal 'heart in mouth ' experience , and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body ) , but , on the whole , this effort lacks the frenetic pacing , excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t & j 's other cartoons .
my score for this crap : 1 / 10 1 for the technical only . everything else is very bad . another film that makes no sense . clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission . while it 's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth , they are among the biggest liars on the planet , it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic . we must believe that taking people for morons . perhaps it was reason to believe , since 99 % of the films are crap . because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios . when you look at the price we give oscars , we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others . and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense . but it was not for education and health . if you still want to listen to this s * * t , press super fast forward button ( at least 20x ) .
if john waters had written and directed `` house of 1000 corpses '' after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object , the result would probably be something like `` the blood shed . '' it 's mildly entertaining for the first half hour , but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives , cutlery and pliers . susan adriensen ( sno cakes ) is incredibly annoying and terry west ( elvis bullion ) is almost as bad in whatever it is he 's doing in front of the camera . maybe the best thing about `` the blood shed '' is that it wo n't take most viewers very long to forget about it .
hey arnold ! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie . the plot is not very creative . the paul sorvino character ( shenk ) is buying all of the decrepit , low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall , shopping complex and office buildings . this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies . it is boring . paul sorvino is not very exciting either , so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary . gramps remembers something about a historical document , and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga , whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk 's mall . the kids must move around town on buses , and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly , but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids . hey arnold , the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining , and it has enough humor to appeal to adults . the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie . hey arnold the movie , is about five times more sedated , and a good way to put anyone , including kiddies to sleep . hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending . if you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie , this is it . i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie , the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes . this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon . hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel .
i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television . but the version put to dvd was a disaster . the lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised . in one instance adele is being put to bed , and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in in mid-sentence - where it 's the next night . characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced , leaving one to wonder if they 'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie . the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyp . be careful which version of this movie you buy ! we 're sending this one back .
a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend . suddenly , she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack . the name of the female assassin is sawa . she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal , akai , who is sleeping with her . one day sawa finds out he killed her parents .. -- -- -- - even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest . `` kite '' has style , but it is still trash . the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time , only causing the story to fall flat on it 's face . one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good/bad heroine sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building , yet the dramatic structure is n't nearly as good orchestrated and the director yasoumi umetsu 's weird and grotesque animation of the character 's faces is awful . not only that , the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy . grade : 3/10
since its release in 1983 , `` a christmas story '' , the jean shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego , ralphie , has become a true classic . `` my summer story '' , however , still has shepherd as the narrator , but it has absolutely none of the charm , and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film . `` my summer story '' is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories , which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops . charles grodin , who i normally like , is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father ( more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original ) , and his character never seems anything but forced . kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie , and the little brother is all but forgotten here . only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that 's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on `` free dish night '' . the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin . may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to `` a christmas story '' , it 's a very poor one and not worth most people 's time . 2 out of 10 .
i 'm not a big fan of rom/coms at the best of times . a few have been quite good ( check of dream for an insomniac ) , but this one is just more of the same but less . with a running time of 100min , i expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins . the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out lee 's character . all i can say is avoid . i gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $ $ 3 of out 10 ( and only cos i 'm a big lee fan )
did anyone else feel as betrayed as i did ? the first hour or so was pretty solid but the last . oh my god . it seemed like it was predictable and cheesy . not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been . most reviews have read have been glowing but i really ca n't understand why . i had seriously predicted that general ending way earlier on but then retracted it because i thought `` no , they would never do that , that 's far too lame . '' i can hardly stand it . i feel so unsatisfied . i think i 'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season i own . someone please . change my mind . i want to love this . so bad . someone tell me why i 'm wrong . great show . terrible ending .
tyrannosaurus azteca is set during the sixteenth century where famous spanish explorer hernando cortes ( ian ziering ) has landed in mexico with six of his best men including lieutenant rios ( marco sanchez ) , they intend to claim the land in the name of the spanish & maybe steal some gold too if the opportunity arises . within minutes they have their first sight of local aztec savages , within minutes after that cortes & his men are captured & held prisoner . if that was n't bad enough it turns out that a couple of tyrannosaurus rex live there & like to eat the locals , in an effort to win their lives the spanish offer to help the locals get rid of their monster problem but with various hidden agendas & ulterior motives it 's not just the dinosaurs they have to watch out for ... directed by brian trenchard-smith ( who , coincidently , made one of my all time favourite exploitations films turkey shoot ( 1982 ) which i throughly recommend to one & all ) & also more commonly known under the spoof sounding title of aztec rex ( the title was changed by the sci-fi channel when they aired it maybe as the original title tyrannosaurus azteca sounds like it might be a foreign film ) this is yet another idiotic & cheap looking sci-fi channel 'creature feature ' & that 's all you need to know really . based on & around the real spanish conquistador cortes during his expedition to mexico the film definitely does n't strive for historic accuracy although i will admit that the story tries to do something slightly different here but ultimately tyrannosaurus azteca is still just a 'creature feature ' with a bunch of people running from some poor cgi computer graphic of a monster despite it 's period setting . not too sure what else i can say , despite being set centuries ago the usual clichés are here , the character 's are the usual cardboard cutouts , make stupid decisions & the selfish one , the heroic one , the backstabbing one , the faceless victim who exists just to get eaten & the pretty woman are all here & easy to spot . the film is predictable , silly , dull & does n't really entertain on any level although it does move along at a decent pace & there 's one or two half decent moments of gore if that sort of thing interests you . the story is n't that good & has plenty of holes too , this is also the sort of film that you will have completely forgotten about within a few days . now i have seen & commented on plenty of sci-fi channel 'creature features ' & usually the cgi computer effects are terrible & while tyrannosaurus azteca does n't exactly buck the trend i will admit there are a few effects shots which look alright but then they are usually ruined by an absolutely awful effects shot straight afterwards . there 's a few decent gore effects here too , there 's a cut out heart , a guy 's leg is bitten off , there 's some blood splatter , a cool shot of a guy left holding his own intestines after he has been attacked by the dinosaur , there 's a few dead bodies seen & someone is stabbed with a spear . the t-rex gets to eat a couple of people too . the production values are really cheap , the aztec set looks like one of those theme park attractions made from styrofoam & those spanish men must have been imprisoned in the worst enclosure in cinematic history with the fence supposedly keeping them in lower than a mans waist , they could have simply stepped out of it & run away it was so low . with a supposed budget of about $ 900,000 i ca n't see where the money went , shot in o'ahu in hawaii in apparently fifteen days . the acting is n't great from no-one i have ever heard of . tyrannosaurus azteca really is n't any better than any other cheap sci-fi channel 'creature feature ' despite an almost interesting & unusual premise , that basic statement should basically be enough for you to decide whether you will enjoy this or not ( at a guess probably not ) .
this show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious dvr hard drive space . i did n't expect much and i actually received less . not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode , i can not believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again . i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughter 's hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse . i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the '07 fall schedual , perhaps a hospital/crime/mocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck ? in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good .
as an engineer , i must say this show 's first season started out very promising . most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible , and the relationships portrayed between the eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge . but after the first season , the show started degrading , heavily . most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real . the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode , but in the end , this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show . if you are gon na watch it , go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . thereafter i would not waste my time . myself , i gave the show up midway through season 3 . season 1 - 8 stars season 2 - 5 stars season 3 - 3 stars let 's sum that up to 4 stars . since charlie does n't know his math anymore , i wo n't bother with the correctness of mine either .
the last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks . like the vagabond , the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly . mona , the lazy , sullen , and drug-addicted title character , is not likable and bonnaire does little to make her interesting . although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle , her motivations are never really clear . the episodic nature of the film , involving some random characters , becomes tiresome after a while , making it seem much longer than its running time . it is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not draw more attention from men .
i 've seen many horror shows over the years , like nightstalker , that dealt with the wendigo legend , so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season . man was i mistaken . the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy , but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property . ve-ery scary - not ! this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor , another total loser . it 's getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies , since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore . what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made ? go back to the drawing board fellas , and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around .
i am usually disappointed by network movies . even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people . however , this one is the worst of the worst . the screenplay is weak and the acting , especially that of tracey pollan is abominable . i 've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting . pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks . when she tries to express fear , anger or grief , it 's extremely hollow . because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously . if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment . scary things wo n't scare you , sad things wo n't make you sad , romance wo n't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive . `` first to die '' says a lot about this movie .
after watching this thing , then reading the summary on the back of the dvd , then thinking back to actual movie .... i became a bit dizzy . i thought , maybe i fell asleep and dreamed i was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism . where ( zombies ? ) come out of nowhere and ( vampires ? ) who ( seduce ? ) pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world . neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other . the only fighting i remember was getting that walrus bonny giroux 's panties off . coo coo ca fat ! all of them ! maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution , but that actually made it more entertaining ... in conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity , plot , character development , antagonism , subject matter , and acting then the entirety of this film . it made bloodrayne look like citizen f * * * ing kane
featured in 1955 's the cobweb is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran lillian gish to actors studio progeny susan strasberg . set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital , what is this movie about you wonder ...... high drama ? doctor & patient relationships ? shock therapy treatment ? no , this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! you think i 'm kidding ? you wo n't believe your eyes as you 're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! progressive head shrink dr. mciver ( richard widmark ) wants to have all of the hospital 's patients involved in the design , selection and execution of the needed new draperies . mciver 's wife played by marble mouthed gloria graham wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too . so does long time staffer miss inch ( lillian gish ) . directed by vincent minelli , you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart judy garland . talented actors like lauren bacall , susan strasberg , charles boyer , and john kerr are wasted in this hokey story . what were they thinking ?
having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions . yet , it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it . davy crockett was very poorly represented by billy bob , who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam houston given both men 's love of oratory . i think self-absorbed dennis quaid ( an actual texan ) would have been a perfect crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship . as a texan and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel davy crockett was the quintessential texan even though not born here . our unofficial motto is `` it ai n't braggin ' if it is a fact '' was made for crockett . and that last scene at the alamo where crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to davy crockett ever made . to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous . three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat . finally , that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 texicans vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained mexican regulars . every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during siesta time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand .
this movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the dvd from the movie store . this movie made me sick not because it was gory , but because i wasted 2 50 on it ! ! ! ! it looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it ! i am so ticked off , even the btk killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or bubble gum omg i cant even get all the words out to explain it do not watch this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! !
9 , the film i 've been looking forward to for months .... was little more then a disappointment . i was deeply surprised by 9 's lack of story and strange character development . all the awesome action sequences in the world do n't make up for a single unsympathetic character . the strange , almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place , they were infuriating . the story is about robots and scientists ... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices ? ? how , what , when , why .... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater . a film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth .... i would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good . but the filmmakers have relied on cgi wizardry and tim burtons name to draw in the crowd . which ... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect . 9 could have been awesome ... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators .
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children 's comic ! i gave it 2 out of 10 for it 's attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was good . this was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies . no interviews with surviving cast members , crew members , production team members etc. , or their friends , families , and any biographers of those people . in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the ( supposedly ) biographical book . as for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and was n't common knowledge well that never happened .
on the face of it , this should be a great film , a great cast , a plot with many possibilities and one of hollywood 's finest behind the camera for the first time . however , its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again . this movie fails on so many levels . in a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations , it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director . not so here , the great cast is horribly under-used , none more so than the great , late john spencer , the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you have n't seen in a hundred other tv movies . there is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists . at least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
`` national lampoon goes to the movies '' ( 1981 ) is absolutely the worst movie ever made , surpassing even the witless `` plan 9 from outer space . '' the lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes , each featuring different performers . the only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities . well , maybe there is one . another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice , and he 's right . misses ganzel and dusenberry flash their assets prettily , in part one and part two , respectively . but their glamorous displays are , alas , wasted . the directors seem to have forgotten that even t & a needs a credible story to surround it , and there 's none in sight . the third segment , starring robby benson and richard widmark , is the most disgusting of the three , and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film . benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman , brightly reporting for his first day of duty , ready to rid the streets of evil . he is paired with an old , cynical cop played by widmark , and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together , we sense a possible redemption of the film 's earlier failures . maybe , just maybe , the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner 's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty . maybe all will end happily after all . but alas , this movie heads straight for the toilet , with no redemption , no happy ending , no coherent story of any kind . before `` national lampoon goes to the movies , '' i thought i had already seen the worst schlock that hollywood could possibly turn out . unfortunately , i had n't seen the half of it .
* may contain spoilers * a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie . which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before . review the same movie again . do n't get me wrong , i still do n't like the movie , i still think it 's dreck , and i still think the zombies do n't look all that zombie-ish . the story in the movie is still in my opinion , weak and rather lame . the story is about a guy named rick , who works as a scientist ( that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells , in animals ) and his brother germaine , the two are n't exactly on the best of terms ( my my , an original plot point ) and argue a lot . one day germaine is shot in a drive-by shooting , and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germaine ( whereas most people would 've called 911 , but whatever ) , naturally the serum fails and germaine `` dies '' ( if that did n't happen there 'd have been no movie ) , after the police and the coroner ( until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics should 've shown up ) leave the scene shows the coroner van ( which i still believe was just someone 's van with a `` coroner '' decal thrown on the side ) , and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics . i would talk more about the plot , but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you would n't want to watch it ( and we would n't want that now would we ? ) , but suffice to say that the story ( in my opinion at least ) meanders and is rather slow moving ( pun not intended ) . as i 've previously said in my review the zombies do n't look all that much like zombies , i still think they look like they 've been in a bar fight . that 's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot , but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims . also i still do n't like the fact that the director ( s ) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move . they could n't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble ( as most zombie movies do ) , do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people . in one scene the zombie runs toward the living , and in the other he just shambles to them . and sometimes they just do n't seem believable ( yes i know their fictitious creatures but still ) , i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room , and i still do n't like the zombie who is lying on the ground , gets shot , then jerks like he was just shot . the sound in the movie also bothered me , mainly the music , which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non-existent . music in a movie is important folks . especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick . the acting is still atrocious ( in my opinion ) and is on par with the american `` actors '' from the japanese zombie movie junk . the movie is still bad , almost house of the dead bad , it 's better , no doubt about that , but then again that 's not saying much . it 's not the worst movie out there , and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day was n't good . i also think the movie moves really really slow , despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes ( and yes , i still do n't like the opening song ) . this is the type of movie i think is well-suited to be premiered on the sci-fi network . which is why i am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten . but think of it this way , at least it 's not a negative one .
this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . well there 's nothing wrong with that , except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age . it 's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves . the movie has no plot . it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath . there are some funny scenes and comedic bits . but they do n't redeem the flat monotony . the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do , and not done very well at that . anything that ca n't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation . i went to see this film after seeing the trailer , which makes it look like a tarrentino piece . well , the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get . ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane , inane comedy . it works at times , but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over . it 's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie . it 's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy . i can see where the story idea is intriguing . but , in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england . in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era . he plans to make a part 2 . i guess he thinks he 's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing . at the opening in la , wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 . he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one , to which he replied , well yea , sure .
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel . deathstalker , the throne of fire , barbarian queen , conquest , the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor . the primitive costumes , dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film , but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters . compare this film to beowulf ( 1999 ) . it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters .
not a very good movie but according to the info it 's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques . the purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the nk pow camps and that 's done effectively enough , with surprising frankness for the time . whatever technical flaws exist ( and there are plenty ) by watching this you 'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again , nasty because it 's being done north of the dmz and not in guantanamo bay . i do n't think any of the korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office , and if you watch the movies like this one and pork chop hill in comparison to the vietnam films . i do n't know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the wwii concepts ( the boys tend to wisecrack a lot ) or the war or what , but it 's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making movies like `` go tell the spartans '' .
i do n't get this . the movie obviously has a pretty good budget . it has very good cinematography . it has nice pacing , good editing and pretty good directing too . then why oh why did n't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such lousy actors that ca n't act their way out of a paper bag ? this movie could have been good . at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end , you realize that the movie was no good at all . so i would say it 's a good production but a bad movie . too bad actually . and eels ? come one , really !
contrary to its title , this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish . all humor appears forced , theatrical , mechanical , staged , reminiscent of those pakistani plays available on video , including even the mannerisms . everybody is screaming , shouting and doing odd things for no reason . the premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from hollywood 's 'boeing boeing '' . john abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here . if we keep morality factor aside , even then the bizarre events looks trite . akshay kumar and paresh rawal , two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain . at least , the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless , buxomed bimbettes ( 3bs ) who talk , behave and even scream in quite similar fashion . the major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other ? just to do some sex , what else ? the same could be done in hundreds of other ways . therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily . but surely , great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial . now for those who call it a situational comedy , i call it a pathetic taste . sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic , weird and maddening type of humor , where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things ?
holy crap ! what a terrible , terrible spanish thriller ! i 've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night . i watched an hour or so before heading to bed . i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing . i finished it last night and could n't believe where i stopped it the night before . literally , i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill . like i said , i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar . i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a `` menacing '' game of laser tag . whew ! then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds . whew ! you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil ( co-writer of amenabar 's two big previous hits ) . there is an excellent score and great photography . but this scenario reeks of silliness . how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me .
i love science fiction , i am fascinated by egyptian mythology and i appreciate digital animation . i figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable . i could not have been more wrong : the story ( or actually the lack there of ) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story . the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie . especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance ' . bad acting would n't have been such a huge problem if only 'director ' bilal did n't take himself so seriously ; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic , it looks like bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here . well , there 's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk , only pretentiousness ! this man should really stick to making comics , since he fails on all possible accounts as a director . worst of all is the terrible digital animation , which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience . the graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in 'van helsing ' look like live actors ! and since half the characters are cgi-animated , it is quite a problem that the cgi-effects look so fake . if the egyptian gods actually exist then bilal 's a dead guy , since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie .
do n't see this . this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen . its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there . what a sad view of mormon life . i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward . if it was i do n't think i would have made it through it . its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do . the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through . i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie . or are there c movies ? anyway ... i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese . i wish some mormons would start making some quality movies .
`` grey matter '' aka `` the brain machine '' but the video people thought better of that ; the screen says 1972 but imdb says 1977 ; it 's that kind of movie . the government has some kind of overriding interest in this 'brain machine ' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be , roughly , a philosopher , a horny priest , a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts . in the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies . here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way ; my s * * * has better production values than this . it held my interest , though , just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing , dabbling in four-guys-in-a-room character drama . the answer : a tract about how science is inferior to god . thanks a lot . it 's like opening a kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle . the priest is played by james `` roscoe p. coltrane '' best , the philosopher by gerald `` the republican simon '' mcraney . also featuring very , very , very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity , this moves almost as slow as the liberal convention .
being a slasher film aficionado , i typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas , which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain , i will say . while channel surfing the other night , sleepaway camp ii happened to cross paths with me . of course , i wanted to check it out , as i had heard of the sleepaway camp franchise , but have never actually seen any of them ( for shame , i know ) . i will note that since i have not seen the original , my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously , because perhaps what i think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise 's own design . now i 'm assuming that the franchise of sleepaway camp is , in itself , a joke on itself . hell , even the name comes off as an intentional joke . sleep away camp ? it 's good fun . i can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value , but that 's about as far as i can go . the acting in this movie made the cast of the original friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of macbeth . campy requires bad acting , but come on . pamela springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast . as far as comedy goes , there were a few times where i chuckled , but it was few and far between . ultimately , sac ii is pretty boring , and i really did want to sleep away the camp . the deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them . if you 're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp , i recommend club dread . if your channel surfing takes you across this one , check and see what else is on .
i wanted to punch the tv . watching it was torture . i hated it . never watch this movie . the terrorists are annoying . adam sandler is annoying . i normally like him but not in this one . i wanted to break the dvd . this is the most irritating film in the world . the comedian he 's jealous of is obnoxious . the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls . it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv . do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone . if you even like adam sandler a little bit , do n't buy it . it will just make you hate him . do yourself a favor , if you see it in the store , hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it . its a waste of the $ 1.99 i paid for it .
this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for fellini . about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon . this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence , opulence and sexual challenge . sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover 's autobiography fail to engage the viewer . the art direction and costume design are however outstanding . the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter . also nominated ( oddly ) was the disjointed , pointless and almost inacessible screenplay . go figure ! ! the film on video is only 150 minutes , 16 minutes short of the original running time . this viewer was grateful .
this film , by oscar petersson , is unique . its uniqueness does n't lie in the story , since many a half brained hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots , but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects . the dialog is worse than embarrassing . rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix . bosnians speaking english with heavy swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor . uninspired lightning and camera-work are icing on the turkey film cake . as a sort of surprise for the audience , there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you 'd least expect any . to add insult to injury , the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing . the `` bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy 's speech '' scene in the church , is the point at which is time to dethrone ed wood from the position as the worst director of all times ; move over ed wood - here comes oscar petersson !
how can you take her hard-living , glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with * that * accent ? it 's absurd . apart from that , the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky , the plot is a shallow , boring , confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing . the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused . the film ever shows you things that do n't really happen and then later says `` that did n't really happen , this happened '' - see the ( apparent ) killing of the ( fake ) 'first ladies ' . what have we seen the first , wrong , sequence of events for then ? terrible choice in casting , a convoluted , messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style . 1/5 .
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television . i remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man-eating ants . what i did n't remember was how awful it was ! ! ! i recently caught this movie on television late at night . i 'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again ! suzanne somers ( at the pinnacle of her career playing chrissy on 'three 's company ' ) plays a vacationer at lakewood manor . constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants ' nest . or should i say , a * man-eating ants ' nest * ! ! one of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants . one minute he 's picking them off his clothes one by one , the next minute he 's covered in them . the next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt . if you thought that was pretty far-fetched , you should see myrna loy playing a wheel-chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the manor via helicopter ! i could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie ! the final scenes depict suzanne , robert foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other , blowing through straws and covered in ants . that 's basically the movie . there 's really no `` disaster '' appeal or `` big-star '' draw to the film . it was intended to be a 'grand-scale ' television event at the time . now , it 's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station . if you want to catch suzanne somers at her best , then watch an episode of three 's company . if you want to see myrna loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills , then watch this movie . 0/10
my friend 's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out , so when she brought home the convent , a horror movie , i could n't wait to watch it . given that it 's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious , i can say that in some weird way , i like this movie . yes , the acting is bad , and yes , it 's the cheapest movie i 've ever seen , but it 's so damn funny ! `` what , are you smoking ca-rack ? ! '' i did n't know this movie even was ever released ... i figured it was too bad ... yeah , so ... overall the movie is pretty bad ( you got ta admit that much at least ) but i promise you , you will get a good laugh out of it . * this movie kinda sucks but it 's good for a laugh ... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair ' .. the dagger of despaaaaaair !
i am a fan of the nightmare series but this one is horrible . the deaths are so trendy . if you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated . i did like the flashbacks . i think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive . that would have been more interesting . this is a movie you can take or leave . depends on how much spare time you have .
i watched this on the tube last night . the actor 's involved first caught my attention . the first scenes were attention getters . some funny some sad . good character development . i felt that the latter third of the film diverged . if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching . i kept watching wanting to how how it tied together . unfortunately i feel that it never happened . i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish ( ? ) . was that the other shoe ? would i recommend ? no , i think not . as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated ( 60 's jive ) but it was not too distracting . the ending totally turned me off .
i ca n't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton , and sure it 's his company . but `` you 're fired '' or `` you 're hired '' , for how many seasons now ? after watching the show i would n't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve . i 'd love to hear just one person get up and say `` donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo '' . i see he 's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe . i hope he gets hurt so i do n't have to see his pathetic face anymore . it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it . i 'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it does n't deserve that .
most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up . no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag . falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this .
i 'm not sure if the filmmakers were after a saw-type movie or 12 angry men ( people piecing together the facts to get at the truth ) . whatever it was , it was poorly done and not worth watching . i do n't watch movies for blood and gore , but because this film had little else going for it , it should have shown the actual killing more . most were off-camera , minimizing the horror that we were supposed to feel by the deaths . it also bugged me that the cop was among the victims ; he unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man going to prison by accepting planted evidence ( given to him by mjh ) into the evidence room . ( and would n't mjh a the prosecuting attorney , have had access to that evidence -- taking it out and putting the wrong evidence back -- anyway , so she would n't have needed the cop 's help ? ) . the others , while often also not realizing it was this particular person they were harming , still played larger roles in his ultimate demise . the gun dealer should have know his guns would be used for evil intent . the insurance guy rejected a person obviously in need , etc . but the cop 's crime seemed minor in comparison since he did n't know exactly what he was doing . the filmmakers could have taken it a step further and had him be the one that encouraged mjh to plant the evidence , which would have made him more culpable . and mjh 's yelling that he ( the cop ) got her in that mess does n't make any sense at all . it would been more intriguing if each person died in a way that offered the others a clue to why he/she was there and deserved to die . the insurance guy , for example , could have had the applications he rejected rammed down his throat so he choked on them ; the oriental woman could have had her eyes gouged out because she was a false witness , etc . yes , more violent that the gun deaths , but more interesting . the dialog was n't witty , there were no twists , and the ending was one of the worse ( if not the worst ) i 've ever seen . the ending along knocked three stars off my rating . the actors did a decent job , especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with . overall , a waste of time .
one thing that astonished me about this film ( and not in a good way ) was that nathan stoltzfus , who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse , was one of the historians working on this film , considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded . another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels , but in that case , why did she give every impression that that was what had happened ? why not show other possible reasons for the mens ' release , such as the disaster that was stalingrad , or the nazis ' fear that the international press , based in berlin , would find out about the protest . also , why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again ? surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history ! in places , it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common . overall , this film failed in its aim , which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance , which is a shame , because done better , it could have had a major impact .
i rented this movie last week . i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it , so it seemed promising . and it was , until justin timberlake came on scene . he is a really bad actor and should n't be allowed to make a movie ever again . i mean , he is one of the most boring , uninspired actors i 've ever seen . he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . why the hell was he cast for the role of josh pollack ? i think matt damon would have been a better choice . kevin spacey was another big disappointment . his character is so dull , it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en . it might sound cool , but believe me , it 's not . now , dylan mcdermott 's acting is very good . it 's about one of the very few good things about this movie . he is just inspired . morgan freeman is good but nothing special . he has some really cool lines though . about the story , although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . i was expecting a big twist when lazerov ( dylan mcdermott ) was killed , but nothing really happened .
what else is left to say ? i 've read all the reviews here and most are right on . . however , one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it ( or something along those lines ) . evil ? ! wow , what a shocker . . i mean , tbn basically made this film . open your eyes please . anway , this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years . the most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it . if this movie can be made , there are no limits , and therefore , we have no choice but to get ready for `` yentl 2 '' , and `` ernest loses the omega codes . '' for those of you who are into the biblical stories , the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started .
some films are so bad that they 're good . this is clearly not one of them . based on a true story , this film was about as true to the story as pinocchio 's chances of becoming a real boy . the acting was terrible , the direction was poor , and it travelled way too fast . it was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home . nor did melissa joan hart ever strike me as a talented actress , but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway . like most of her other films , she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much , talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic . she really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she 's talking to a camera , when she should be engaging the viewer in her character . it pretty much lets down the whole film , and any leg that it may have had left to stand on , is ruined . probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end . but even that was n't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film . watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast .
simply awful slasher , molded from the i know what you did last summer type of fodder , has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a florida condo being murdered one by one . a misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences .. nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible . del tenney ( the curse of the living corpse ; i eat your skin ) , of all people , executive produced , co-wrote , and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer i guess means something to why he 's psychotic . the revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective , probably not surprising a soul who watches it . there are a lot of attempted jump scares , with one character popping out to frighten their friend , which could n't even manufacture a few cheap thrills , because they are so calculated in such a tepid way . most of the attacks occur off-screen with bleeding throat cuts ( .. or pools ) representing the only real display of violence . the protracted finale , where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible , is embarrassing and tense-less . there 's not one single positive to derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one-dimensional roles . and , for pity sake , they could 've at least allowed us to see joey lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes . dorie barton , as the heroine final girl , beth morgan , who the killer seems to be obsessed with , could n't be more vacuous and uninteresting ( .. oh , she was in rehab , and takes pills for her nightmares ; such intriguing exposition ) . chad allen , cast against type as a very intimidating `` friend '' of the group ( .. who happens to disappear from the film first , setting up the idea that he 's the first victim ) , has a tough hill to climb with his role , so steep he eventually stumbles , rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight . jeff conaway , needing some cash i guess , has the beleaguered fbi agent role , whose daughter 's murder motivates him to seek out the killer , leading him to florida . jack mcgee has his usual a $ $ hole role as a smart-mouth florida police chief who is often nose to nose with conaway 's agent . oh , the answer to the title 's question .. not really . because once you get the answer , you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway .
saw a screener of this before last year 's award season , did n't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended , but whatever , maybe for exposure , at the least , but the movie was a convoluted mess . sure , some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way , but none of the characters felt very real to me at all . there was not one person that i could connect with , and i think that is where it failed for me . sure , the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology , wow ! what a grand idea ... let 's see if that already has n't been mined to the point of futility . the whole ordeal feels fake , from the lighting , the casting , the screenplay to the horrible visual effects ( which is supposed to be intentional , i can tell , and so can everyone else , no one is laughing with you though ) . anyways , i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least , i would n't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed . but it 's tripe either way . boring tripe at that .
this movie is flawed on many fronts . like many before it , it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history . the production is poor , overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares . this to me was the greatest flaw - i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude . as a native texan , i grew up with the mythology . i later learned more about the history . i can accept a decent production from either perspective ( although i prefer more historical accuracy ) , but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it . even john wayne 's or fess parker 's versions had more life than this stolid mess , while being only slightly less accurate . very disappointing - avoid it .
oh man , this s-u-c-k-e-d sucked .... i could n't even get any camp value out of this ...... and i sat through the whole thing on showtime .... do n't bother waiting around for the 'naked ' scenes either ..... it 's too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved .. shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits .. i guess showtime had to throw something in at 1am ... next time i think i 'd even rather be watching espn loop around every 30 minutes ...
during the first 3 seasons fairly odd parents was as tasty as hard candy , bright and sweet and addictive . now it 's as tasty as pepto-bismol . and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you 'll need after viewing the more recent episodes , where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs . cosmo , once one of the more endearing nick characters , has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of family guy would n't even want to know . timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that bart simpson would happily beat the snot out of ( and given timmy 's snottiness , that would take a lot of beating ) . and poor wanda ... a real charmer who 's become the victim of her husband and godchild , she 's now labeled a `` nag '' for caring about the well-being of others . plus cosmo 's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he 's never punished for it , nor does he learn any lessons . which pretty much sums up butch hartman 's attitude towards kids : they 're crude , vulgar and not too bright . thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled , along with butch hartman 's darling , danny phantom . at least butch got what he deserved - unlike cosmo .
practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play evel knieval than hamilton is anthony perkins , yet somehow hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal ( and as producer of the film , he was n't likely to be fired or told he was n't right for the part ! ) the early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks . the film opens with a rather silly prologue with hamilton in his white-leather , star-spangled gear spouting the world according to knieval as if to say , `` do n't worry . this film is about my youth , but i 'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture . '' hamilton is preparing for a huge jump , yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife lyon both supports and derides him . he recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity . this flip-flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed , but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters . hamilton , usually a suave and debonair persona , does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject 's mannerisms and demeanor including his walk . his hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking . ( he even pays minor tribute to knieval 's many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in `` scars '' from the multitudinous accidents . ) facially , he looks nothing like the real cyclist , but he does suggest him in his physical performance . lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife , though her 3-pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment . she and hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over . other nice supporting turns are given by freed as his jaded doctor , cameron as an early influence and taylor as a flea-bitten sideshow barker . the film was made on a low budget , but the story is a rather low rent one anyway , so that does n't affect it too badly . the makers wisely used actual butte , montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance . several of hamilton 's antics are amusing , though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people 's property ! some of the real knieval 's completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage , one of which features a mind-boggling `` splatter '' in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll . hamilton 's then-wife ( stewart ) appears briefly as a nurse .
there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death . the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i could n't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better . this truly was a horror film . i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that i will never get back . the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss . please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them .
how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck ? i just do n't get it . trick or treat managed to do it . this sucks and likes it . trick or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about . it is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself . trick or treat has no redeeming factors . for a movie about heavy metal , it sure does n't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents . this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986 , probably one of heavy metal 's strongest hours . that is quite a feat , however negative . trick or treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it . that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film .
ok this movie was really `` unique '' shall we say . carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie , even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie . but she said that she ca n't remember to much of it . well thats her excuse but whats everyone else 's ? ? ? i ca n't imagine they all had a coke problem.whatever it was n't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments . although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste . oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her .
... am i missing something here ? ? ? `` unexpected plot developments '' ? `` plot twisting with subversive glee '' ? are these viewers watching the same arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself ( in an now-obvious sub ( un ) conscious bout of sadomasochism ) ... i just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker ... this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved ... quick question : did sir stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs-up to kate c. ? if so , then it must be the same spielberg who greenlighted `` howard the duck '' ... do n't give me that , `` it was a hit play '' crap -- i 'm guessing mssr . reddin ai n't too pleased ... the dvd cover promised `` surprising corners '' and a `` twisted story ... '' story ! ! story ? ? it 's crap like this that make old bobby mckee and his wandering band of structuralists sound like geniuses ... sundance ? ? berlin ? ? toronto ? ? i have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than arquette 's negatively-dimensional portrayal of anguished loss ... and , talk about deux ex machina for mr. stanley t. ; thank god , just in the nick o time he thought to have dave call the cops ! and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer ... what ! ! ! up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against arquette and his `` hidden millions '' ... no , mrs. spielberg , you do n't escape unscathed : what the hell was that kitchen scene with the `` athlete 's foot in my crotch '' gag ? ? ? are you worse in this or `` just cause '' ? ? i dunno ... hey film lovers : why do n't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with `` jersey girl '' and `` white chicks '' and then commit sepukka ( or is it seppuka ) ... and take e. dunsky with you ....
the directors cut version , which was the one i saw , was very long for this type of movie . almost two hours is way too long . if you have the choice , definitely go for the non-directors cut . the main plot is almost not taken up at all , the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes , which are connected but the feeling is that they 're only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence . the connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before i was there . as a horror movie it does n't work . you never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition ( character is presented , 15 minutes later character is dead ) . this pictures strong side lies in the splatter part .
... just look at the poor robert webber character ( great performance , once again ! ) who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists . everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong . the biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies ( the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic , ironic and therefore timeless die hard ) . the story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the sas commandos . ideas like when a commando shouts heads down '' all good guys do it and all bad guys do n't so that they can blast away ad lib ( with a good conscience ) , that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously . and it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun . do n't talk about the toilet-mirror-signal episode ... i do n't mind the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled , even headed representatives of power in this movie . but the political comment is rather lame and uninspired . this is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of judy davies . she plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject '' . anyway , her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow i feel the movie let her down .
30 seconds into the opening credits , i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie , but i did n't know just how bad . then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie , we 'll have to turn the volume down , make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd . but that did n't help . about half way through we turned it off . now , i 've lived through some very bad movies before , both with and without the aide of `` mystery science theater 3000 '' and `` svengoolie , '' but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save . the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they 're zombies had rotting green skin . i guess they were all hypnotized into death , then hypnotized into rotting themselves . stick to the real b-movie cult classics like `` plan nine from outer space . ''
i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible ! they are rich little kids who do n't have any talent , and probably just begged nick to accept them ! alex has played the drums for one yearm , i 've played for 4 1/2 ! the movie is terrible and so is the show ! this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i 've ever seen . it is so stupid it makes me want to barf ! ! ! it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb ! they are sooo stupid and weird ! i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off !
heavily re-edited and often confusing , the original screen version of man on fire was at least ten years out of date when it was made and the passing years have n't made it any better . this is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience make to get attention and everyone else does just to pay off their outstanding alimony or their drug dealer , with scott glenn 's bodyguard going out on a limb to rescue his 12-year-old charge , the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy italian family . an interesting cast - joe pesci , brooke adams , danny aiello , jonathan pryce - have all done better , the action is sluggish and sparse and only john scott 's exceptionally fine score ( part of which turned up in the last reel of die hard ) makes a positive impression . one case where the remake ( made by tony scott , the original choice of director for this version ) is an improvement .
david lean 's worst film . even 'in which we serve ' was'nt as bad as this . usually a film with a really good reputation like this one , has at least some redeeming qualities , which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic . but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945 ! i disliked the acting , stiff upper lip british mannerisms , story , script ( which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny ) and soundtrack . the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive , but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice . just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation . another very overrated 'british classic ' .
kurt thomas in one of the series of gymnast olympic stars turned movie stars movies that mercifully only includes one other .. mitch gaylord in american anthem ... at least that one had janet jones .. this one has ... um ... a gymnast using his martial arts and his gymnastic skills to save a european country from dictatorship .. sure it could happen .. on a scale of one to ten .. a 0
how did this ever come into existence ? i generally love sci f/bigfoot whatever films etc . . . but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this . the effects were sad , the lines were sadder . avoid at all costs . i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case ( i was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it -- still have n't seen that one ) . the idea of the film is actually a good one . there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here . i just do n't understand how something like this ends up like this . go speak to the film/arts/english interested students in any high school and you 'll find people who can write a better script .
i did n't think the french could make a bad movie , but i was , clearly , very wrong . as has been said before , this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure ; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi . the script is awful -- pretentious , stilted , and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting , rather than retelling , history . along with some fairly decent set design , valentina cervi 's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie , and it 's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too ; they waste no time in contriving various `` erotic '' sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development . unfortunately , the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal can not , and does not , sustain this movie . the acting is unremarkable , and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two . the cinematography is ok , and there are some pretty colors , but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama . in any event , the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia 's body , and all too seldom on her paintings . all told , a near-complete failure . it 's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film , and it 's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography . so the french can fail , after all !
people love the original story for its ending . the hollywood style ending made this 99 version of ' a dog of flanders ' just for kids movie . i did n't cry this time because the story was too hollywood . japanese tv series are much better .
this movie is really goofy ! i saw it as an 11 year old , and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous ! i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 . i really did n't care for it , but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of , such as : 1 ) does money buy happiness ? 2 ) should i lie ( to my parents ) about things i think they would n't approve of ? 3 ) does money buy friendships ? 4 ) is money everything ? 5 ) should n't i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me ? granted , these are very unrealistic situations , but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children , maybe they should watch this video as well , in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt .
one of the requirements of science fiction , at least before it starts to become satire , is that it be somewhat plausible . i would think that an anti-matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended . but i 'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen solar crisis . it is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand . they 're getting close to earth , so much so that it 's become unseasonably hot , as if the entire earth were death valley . the answer is an anti-matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there . that will divert the flares off in say the direction of say mercury providing it 's not in direct alignment with the earth . who to deliver it , but captain tim matheson and his crew . that is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son , corin nemec . taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral charlton heston , matheson 's father , and nemec 's grandfather . there 's a villain here too , peter boyle who is the ceo of a multi-national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world 's food supply for the survivors . the idea he might not survive does n't enter into his thinking . he 's doing his best to sabotage matheson 's mission . solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 , a space odyssey and voyage to the bottom of the sea . boyle seems to be taking his cue from gene hackman as lex luthor in superman , apparently he 's the only one in the cast who realizes he 's in a turkey and overacts accordingly . the rest of the cast are stalwart , true blue and dull . except possibly desert rat jack palance who finds nemec and cares for him . the key here is that the film was directed by that noted hollywood purveyor of flop films , allen smithee . the film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a thanksgiving carving .
once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be , and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap . there is absolutely no talent included in this film - from a crappy script , to a crappy story to crappy acting . amazing ...
i wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules : this movie is aweful ! from the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors . i was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination ( ca n't extend flaps without engines ) . the landing gear can not be lowered unless you have electricity . that tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear . the one thing i thought was quite peculiar is when they landed , the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off , thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air . how did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that were n't touching the ground ? did they forget the spoilers ? word to the director : find out * all * you can about planes before attempting a `` plane '' movie . sorry for the technical rant , but i give this movie 1/10 .
boring , long , pretentious , repetitive , self-involved  this move felt like a bad date . worse , the tedious art-school direction -- with a heavy-handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up - is constantly screaming to be noticed . add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue , and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in . it gets worse : instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice-overs and quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters . really loud opera music too . blame it all on the director . the actors are all quite good . the lead actor miguel angel hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom . he and the other actors have some tender erotic moments . even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however , and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a bel ami porn job . the stunning college campus architecture as a location in mexico city is inspiring . how come universities in the us are so bland ( sfsu , uc , etc. ) ? but wait for the dvd on this film . you 'll want to use the fast scan button  a lot .
you ca n't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days , and i had expected it to be campy anyway . ( it 's not all that campy in reality . with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter , who do n't take themselves seriously , the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight ; riley smith is exceptionally bad . ) the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to , which kind of shocked me ; i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story , but they use lots of words like `` technological '' and `` physicality '' in the script to get their point across . ( although it 's possible that the story is important only to explain why there 's so few cast members . ) nobody cares about this stupid storyline , and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms ( which are n't all that edgy ) . i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason . the film is grainy , with a tv-quality look and acting level . there are a few `` sexy '' scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers , feeling themselves up ; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny . and i liked the digs at l. ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones , but it still is n't any good . 3/10
i saw and liked the first two a lot , really . especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first . and it 's a story standing alone . you do n't have to know the first movie . i liked that in the `` free willy '' movies , too . but ... the third , here is absolutely useless ! i tried it with a friend of mine , because we both liked the first two . we decided to stop after a good half an hour . the movie is okay , there are funny parts in it alright . but what for ? timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies . what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is : a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already , plus telling the story from their point of view . but what for ? i 'd really like to know . you know , the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one , is really nice . but what comes after is mostly unnecessary . i guess many people liked timon and pumba , and so do i really . yet , for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny . no chance , most of it was n't funny at all , at least for me . btw . what was the movie about anyway ? was it a ) about timon and pumba or b ) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie ? i tend to choose option b and i 'm very disappointed about it . if you like to see stories like : `` the story behind xy '' , you should see `` rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead '' by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman . that 's really funny and no try to get more out of `` hamlet '' then it has .
do you like stand up ? then stay away from this ... during the early rounds , there are in fact good comics , but unless they got some cute qualities , they got a snowballs chance . any controversial material and you are out ! ... and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians , when i see who the crooked judges are letting in . 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries . half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs . several of them have lifted their material elsewhere , something the judges does n't seem to have problems with . it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv , but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been . if the producers changed the name of the contest to `` last clown standing '' , all my criticism would loose validity . maybe an idea ?
after life is a miracle , i did not expect much . it 's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell , for instance . zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story . the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here . it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies , beginning with black cat , white cat , which i think was great , but already had some disturbing signs of dementia . i liked his early films so much , and this is why it 's especially disappointing to see something like this . let 's hope his next one will be great .
i have yesterday seen the second part . and i must say , it was actually better then the first one . at the begin , i realized , it is actually a sequel , not a remake but not a good one . i do not like the old movies and series of galactica , because the cylons saw like toasters ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie ) and were completely harmless for the old galactica . this movie turns the sides - the humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . many scenes were unnecessary , for instance the story of the `` computer expert '' - completely a crap . if i were a scriptwriter i would leave him die in his house , killed by the cylon woman . and the evacuation from the planet ? oh , please if it would be bombed by 50 megatons ( why exactly 50 mt ? ? ) nukes , they would be dead killed by the radiation . and how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ? aha , it was possibly this computer virus , created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy . the good side of the movie is , that the humans are at last defeated ! ! really defeated , the population is near the extinction ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie : 1. a baby ! ! ! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence ... ) . and the bad-asses won and i think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie . i also appreciate the design of the cylons ( not only of the humanoid cylon : - ) a good job with these ships - i like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons . the human ships are a good never version of the old ones . and galactica - really pretty with these docks , i liked that . but this is all , only the design is not enough . the acting was really bad , the whole plot was expectable ( only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end ) .the dialogs were trivial ( and in the slovak dabbing just stupid , but that is not fault of the movie ) . the whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series , but who would shoot such series ? what it would be about ? one star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity .
in short , the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing , somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast , and the 3rd act ... there virtually was n't any 3rd act ! regarding the 3rd act , the movie just abruptly ends . there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act , so there was n't much of a 3rd act . the bad guys die and that 's that ; the end credits roll . there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on . the audience would 've likely left the theater after the movie , asking `` that 's it ? '' a real letdown . music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time , but it 's certainly nothing outstanding . it 's just functional , but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative . it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion . what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from `` 48 hrs . '' and `` commando , '' particularly the brass . in all , the film had potential as the basic story itself is good , but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction , weak acting , and somewhat inconsistent pacing . there was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story , and this omission is major and unforgivable as it does n't allow the movie to end satisfactorily . this could either be the screenplay or , possibly , the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints ( but i 'm speculating as to why there is n't a 3rd act ) . whatever the reason , the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall . this is good for a view if you 're curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the 3 acts ( beginning , middle , end ) if you write screenplays and make movies . otherwise , you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laughs out of it .
the show is average . it does n't make me laugh particularly . however , i think courtney really brings it down . she does n't look natural . she has these three ways to talk , all robotic . she talks quietly ( with no intonation ) , she talks normally ( with no intonation ) , or she does that thing where she starts talking normally , and starts yelling gradually . however , her yelling is like `` let 's pretend i 'm yelling because i should n't be too loud on the set '' . she is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing . it 's annoying . you ca n't really get her personality , because she does n't really produce emotion , and does n't get upset . she has this husband , who 's doing all these stupid things , and there is no reaction from her . very dry and plain acting .
i love b movies .. but come on .... this was n't even worth a grade ... the ending was dumb ... b/c there was no real ending ! ! ! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... i mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ? ? slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period ... and i wo n't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head .... and then you do n't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called `` new jigsaw puzzle '' .... unless you have nothing better to do ... id watch paint dry before id recommend this god-forsaken movie to anyone else ... oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window .. that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria . so did n't have an idea what i am going to see . the story is very normal . the movie is very long , i believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story . its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! ashton kutcher was very good . kevin costner is ok . the movie is speaking about the us coast guards , how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face . as there are n't much effects in the movie . so if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema . would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds .
kitten natividad , of russ meyer film fame , plays chastity knott , a woman who has found she has breast cancer , so she goes to south america to get some special fruit ( crockazilla ? ) that is supposed to have healing powers . after going down on some of this fruit ( which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks ) chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super-hero , specifically , the double d avenger . note that she 's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask . in writing , that all sounds pretty good . in execution , well , it leaves more than a little to be desired . it seems that chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she 's taking away their business so some of the strippers ( including haji , also of russ meyer film fame ) go after her to ruin her . of course , chastity fights back in the guise of the double d avenger . watch her do a `` wonder woman '' type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force . bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow . with the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70 's `` live action '' kid 's show with adult content , although while this is unrated it could probably get away with pg-13 at the worst . and it 's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered . this makes doris wishman 's chesty morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison . special appearance by forest j. ackerman but so what . very stupid , and i 'm never buying another film with joe bob briggs on the cover . 2 out of 10 .
i am a guy , who loves guy movies ... i was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with cool special effects . all of this happened , however , this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . the story was standard , but the portrayal of the story was terrible . the scene transitions were the worst i have ever seen . why would you walk out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger ? the serpent dragon 's actions itself was very poorly written ... and the serpent dragon 's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie , several times the main characters should have died . the director attempted to infuse a love story in the middle of the movie during the most stressful times , this movie was obviously not watched after it was made , i love movies , but had to force myself to finish watching it , thank god i did not buy this , i borrowed it from a friend . do not buy this , do not rent it , just watch discovery channel ... much more exciting .
i like bad movies . i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration . then there are abhorrent movies like this . redline is not just a bad movie , but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please , for the sake of the viewer , at least proofread scripts before funding a movie . if a stereotype took a crap , this movie would spawn from that . the storyline is unbearable , and the acting all around is laughable . nadia bjorlin and eddie griffin have , perhaps , the worst screen chemistry i 've seen in a good while , and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants ( about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for ) . furthermore , how angus macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i ca n't even think of an analogy . i am a loyal fan of his , but this has made me question him . to sum it up . several people want revenge for different reasons ( and if you care enough to know what they are , you 're a bigger person than me ) , so much so that it turns to violence ( i guess ) . the movie is like ouroboros , the snake that swallows its own tail , in that it 's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears . this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half , and an indecipherable action movie for the rest , it should be avoided at any and all costs . i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie , and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll . p.s . nadia bjorlin , if that was you singing those two songs in this movie , then you are a hack , and i hope old age ravages you . p.s.s . if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience , listen for the lyrics to nadia bjorlin 's awesome songs .
good films can not solely be based on a beautiful garden and a hill top . surprised to see it has won two awards . extremely overrated . i first saw that kind of films from china , visually stunning but also with really something captivating to say , well , more than 10 years ago and i 'm sure there are still more coming up . this is not one of them , i 'm afraid .
this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood . the performances were horrible . even boman irani , who always manages to shine , goes completely ott as the villain . the soundtrack is not memorable either . and in spite trying hard , the female leads do n't manage to be `` sexy '' . vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being . but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor . esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written cliché roles . it 's high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat . hope he never directs another eyesore like this . future of hindi movies are in better hands now . to sum it up , stay far away from waste of celluloid .
i bought this video at walmart 's $ 1 bin . i think i over-paid ! ! ! in the 1940s , bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios ( in this case , monogram -- the ones who made most of the bowry boys films ) . while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ( ed wood `` classics '' such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space ) , they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans . i am an old movie junkie , so i gave this a try . besides , a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good -- just not this one . lugosi is , what else , a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides . they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had -- so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all . anyways , a really annoying female reporter ( a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman ) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen ! so , she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi . lugosi 's home is complete with his crazed wife , a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant 's sons ( an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf ) . naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film -- apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand ! eventually , the maniacs all die -- mostly due to their own hands and all is well . at the conclusion , the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry . and , naturally , the reporter 's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs . if you have n't noticed , there 's a lot of fainting in this film . or , maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep !
i do n't know what it is about this movie- director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie . i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist , but this movie may be the most important of all time . this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made ' . i 've seen bad movies in my lifetime , but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine . everything in this movie is hilarious , but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie . oh wow ...
i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system . i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting . on top of that , i 'm a fan of max fleischer 's work , and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon . with both of those , i thought it would hold my interest . i was wrong . just a few minutes in , and i had the fast forward button down . i ran through it in about 15 minutes , and thought that was it . afterwards , i read some of the other reviews here and figured i did n't give it enough of a chance . i recorded it again and watched it through . there 's 75 minutes of my life i 'm not getting back . i ca n't believe there are n't more bad reviews . personally , i think it 's because it 's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum . how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time ? the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts , profanity , and puke jokes . the characters are flat . the parody of `` swinging the alphabet '' is lame , essentially cobbling the tune , getting through a - e , hitting the obvious profanity a `` f '' , and then having no idea where to go . the trip through the intestines to the expected landing does n't work the first time , let alone the following ones . across the board , the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to `` out-south park '' stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and is n't funny . this might be amusing if you 're high . otherwise , it 's not .
oh dear lord . this movie ... it was horrible . i am a huge fan of horror movies . and most of the time , horror movies other people say are bad , i like . the actor who played 'scarecrow ' was amazing , i will say that . but this plot was awful . it made no sense ! it had way too much gore , and an unnecessary ( and revolting ) sex scene at the beginning . i do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking ' or whatnot , but it just came out awful . to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot , the actors ( besides 'scarecrow ' ) we 're awful , and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who . in conclusion , this movie made me sick . if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway , please do .
`` look , i know this may suck right now , but pain is temporary , film is forever . whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come . ''  robert de niro this was initially a film for steven spielberg , the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes . and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro . like `` jurassic park '' , `` poltergeist '' and `` war of the worlds '' , the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast , the beast being the creation of the father , a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial . in typical spielberg fashion , the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins . like oscar schindler , robin williams , sam niel , tom cruise and virtually every `` daddy '' figure in spielberg land , the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys . but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese , who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare . the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese 's filmography , and , ironically , his most illuminating . an artist 's failures or misfires are often very revealing , exposing the inner workings of their art . when the story does n't work , the characters do n't connect or the images do n't sear , we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core . this  the remaining carcass- is what the director 's cinema is about . now `` cape fear '' is an impersonal film , so we wo n't find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese 's filmography ( `` you already sacrificed me ! '' de niro yells , but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter ) . what the film does , though , is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on . watch how scorsese 's camera desperately whips back and forth , how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention . but more importantly , watch how the film makes no spatial sense . a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage , a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family 's house does n't seem to exist anywhere in particular . there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture , scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment . the reason for this is that scorsese 's camera always has to be bound , or intimately tethered , to his central character . for the world around the character to make sense , his camera has to be focused on the character . resnais can take you around a french hotel , welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building , cameron can give you a tour of the titanic , scott can recreate an entire future cityscape , lucas can give you an alien desert planet , and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook `` close up-mid shot-wide shot '' combinations , but scorsese ca n't do this . there 's no poetry , no sense of tangible space in his films . he 's all about the character . you break that tether , you leave that boxing ring , that taxi cab , you look away from de niro , and everything collapses . he simply can not break away from this very documentarian style of shooting , which , in a way , is a prerequisite for action film-making . scorsese tried to rectify this problem with `` gangs of new york '' , where the space and the sets become the central character , but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis , the actor drawing scorsese 's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb . 5/10  even as a generic b-movie , this is an ugly , vulgar looking film . look at the matte paintings , the inept attempts at tension , the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown . still , we have robert de niro to pick up the slack . de niro , who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ , gives the film its only great scene . in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis , he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her . a kind of symbolic rape , the girl runs away , both aroused and repelled by this man 's interest . but de niro 's performance , so deliciously over the top , simply ca n't be imitated by scorsese . you 'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work . but scorsese ? nope . worth one viewing .
i like movies about ufos , which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s . and now i 'm compelled to write a review about it because i 'm afraid i 'll start forgetting everything about it fast . you see , even though ebts ai n't bad , it 's very dull and nondescript . the story is sorta interesting but flat . the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing . the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling , which , unfortunately , this one ai n't . also , there 's very little violence and there 's no nudity whatsoever , which makes this 1970s italian sci-fi opus a true oddity , because if there 's one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade , it 's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them . oddly enough , because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements , ebts stands out from the rest of the pact . i do n't know if this can be seen as a compliment though . personally , i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry . and the special effects are n't that special . the story itself is actually interesting . it 's a combo of the x-files and antonioni 's blowup : a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country . the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model , subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth . the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer 's apartment ( this taking place just before she 's to be abducted herself ) . the man takes some of the negatives and leaves , with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives . the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives . the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue , in the spy vs spy variety . the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin . but as dull as eyes behind the stars is , it does resemble the x-files a lot ! i wonder if chris carter saw this movie . anyway , the best thing in ebts are the pov shots , which are creepy and effective . but the rest is almost completely forgettable , including the goofy looking aliens . even though i 've been mostly negative about this film , i sorta cherish it nonetheless . i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid . and i own the video . the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly . oh well ...
all the kids aged from 14-16 want to see this movie ( although you are only allowed at 18 ) . they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it . i feel very sad kids ca n't see what a good movie is , and what a bad movie is . this was one of the worst movies i saw in months . every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie . and the end ? it 's an open ending ... why ? because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story . this movie is just made to make you scared , and if you are a bit smart and know some about music , you exactly know when you 'll be scared . when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told ( a bit to loud ) him that this was a total waste of money , some stupid kid looked strange at me . these day i could make an oscar with a home-video of my goldfish , if only i use the right marketing .
i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend , who , like me , is a fan of the first . this movie down right sucked ! it lacked the magic of the first . you could actually understand every word the mice said , the animation is crappy , the palace is much much different from the first movie , there 's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible , luckily the prince did n't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid . basically its like the lion king 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice . the reason i 'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable .
pedantic , overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations . begins quite promisingly , with a still-relevant probe into an airplane explosion , however the melodrama involving james stewart and wife vera miles just gets in the way ( miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress , and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule ) . esteemed director mervyn leroy helmed this adaptation of don whitehead 's book , but despite the talent involved , the picture fails to make much of an impression . best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart 's partner , however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is . * 1/2 from * * * *
this is a review of the wizard , not to be confused with the wiz , or mr. wizard . the wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy 's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits . the wiz is an unnecessary update of the wizard of oz , and mr. wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it . now that we 've gotten all that out of the way , let me say this : there 's really no reason to see this movie . it 's simply a 100 minute nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the powerglove , the legend of zelda and super mario brothers 3 . i use the word `` designed '' in the loosest sense possible , because it seems like this movie was written over a weekend by a crack team of people who had never played nintendo , and directed by a man with less sense of style than my grandmother . maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together , they 'd realize that they were about to film total rubbish and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos . i hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you . it sure has n't been for me . in fact , i think i might have lost a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it . next time you 're at the video store and you see the the wiz , the wizard and the wizard of oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row , give them all a miss and play duck hunt instead .
as you all may know , jigsaw did not make its way to blackbuster because of a member of full moon 's own staff , devin hamilton . devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains . he recently released a movie , bleed , which he was selling to blackbuster at the same time as jigsaw . he convinced the blackbuster buyer not to take any jigsaw , and double the number of bleed . the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop , and bleed looks like a hit . the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever , and as we all know , jigsaw is , well , gold . i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged jigsaw , and all of your talents . likewise , you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it ( if you already have n't ) . we need to get jigsaw up to at least an 8 or 8.5 , and bleed down to around a 2 ( thus putting it on the internet 's 100 worst movie listing ) . also , try to convince friends and family to do the same . hope you all are doing well , - matt
well , the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid . if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you . a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness . i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless . the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot . the plot , however , has little to recommend . a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano , which might appeal to some people . but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth . not recommended .
in the comic , modesty is strong . alexandra staden who plays modesty blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model . she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics . modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money . i can not see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie . its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj qualls ( in road trip ) . soo if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry . if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one.i can not understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it . i will ask for a refund at my dvd rent store tomorrow .
or maybe that 's what it feels like . anyway , `` the bat people '' is about as flat as a rug , bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as all three combined . okay , plot in a nutshell ( fitting vessel , that ... ) : a doctor ( moss ) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife ( mcandrew ) and subsequently turns into a bat - well , not exactly a bat but a bat-like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person camera viewpoint .... but then there 's the business of the sheriff ( pataki ) , who is about the worst kind of sheriff : the hick kind . he hassles people , he leers at married women , he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries ( the fiend ! ) , he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time , making him look and sound like buford t. justice in `` smokey and the bandit '' and ( this is the worst part ) ... he 's the most likeable character in the whole film ! the whole film , though , is just tv movie-of-the-week-like crapola ( guano , in this case ) . it 's an aip , for crying out loud ! what did you expect , oscar caliber stuff ? and what else can you say about a film that not even mst3k can save ? how about ... no stars for `` the bat people '' , full version or mst3k version ! by the way , if there 's ever a sequel for this movie , i 'm burying my tv .
i have done quite a few reviews on imdb and this film is unique in that i never saw the entire movie . it was so terribly stupid and unfunny that i just could n't sit through it -- though i tried . the biggest problem with this and any mel brooks movie i call `` the mel quotient '' . in other words , the better his movie , the less of him you see in the film . think about it -- the producers and young frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them at all . but , films like life stinks and space balls are chock full of mel and are pretty dopey movies ( yes , i did not like space balls -- but this is n't the place to talk about that ) . second , apart from cancer , rectal itch and mental retardation , i ca n't think of a less funny topic than homelessness . this is just a comedy breaker . think about it , folks . the funniest ( ? ) scene in the movie has mel making whoopee with leslie ann warren in a dumpster ! ! and this is funny in what way ?
i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal-mart earlier in the week . all three children actually got physically ill while watching it . i 'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate , or something they all had picked up from school , but really it could have been this film . absolutely disgusting . how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me . fortunately , i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely . for any parents out there , i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie .
whoever wrote the `` nice '' post about this must have been a friend of these guys . this is bad even for backyard wrestling . in fact this is n't even backyard wrestling really , it 's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline . each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this . it is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name , if that is possible . if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling , pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain . it stars the 2 biggest names in byw , mdogg20 and josh prohibition . these guys are good . they have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as `` real '' pro wrestlers . they went legit and have gotten better . i recommend checking out those 2 guys . mdogg is insane and off the hook . so do n't waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd , there are `` better '' back yard videos out there .
well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that i signed up for an imdb account just to warn people . it is patently awful ! ! nothing makes sense in this movie . there is way too many subplots for a start . josh hartnett 's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls ( some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work ) . add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo . harrison ford 's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the internal affairs investigator 's ex-wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which ford 's character calls from time to time . nonsense ! ! i ca n't remember the characters names ( that 's how forgettable this is ) so i 'll refer to them as ford and hartnett . then there 's the dialogue which is brutal . i mean cringe-inducing stuff here . throw in every cliché in the book ( having a heart-to-heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name ; the duo being investigated by internal affairs ( why ? ? ) ; hartnett confronting his dad 's killer ) and you 've got one hell of a mess . as i mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non-existent : 1 ) when ford 's car is being repossessed , how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked ? were they following him ? ? 2 ) when hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene ( an earring ) is replicated on of the charred bodies there ( that was lucky ! ) 3 ) when the two are arrested and taken in for questioning - ford keeps answering his phone and hartnett `` centers himself '' with a yoga pose on the table . instead of taking the phone from ford the ia guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before ford does . meanwhile the female ia officer in with hartnett is rubbing herself all over him . then , inexplicably , the two are released without answering any questions . 4 ) during the car chase hartnett 's car is crashing and smashing its way around hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again . not a scratch ! 5 ) when ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at ? ? 6 ) when the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett 's car , ford is trying to close a real estate deal . come on ! 7 ) the bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever . his motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label ? they might leave his label and it 's a warning to keep his other groups loyal . but hang on , how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan ? ? 8 ) why is the ia guy who is investigating ford arrested in the end ? there is no explication ! ! 9 ) and hartnett gets to use his `` acting '' to capture the bad guy in the end . i could go on , i really could . anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that 's all it is . there 's nothing else to it ! it 's not supposed to be satirical or ironic . it 's just crap .
the shame of it ! there i was , comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn , bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment . what did i get ? disappointed ! how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this ? the humour was dreadful , the songs were worse than country and western ( and that 's saying something ) and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew . i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island . a short tale , such as christmas carol , is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around it .... here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun . where do the muppets go next ? how about muppets wizard of oz ?
i 've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions . a bunch of kids , 14 to 22 put on the dvd of `` titanic '' on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal . only two of them had actually seen it before . but they all had seen the moment of kate , leo and celine dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie . shortly after the epic started , they started to get restless , some of them left asking the others -- `` call us when the iceberg appears '' over an hour and a half into the movie , only the two girls who had seen the movie before , were still there . they started shouting : iceberg , iceberg . a stampede followed , they all came back to see the sinking of the titanic . they sat open mouthed , emitting ohs and far outs . so , just like i thought when the movie first burst into the scene . what is this ? one and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it . dr. zivagho , for instance , had a similar running time , but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time . in `` titanic '' leo teaches kate how to spit . look at the faces and hands of the , supposedly , creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship . look at the historical details , if you can find them . the storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink . the real sinking here is of film standards . all the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends . the film went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time so , what do i know ?
first off , i would like to point out that while i am not an expert , the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence . firstly , the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning ' actually works . irresponsible for both the prosecution ( because they can get an appeal ) and the defense for not acting on this . as another commenter said , facilitated learning was proved untrue . secondly , they used terry as the translator who has personal interest , and even will testify , in the trial which is just stupid . if the court had allowed him to testify that way , they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal . thirdly , this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution ( birthmarks , details of the event , etc . ) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started , he could not answer . if that is n't reasonable doubt i do n't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal . bottom line , it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism , but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable .
i watched the first 15 minutes , thinking it was a real documentary ( with an irritatingly overly dramatic `` on camera '' producer ) . when i realized it was all staged i thought `` why would i want to waste my time watching this junk ? ? '' so i turned it off and came online to warn other people . the characters do n't act in a believable way . too much immature emotion . for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country , he acted like a kid . and i do n't believe it was because `` his character was so upset about the trade center bombings '' . very trite and stupid . have you seen `` city of lost children '' ? french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams ... i liked it !
watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements . dhl , aquawhite strips , rockstar and more . it 's one product placement after another . it 's quite obvious how this movie got its funding . jessica simpson 's `` acting '' is laughable . any dick should n't ever get work because he plays the same lame character . the `` story '' is just a backdrop for this very long commercial . i ca n't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release . the longer you watch this movie the more you 're embarrassed for everyone involved . the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook , who gets almost no screen time as jessica 's cousin . i 'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing . i would recommend avoiding this one .
i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review . i say that because those of you reading it will know that i sat through the whole thing and that is embarrassing to admit even to strangers . but i just had to warn those who read the viewer comments on imdb before they watch a film not to watch this one . it 's the least i can do . this is a bad movie ! trust me . the plot is goofy . the acting is amateurish . and the directing , camera work , sets , costumes , etc . are all second rate . let it go .
i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc . after 30 minutes , i said to him , '' you 've got to be kidding . is this some sort of joke ? '' he thought it was good . i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made . `` what was it supposed to be ? '' i asked . `` a propaganda movie made for children ? '' the plot is stupid . the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life , love or even afterlife , of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view ... need some psychiatric help . please , if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player , consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer ... it wo n't destroy your player but it will destroy your evening . if they had made razzies in the '40s , this would have won in every category . ( ps . it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of `` stairway to heaven . '' )
spoilers throughout ! ! ! ! i had read the book `` 1st to die '' and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so i watched it . for the most part it did . there were some minor differences ( location of the last violent scene for instance ) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies . this may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with pollen and bellows especially-i was not that impressed with the book . or let me take that back . i started off very impressed , gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped . no difference with the movie . here is why . there is no `` payoff '' in the book , or the movie . rarely have i read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it 's final resolution and i had hoped the movie would vary a little . the whole- ( he did it , no she did it , no they both did it ) -was not interesting , not fascinating and more confusing , annoying and depressing then anything else . add to that , that the love of lindsay 's life dies at the end ( after her disease cleares and she cries at his grave ) .. and then cut to where she 's contemplating suicide .... then all of a sudden she 's in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested .. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together .... hello ! ! ! this whole thing has now become `` general hospital '' instead of a good old fashioned thriller . i felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie ( i must admit it held my attention nicely -the acting was very good for a tv movie ) was hoping it would n't follow the book which it wound up doing . i still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book ( or maybe it 's just that i knew what would happen ) but i have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all .
when i first saw this film , i thought it should have come from the children 's section - it 's very fun and at times humorous , and is actually quite a good story , but it severely lacks the `` romantic chemistry '' that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering . i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein , and his performance is extraordinary , but that 's the sole exception . this film appears a bit forced , the directing lacks substance , and oh yeah ... the music is ridiculously awful , it did n't put me in a very good mood . but if you are not expecting a smart , well-crafted comedy/romance tale , then this certainly can be entertaining , like i said .. it should be in the children 's section . einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins ' boring , almost tense quest to steal meg ryan 's heart . a very conflicting film , but as long as it 's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie .
this film was totally not what i expected . if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two . its really strange because i can not see the point . the prequel and sequel lets just say do n't make sense , the do n't even match . maybe i am naive but ai n't a vol 1 & vol 2 meant to match up . carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original , and in the prequel he lives and do n't go jail . the plot was ok , but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film . i really expected it to end like the other one started . if some one has a opinion on this post it please .
honestly , i do n't know what 's funnier , this horrific remake , or the comments on this board . masterpiece 's review had me in tears , that 's so funny . anyway , this movie is the among the worst movies ever , and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels . the `` omen '' name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo , but it 's a slap in the face to the other three , especially the original . there are so many classically bad moments , but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair ! ! good times ! this movie is to the omen series what `` scary movie '' is to the entire genre . avoid unless you 're looking for a good laugh .
i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was ... but the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody , it felt more like an insult to the viewer 's intelligence . the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people ...
this whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum . although an interesting concept/theme , it really did not develop as a story . once the initial idea of a brave ( stupid ? ) bomb disposal expert ( cowboy ? ) are introduced , and this happens very early in the film , the rest is repetitious . characters were not explored , and aspects of the location and politics were ignored . there was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment , and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe . but the way in which the unit operated stretched belief ! individual performances were good , and special effects were adequate , but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content .
jeremy northam struggles against a `` total recall '' clone script and disposable romantic by-play to bring life to a confused character . lucy liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman-like finish . you ca n't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the dvd when she uses the term `` femme fatal '' and `` romance '' . french film-noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together . this movie fails , not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham-fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists . little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period . automobiles are very 1990 's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques . the technology is positively hilarious . massive `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' mainframes fed by man-portable cd-rom 's with data collected for some unexplained reason , in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un-savvy technologist today would obviously be aware . there is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber-community , research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time . dvd interviews also reveal the original movie name was `` company man '' but this likely ditched in order to cash in on matrix hype . the `` cypher '' title has only the slightest link with the movie . terry gilliam would have done wonders with this concept ; and completely re-written the decalogue . this is tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production . it might have made a good sub-plot for `` alias '' .
me and my friend rented this movie for $ 2.50 . and we both agree on one thing : this is the worst movie ever made ! also me and my friend counted 475 face shots . ( which makes up 95 % of the movie ) . so in other words : do see this movie unless you like wasting money ! and i do !
can fake scenery ruin a picture ? you would n't think so , but it actually for me in here . listen , i have a lot of classic-era movies and i know pretty much what to except , such as the drivers steering immobile cars in front of a screen , etc . but a lot of that hokey business has to do with action scenes . to have fake scenery , fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in `` brigadoon '' gets insulting after awhile . as far as the music entertainment went , this is always subjective . what songs one person likes , another may not so that should n't be a big part of judging a film ( whether someone likes the songs ) . i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs , dances , romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things . musicals did very well in the '50s . me , i liked the '30s and '40s with the great taps . by the '50s , tap was out and this new stuff - which i can stand - was it . does that make this a lousy movie ? no . it just makes one i did n't care for very much despite the good cast , good director and high expectations , this film bombed at the box office , and with me . i should have liked it more , being a dreamer myself and that 's a nice part of this story . i am not the cynical type and a nice town and nice people making me feel good sounds awful appeal . then why could n't i connect with this film ? part of it also was the dancing . i do n't care for the stuff that replaced tap dancing on screen . but - no - the thing really turned me off what that staging . there was no scotland , no highlands , just a hokey- looking background to make it look that way and it turned me almost from the start . score one point for today 's realism where they `` go on location '' most of the time .
the film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened . the crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around . you can fill in the rest . this is a paycheck picture all around . there seems to be no passion in anyone 's performances , nor in anyone behind the camera . this is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else . on some level this should have worked , it could have been a more horrific southern comfort ( where national guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps ) , but instead its not much of anything . in large part you can blame the script , written unbelievably in part by wes craven , which hits the same old targets again and again . add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene . its not bad as such , but badly made and dull . let me put my feelings into context : the reason i saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the last mimzy and i wanted to see what caused the out cry ( i mean the films have so much in common-he says sarcastically ) . i 'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last mimzy .
i love all types of films , especially horror . that being said , survival does not live up to any of the hype surrounding it . i ca n't give it any points on originality . there is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes , or remaking what others have done . it has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods , a crazed killer , and as of lately , throw in some crazy family . on those lines i have to compare it with the likes of texas chainsaw , wrong turn ( though the twist in that one is obvious ) , and others . survival falls up way short against comparable films . the plot was just not original in any way . some films can get by with a weak ( and way over-done ) plot with superb acting , special fx , or a slew of other factors . survivial does n't have any of that to bank on . if you will , note the following : the acting in the movie never took off . i do n't knock or blame the actors for that , nor the director . the dialogue was at best mediocre , and the actors involved never showed ( not saying did n't have ) the talent to pull it off . i mention 2 standouts . the leading man in this film certainly has the look , but i seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film . the actor who portrayed greg also had potential , but we never got to see any of it ( watch the movie to see why , you wo n't believe it .. ) . the grainy film look . ah yes , that little tid-bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of `` grindhouse '' films . in today 's film making , that has become a gimmick . it either works or it does n't . in this case it just does not work . there are too many other flaws going on , so it winds up distracting from the film , not adding to it . that being said , i think they did a good job of adding that grain . that is some good , quality grain . i think with a different script , better direction , and possibly actors , they should try another `` grindhouse '' attempt . they will probably pull it off . as far as the tech aspects , in my opinion , they never quite gelled for me either . better care could have been taken with audio ( sounds like it was fed directly into the camera , but there is nothing wrong with that ) and for being shot on dv , it was too soft for my taste . that is all i have to say about that .....
i liked chiba in street fighter , and i figured hey , no matter how stupid this movie will be , i 'll at least get to see him kick some ass , right ? wrong . this is a dull , dreary mess of pointless talking , half-assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming . there are few action scenes of any kind , even fewer martial arts scenes , and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you ca n't even make out what in the world is going on . the dub is also atrocious , and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia ... except they 're all japanese ! avoid like the plague -- you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes .
hood of the living dead is about a young scientist named rick who lives with his brother in the town of oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets . then one night , rick 's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier . desperate , rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they 've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health . the formula has n't been tested on a human , or even a dead body but rick is determined to bring his brother back to life . he gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens . so rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh . now rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead . hood of the living dead is one piece of trash . the plot is a direct rip off of resident evil , the acting is just horrible especially with rick ' s fake crying for his brother , the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out , and the make up is just lame . it 's only fake blood covered over the actors face . the zombies are also modified . they run , growl , and must be shot in the heart to die ! zombies should only scuffle , moan , and must be shot in the brain to die ! this film is so horrible , the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film . hood of the living dead gets a 3 out of 10 , a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest .
i saw this movie on t.v . this afternoon and i ca n't see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash . it 's not funny at all and it takes your i.q . down a few notches . i know this movie is for kids , but that does n't mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted . i bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a ) the word `` poop '' equals big laugh . b ) a four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net . c ) kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d ) 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so-called `` ninjas '' with swords . one good thing i can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban `` gang '' in the world that could n't scare anybody . maybe the guys at mst3k could use this movie for a good laugh . do n't bother with this lame-ass excuse for a movie .
ok so i am like most people , give me free tickets and i will go and see most things , now that multiplex cinemas are so good ( i remember the old `` flea pit '' single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of 40 ) . in england this film was released as `` liar '' , it 's a dog . it is a total waste of good celluloid . 4/10 for the photograpy and set only .
- i had planned to write something explaining what i did n't like about this movie , but this is going to be more difficult than i thought . honestly , i ca n't remember much about it . i watched it just three days ago and it 's made almost no impression on me . that 's usually the sign of a real stinker . about the only thing i remember was being incredibly bored by most of it . the novelty of having a humphrey bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick . it would be different if he could act , but he 's a one-note entertainer . the kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them . if you ca n't spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see more euro horror . the casting is a dead giveaway to the killer 's identity .
when ben ( red foxx ) discovers his wife beatrice ( pearl bailey ) has run off with his own brother , he rushes to his son norman ( michael warren ) to unload his tale of woe -- only to discover that norman has a secret lover : the effeminate garson ( dennis dugan . ) needless to say , ben does not take it well , and numerous complications follow -- including ben 's attempt to get norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker ( tammy dobson . ) unfortunately , this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself . originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam bobrick , norman ... is that you ? was an absolute disaster on the new york stage . to give the play its due , i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production -- and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce , the cast played so broadly and in such drop-dead manner that it proved quite amusing . it is a pity the cast of this film did n't do the same . this is an atrociously performed motion picture . red foxx , one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century , is about as funny here as yesterday 's wash , michael warren ( who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect ) competes with foxx to see who can give the worst performance , and pearl bailey is not far behind ; truth be told , only dennis duggan , tammy dobson , and a cameo by wayland flowers have any spark -- and sadly , that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast . not only is the film badly performed , it looks bad . according to film lore , this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape , which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes -- and believe me , it shows . the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of norman and garson 's apartment . some films are so bad that they become funny , but norman ... is that you ? is n't one of them . i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words : miss it . do n't buy it , do n't rent it , do n't touch it with a ten foot pole . just back away slowly and then run like hell . gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer
this type of plot really does have a lot of potential , but it was butchered here . honestly , i sensed the cheese element in the beginning , but i thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . whoa , i was wrong ! so mad scientist makes a monster , wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them , but of course they escape . after that , it 's really bad . i should 've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage , but i most likely would have lost count . pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks . i hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film . oh , and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island , there 's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting shakespeare ... this is one where you 'll find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .
'say yes ' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better , but it never does . it 's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple ' crapfest , so beloved of straight to video film-makers . the dialogue is clunky and , in several places , poorly translated . the acting is uniformly poor , especially from the villain of the piece , played by joong-hoon park . he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening , when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple . the plot deserves special mention , as it is idiotic beyond all belief . the 'heroes ' do n't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them . the 'heroine ' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her . the villain gets past a police checkpoint ( while wearing a shirt covered in blood , and a bloody head bandage ) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving . the villain is punched , clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork , but never seems to be impeded by these , rather serious , injuries . and do n't even get me started on that terrible 'twist ' ending . sheesh . the only plus point in this film , for me , is sang mi chu . who is very pretty , but really no more than a mediocre actress . overall , this film comes off like a poorly written , flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher ' and 'spoorloos ' , but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved .
when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following . the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside . it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . on a per capita basis europe , britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per-capta basis the actual size of neo-nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america . it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra-right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society . by doing so greenstreet , deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie . this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology . this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition . greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies , the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy . movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash . sensationalism at its worst anti -usa garbage shameful .
this film is totally garbage . some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class . nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis . disgusting . if this kind of a movie is set in us , it will sure make itself a big joke . and simply because it comes out from 'the other side ' , it makes itself a masterpiece , a wonderful amusement for certain brain-washed and/or brain-washing westerns ( some george w. maybe : ) . a typical cold-war sequelae , some kind of joke anyway . i would say , if this -- like expressed in this film -- is all what soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years , then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through . but no ! 'cause like many others , i 've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding soviet intellectuals . for example , something also relevant with dog , `` white bim black ear '' -- both gavriil troyepolsky 's book and stanislav rostotsky 's movie -- is a real masterpiece . real life , real tragedy , real sad , real pride and dignity , one of the real best of the soviet era .
another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot-on-video quality of the film . it was n't that bad . rochon does a serviceable job and damn ! the cast is good looking . i 've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis . this movie really wanted to make you think rochon was the killer , but it was not to be . my biggest problem with the film was that by the end , i did n't much care who was the killer , and the real killer made little sense , since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha , betcha did n't see that one coming , sucker ! ' . yeah , there were continuity errors about ( mainly with ms. rochon 's ever-changing wardrobe ) , but for an indie slasher it 's not that bad . i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless , but that was just a gimmick . the dialog was overly think and painful at times . just do n't have high expectations going into this , and it wo n't be that bad . and lloyd kaufman 's cameo is wonderfully understated .
dolph lundgren stars as a former cop/boxer who searches boston 's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother , who was well thought of in the community , however along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame . dolph lundgren is very good in this movie , in fact on the basis of his performance here , one would forget lundgren 's rise to fame involved action roles . that said the material gives lundgren nothing to work with , in fact , lundgren is completely left out to dry in a dreary thriller which is both predictable and incomprehensible . co-star danielle brett is also good , in fact the film works best when it centers around the chemistry of lundgren and brett , indeed had the film taken the time to explore their relationship the film would 've been fairly decent . however the movie is lackluster , the action is non-existent , the plot not given enough exploration ( too much boring b.s around lundgren 's investigation of his brother 's employer ) and the film is needlessly gory and ridiculous . once again , lundgren is actually really good ( as is newcomer danielle brett ) but the film just lumbers from one sequence to the next , which makes this movie particularly disappointing . if anything else though , it shows how underrated lundgren is , as an actor . * 1/2 out of 4- ( poor )
i ca n't believe i actually sat through the whole thing . this movie has the worst acting since killjoy . here is a brief outline of the plot : the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach , drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach `` hunk '' who looks like he has n't been to the gym a day in his life . somehow , everyone knows him , and every single chick in the movie wants him . uh oh ! here comes the competition ! the stereotypical `` hot chick '' and her best friends , who drive an ugly pink car . we soon find out jojo 's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia , which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind ( oh no , i think i 'm gon na cry ) . a huge storm comes , and fills their swimming pool with nasty water . somehow , for no apparent reason , the little chick falls into the pool , and comes face to face with , yup , you guessed it , a mermaid ! this is where the `` story '' really takes off . basically , they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the `` hunk '' . this is a preteen flick with acting so bad , it makes the 80 's look like the pinnacle of oscar-worthy performances . this movie has all the clichés possible ... the best friends , the `` hunk '' who everyone wants , the `` hot '' bad girl and her bitchy friends , the scary old man ... you name it , it 's in there . i took one for a lot of people by watching this . consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you . please , do n't see this movie . do n't make it so i suffered in vain .
never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film.i found it unbelievable , lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted.a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue . perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it did n't fit into any genre , it did n't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense , in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters !
i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family . this movie could have been so much more . the trouble ? it was set during the big action movie craze . i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing . i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause . yes it had funny scenes ( or laughable ) though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes . if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge . i give this movie a low number . it may not have been this low if i had not read the book .
the brothers quay are directors , judging by conventional thought , should have stuck to making short films . i myself actually really liked their first feature , institute benjamenta , but judging by their sophomore effort , the piano tuner of earthquakes , i 'm willing to agree they do n't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length . piano tuner is , without a doubt , a gorgeous film to look at , and often to listen to . unfortunately , it 's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace . reading the plot synopsis , it sounds like a pretty good story . but the brothers fail miserably to bring it to life . one thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future : dialogue . my god , it 's awful here . a huge bust .
growing up , joe strummer was a hero of mine , but even i was left cold by this film . for better and worse , the future is unwritten is not a straightforward `` behind the music '' style documentary . rather it is a biographical art film , chock full of interviews , performance footage , home movies , and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from `` animal farm . '' the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour . the campfire format , while touching in thought , is actually pretty annoying in execution . first off , without titles , its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are . secondly , who really needs to hear people like bono , johnny depp , and john cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man ? they were not relevant to strummer 's life and their opinions add nothing to his story . this picture is at it 's best when strummer , through taped interviews and conversation , touches on facets of his life most people did not know about : the suicide of his older brother , coming to terms with the death of his parents , the joy of fatherhood . to me , these were most moving because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved , but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face . there have been better , more straightforward documentaries about strummer and the clash . ( westway , vh1 legends , and kurt loder 's narrated mtv documentary from the early 90 's come to mind . ) joe strummer : the future is unwritten is for diehards only .
i 've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons : 1 ) this is , without doubt , the worst film i 've ever seen 2 ) unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3 ) i was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it . i 've seen it in shops for 15 pound . don not pay that much for this film ! you will be very angry 4 ) there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating ( in my opinion ) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal the plot summary : a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well , the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else . our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings , baby-sitting . he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police . why is it so bad ? to begin with the acting is very very bad . someone else compared it to a school production . no , this is worse than any acting i 've seen on a school stage . i 've bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this . okay , the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense . what was the point in making this film when there is n't even any gore ! okay , no gore . what else can a film like this offer ? breats ? no , not even any titillation ! it 's true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer/watcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is , at best , worth only one out of ten .
almost as tedious to watch as it was to read , evening is a gorgeously produced failure ... until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff . vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher . perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying . i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas . it gave me a headache .
i watched free money last night & it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life . with such an intriguing cast , i really thought that i was in for a treat - especially since i 'm a brando fan . wrong ! what a waste of talent . it 's almost embarrassing to watch at times ( like the cattle prod scene ) , & there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups ( why did n't they show charlie sheen 's character going back to tow brando 's truck ? ) ugh . it tries to be a slapstick comedy , but i just was n't buying into it . skip this one . only for die-hard brando fans . i 'm giving it 2 out of 10 because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo .
this film was positively the worst film i have ever watched . i could n't sit through the whole thing . i also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping ... i mean what was that all about ! i cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have # ingwasted a £4 rental fee . the quality both picture and sound are terrible , the acting ... well does n't exist . it was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee , crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup . urghh ....... avoid at all cost ! the girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they 'd be willing to take their tops off ... while these girls have nice bodies it certainly did n't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears . this was like ( possibly worse ) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car ? ! definatey not one to buy folks . sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but i could not find anything positive to say and i would like to think i may save someone else wasting their money like i have .
it started out with an interesting premise . i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies . the more the film progressed , the more i realized that this was a b movie at best . in the latter half , it quickly became a c movie , then d , then f , then `` i wish that this was n't a rental so that i could put it in the microwave ! '' i ca n't say that the acting in all cases was awful , just most . the writing , however ... i never read the book . maybe the book is well written . the screenplay was written by a 10 year old . it was ridiculously shallow , the dialog drab and uninteresting , the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer . i really hated this movie , as did my wife . i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity . this movie did a great disservice to the cause . awful , terrible , worthless . if you liked it , i strongly recommend superman 4 .
follows the same path as most sequels . first one was great . second was average and this one , full of bad acting and some stupid dialog and well as a lot of suspension of disbelief , this movie was weak . too predictable and i just could n't stand that henry wrinkler-like boss with that stupid eye , there was so much more they could have done with this . i liked the first one a lot . i wish they would have went more down those lines , rather than what they did here . there was too much unexplained that needed to be explained , what time period this was in and why why why is there an old fashioned phone in that room ? i understand there is another one in the works . blah !
this movie was disgusting . their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage . what is garbage ? the misuse of peoples time , the misuse of energy , and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write . talia you are a sick demented loser . your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem . the acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage . i ended up at a scene that was uncalled for . if you want to learn how to shock people watch a larry clark movie . i lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie `` no more support from me . '' how could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho ? i feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene . i think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is ; congratulations you won his attention .
ringmaster , jerry springer 's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film . first of all , it was made . second of all , people went to see it . third , some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen . if a monkey could make a movie , i 'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good . most crappy movies have their moments , ( even godzilla had a few cool special effects ) this film 's moment was when i left the theater nauseated . the only thing that possibly could 've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star . if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half , i 'll take a dump in a can . if anyone did n't utterly despise this movie , i pity you , and your children , and your children 's children 's children ; however , contrary to springer 's beliefs , i clearly do n't condone children having sex .
i have seen some pretty bad movies , and this is right up there . no plot to speak of , it 's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap-opera . i just wanted to smack that little girl because , well lets just say , she 's real suspicious all the way through the movie . the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny . i also saw a bit of `` silent hill '' in there . and i read that this was done by , and or stared a finnish metal band , lordi . so it 's no wonder that it did n't make much sense . it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more . the fx are very good , the look of the movie , the monsters , and even the acting also good . but the story and the telling of it , just are n't there .
this film , the alamo : thirteen days to glory , is utter rubbish . the acting is awful , it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best ( historians would have a field day ) . it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long . rating * out of * * * * * * * * * * .
i 'd give it a 2/10 . i was really , really disappointed . the storyline was poorly developed , for instance , the incidents were too short and brief , hence the moral was not clearly brought out . i thought brenda song did a fine job , but shin koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role . i could see the need to put in western elements in the show , however , there are certain parts , where chinese elements were needed too ! the villain for example . his physical appearance resembled a robot , instead of something out of the chinese culture . the final and the worst flaw , were the incorrect , and distorted facts placed in the show . others may point out that this is a 'kid 's show ' and hence , there is no need for the such high standards . however , there are other disney shows , such as mu lan , which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation . in conclusion , i feel that disney movies should be better researched and better planned . a good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on .
two old men sitting on a park bench . i don ` t really have a problem with this scene - only problem is that it ` s not a scene it ` s the entire movie yup movies don ` t get anymore low concept than this . they also don ` t get anymore boring than this either , but there ` s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . one is nat moyer who is yiddish communist while the other is midge carter a former golden gloves champion who ` s also black . let me see now , a jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . well i guess it ` s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the jewish stereotype ? why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? slightly ironic that the jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of jews seen in nazi propaganda films in the 1930s stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with i ` m not rappaport is that it ` s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it ` s based on a stage play and it shows . walter matthau sleepwalks through his role as nat while this commentator almost slept through the whole movie
this trashy b movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction , but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick . the story revolves around sammy horn ( subtle name ) played by michael des barres . sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife grace ( rosanna arquette ) and a young child . he has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree ( and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting social security ) . the story is centered on a conversation with his therapist ( nastassja kinski ) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback . this is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts , which consumes at least 75 % of the screen time . it is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad . the production values are abysmal . the movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a tv soap opera ( at best ) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone 's garage . the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting , uninspired framing and poor actor direction . the script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar . women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation . as an example , grace 's sister comes over to indignantly inform sammy that she knows he 's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife . his response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her . about three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more . just as they finish grace walks in and sis says to her , ` oh , great to see you , got ta run to pick up timmy ' and mum 's the word about sammy 's indiscretions . the bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment . no spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it . the sex depictions are all overdone , mechanical , and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic . most of them are done with both participants fully clothed . the acting is wretched . michael des barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle . he really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts , but when it comes to actually acting with arquette and kinski , he is adrift . rosanna arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film , giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal . nastassja kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist , but at least we have some acting happening here . the rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like ` hit me harder , is that the best you can do ? ' and ` oh , god yes ' . this movie is among the worst i have ever seen , a dubious distinction given the thousands of films i have viewed . i have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10 . not to be seen within three hours of any meal .
cut to the chase , this is one of the five worst films that i 've ever seen . not that they did n't try . there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there , a good cast , some good acting . i 'm not sure where it went wrong , but it went horribly wrong . some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story , a lot of overacting by the lead ( who probably is much better when restrained ) , some bad directing and editing . i had enough at about an hour , tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran . there was also an insincerity about it all , being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict . he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it . that was bolstered by the pretty 17 year-old girl who was in love with the 30 year-old junkie . and the frantic nature of the lead was a turn-off enough . there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure , but the end result was listless and unending ( with uneven time lines ) . the characters were colorful but to no end , which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you 've just not seen enough . skip it . i assumed that this was a first-time director who was enamored by his own turds , but he has done this before . i 'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money .
this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema , as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry , however it also the worst . how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage . take a look at russia , iran , china and latin america , look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna ! ! get real people , no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema .
i had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying ss new movie on dvd : attack force . now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this . a pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me . i bought this film thinking i 'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up . did i hell . segal is old and bloated , the plot was ludicrous even by ss standards and to cap it all off segal 's acting ( such as it was to start with ) is exceptionally dire . so dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded nothing like him . either ss cant act no more ( a moot point ) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they could n't record the sound properly . the voice would flick back and forth between mr whisper segal and the man who does voice overs for honda adverts ! plot wise is n't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one , nothing new there . the usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away . avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of h5n1 avian flu . utter garbage . 1/10 this has been a public health warning .
my god this movie is awfully boring . i am a big fan of gina gershon , when i rented this movie i expected a romantic drama , and some great performance from gershon . gershon is great as always , but she is not right actress for this role , she is too good for rade serbedzija . the romance between gershon and serbedzija 's characters is too unconvincing . and i absolutely hated serbedzija 's character ( a wonman organizer ) , he is not charming in anyway in the movie . how did dr. lauren graham ( gershon ) is beyond my comprehension . maybe sean connery , robert deniro or harrison ford would have done a better job on this role , but they do n't have the european-ish looking i guess . any way , i was so bored druing the movie . if you are looking for a good gina gershon movie , check out bound , her best film so far . if you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man , try some harrison ford or sean connery movies . gina gershon is so underrated , and she deserves better chance than this , i wish her to make better choice in the future .
this movie was based on actual fact ? i sincerely hope not ! we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso 's . that 's a great idea ; aim for the armor ! ... excuse me , but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud . or were there invisible tanks protecting them ? were they from crypton ? did i miss something here ? this movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out it really takes a turn to boringlane . and that documentary style did n't work for me either , but thats just something one finds likable or not . highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through 'til the end . 3/10 for the fine editing .
1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes ? did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth , in different time frames ( attilla the hun was n't a contemporary of preliterate hellenic cultures , nor were the vikings contemporary to the pyramid builders ) speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english ( except for the inflections they `` do not '' use ) , which has been influenced by latin , ancient greek , danish and french ? 2 cultural differences ca n't be overcome so easily , trust has to be won , yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders . of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods . the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like . 3 historical background : none . visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture , but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part . a small-town theater group probably has better props . 4 boring ! another lame canuck production , which inexplicably ran for ten long years . as a kids show it could make the grade , but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language could n't bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 , like i just did . i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci-fi show , otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes !
now , it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title , so i 'll wait on that . first , this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles . then i realized it , this is a movie with a message , that message is beat kids and things like this wo n't happen . things like what you ask ? things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical `` kill the monster indirectly '' fashion . now , as promised ... blue monkey ... has nothing blue in it nor any simian of any kind . now it snot like i was cheated or anything . the picture on the cover had a giant bug/crab/idiot/thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses . that kinda happened but i wanted apes ! having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few nights before ( half drunk on cask and creame 's brandy mind you ) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80 's style . not so much . if you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you . if you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids , rent this .
dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichés . man and woman fall in love and marry , husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune , woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears . the movie is reminiscent of yash chopra 's chandni and countless others . divya bharti and shah rukh khan give good performances . amrish puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain the music by nadeem shravan is superb , all the songs were brilliant . my favourites are sochenge tumhe pyar or koyi na koyi chahiyye . dewanna is an ordinary movie that goes through the motions .
the majority of stephen king 's short stories are little gems , with original ideas that do n't take a long time to develop ; basically lean and mean -- he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages , you read 'em , and you 're finished before you know you 've begun . they 're like the equivalent of a carton of mcdonald 's fries -- they taste really good and you know there 's not much nutritional value in them ( re : from a literary standpoint , they do n't say much about the universal human condition ) , but you 're still gon na scarf 'em down , just do n't be a pig and go for the extra-super-sized portion and fill up on too much grease ( `` too much grease '' is a metaphor for the prose in king 's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on -- enough with the pop-cultural observations or clever yankee asides -- get on with the story already ! ) he has compiled four books of short story collections . i 've read them all -- from nightshift to the latest , everything 's eventual , and they all display an efficiency of getting-to-the-point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome-sized novels . but his short stories never overstay their welcome ... which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes ... how in the hell did they ( the series ' producers ) get a green-light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ? i 'll tell you how -- two words -- '' stephen king . '' stories with his name on them probably did n't come cheap , and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones , so ... what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length , and double the commercial time ... ka-ching ! i 'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories -- this review supposes you have already read the stories and/or seen the show ; what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented ... of the four installments so far , here 's my ten cent assessment ( from first to worst ) : battleground -- not a classic by any means , but hey , how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog ? and the tongue-in-cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers ( and the writer of the teleplay , who is richard matheson 's son -- the writer of tot ) knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly , yet at the same time , fun . it took longer to get to hurt 's apartment than it should have , but i think it fulfilled it 's objective . 8/10 umney 's last case -- liked this one primarily because of william h. macy 's performance . i think the writer/umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye/umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story , and anyone familiar with the king short story ( probably half , if not more of the audience ) knew the chandleresque set-up was due to get interrupted by the writer 's reality , so let 's get on with it already , and cut-out the cute and clever hard-boiled repartee ' private dick banter already . once the writer/umney 's family tragedy began to reveal though , i thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer ( me , at least ) , feel sympathy for the real-life macy 's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation 's exciting life . 6/10 the end of the whole mess -- uh , this title is how i felt about this episode when it was over . after twenty minutes , i was ready to scream at the tv -- ok , we get it already , the younger brother is a mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire ! we know from ron livingston talking to the camera ( `` time is running out for me '' -- not fast enough , i thought ) that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity -- we know this because he 's already built an airplane but almost died because he could n't steer it out of the path of a tree ; and , he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry ( to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision ) . so much time was wasted on establishing the uber-genius of henry thomas , when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery -- the end of the world through unintended idiocy -- how much do we get to see of the world `` ending ? '' -- a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she 's reporting on , and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand . oh , and the brother 's parents drooling and singing old songs . my point is , if your story is really about the `` end of the whole mess ( world ) '' , i wan na see the `` mess '' as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns . talk about ending with a whimper , indeed . 2/10 crouch end -- this episode just ticked me off totally . i could have lived with the taking-forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel , playing slap-and-tickle , having lunch , and getting a taxi ( that was half the episode right there ) , if once they finally crossed-over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills , but it failed miserabley . not only was n't it scary , it was practically laughable . ooh , look -- a kitty ... wait , it turns ... oh my god ! look at it 's scary eye ! uh-huh . they could have gone a long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight , too . things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows . but i guess the budget was n't high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one . on the page , this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they should n't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there . the only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting -- those were truly horrifying . 1/10 overall series average ( so far ) : 4/10
i went to see this movie ( actually i went to see family portraits , which contains cutting moments + 2 other short films by douglas buck ) at the mar del plata festival ( argentina ) ... i just could n't watch it ! i had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while . by the time it was over , my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed . i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun ( btw , of course i was not the only one who left the room ) . it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me ! i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it . i just do n't get how you can love that kind of movies ! the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days ! ! i also try to analyze the story ( my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it ) and i just do n't think it makes any sense . i mean , that amount of violence and stuff , makes no other sense than to try to shock people . and that 's not a good enough reason , i think . there 's absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say `` well , at least ' x ' thing about it was good '' . but well , i guess i will never understand that kind of films .
i am not one of those people who just go online after i see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made . if you doubt me , please look at my other reviews . however , for the first time ever , i have seen a movie so horrible that i wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over . i love bad movies . to me , ed wood is a genius , i thought bloody murder , jeepers creepers and most horrible horror movies were good . however , there is not a single good thing i can say about this film . the plot is basically non existent . if someone reading my review wastes their money to see it , they can discern for themselves what the plot might be , but i advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie . the special effects are bad . the acting is bad . the two leads are attractive , but that 's all there is . i am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone , but i invite anyone to email me at foxbarking @ yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it . i will tell you anything . i love bad movies , and i love horror and i love new inventive movies . i even love horror porn stuff like hostel ( which some reviewers claimed this was like , but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel 2 ) . but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made . and before you disregard this review , this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead , but actually bought a copy of it .
george p. cosmatos ' `` rambo : first blood part ii '' is pure wish-fulfillment . the united states clearly did n't win the war in vietnam . they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers . the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation , who made this war happen . the character of rambo is perfect to notice this . he is extremely patriotic , bemoans that us-americans did n't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier , but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians . like every film that defends the war ( e.g . `` we were soldiers '' ) also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia . and for that matter also the reason for every single us-american soldier that was there . instead , rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation . it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories , rather than suppressing them . `` do we get to win this time ? '' yes , you do .
i 'm not a big fan of the stooges ' slapstick , but i find their history interesting . i 've recently tried to check out stuff from each stooge era , but the opportunity to see joe shorts does n't seem to come easy ; this is the only one i 've seen so far . some say the quality problems with joe-era shorts are really not joe 's fault , and i suspect that 's the case . joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this . the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment : the pitting of the other guys against the third violates the whole comedy-team/stooges ethos . perhaps joe 's style was perceived , by those in charge , as not really fitting in -- though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him & the others -- and this was their way of working around that . and what 's with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts ? definitely a lack of creativity going on there ; was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market drying up ?
man , this movie sucked big time ! i did n't even manage to see the hole thing ( my girlfriend did though ) . really bad acting , computer animations so bad you just laugh ( woman to werewolf ) , strange clips , the list goes on and on . do n't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie ? and i do n't mean all the naked ladys ... it 's something about the light or something ... this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women , but not because it 's an original movie white a nice plot twist . my final words are : do n't see it ! it 's not worth the time . if you wan na see it because the nakedness there 's lots of better ones to see !
so , where are the cannibals ? those intrigued by the title and the 'real cannibal ' appeal of this film will be let down . instead , we are shown a strange man and his re-visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives , one of whom was his lover several decades prior . the man , tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow , this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes . there are no real cannibals here : only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself . not all together a bad film . very interesting and great cinematography . schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get . it 's just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary . 4 out of 10 , kids .
some might scoff , but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films . this misses out on all fronts . a bunch of young people -- women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t-shirts , naturally -- go to film `` blood surfing '' and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile . not only was the croc obviously fake , but some of the props [ notice the boat hitting the reef in particular ] look like they 've come out of thunderbirds ! no good , from start to finish . do n't see it !
there are so many comments on this film , yet i found them to be misleading . this a corner-cutting , over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason . boy meets girl . girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous . boy is intrigued . you know the drill : the antagonist turns out to be a wild , free spirit instead of a sociopath ... toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love . sheedy 's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug ? ' role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character . and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie .
though the movie may have been `` true '' to lewis 's book ( in that the script was basically word-for-word , verbatim ) , it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this . the mythical creatures ( unicorns , centaurs , griffins , ghouls , ghosts ) are * drawn * in , and as in the previous review , the green-screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow . i nearly laughed to death when i saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth ; i nearly cried when i heard the wolf 's `` howl -- '' a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could . all of the acting is tremendously forced , especially that of little lucy penvensie ... i could only take so much indignation , desperation , and buck teeth in the ( what felt like ) fourteen hours of watching the movie . the actress who plays the white witch , in all her histrionics , seems that she 'd be more at home on stage , where a booming voice , spread arms , and a valiant effort at something shakespearian would be more than welcome . the sets feel claustrophobic , whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors . indoors , it 's as if bbc could only afford to spend $ 100 on constructing a set , and so it is very small , and all the characters are constantly huddled together . the white witch 's castle is a run-down , rotting countryside english castle filled with styrofoam statues and bad lighting . when the penvensie children are wandering through the woods -- actually , * any * scene in the woods -- feels like they are simply wandering around in circles . the only thing that looks decent in the film is aslan , but you can bet that bbc probably blew the film 's entire budget on building the mechanical feline . it looks great when it 's standing still and before it starts speaking , but once it starts moving , you ca n't help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear-end in the lion suit . yes , if you are a hardcore narnia fan , you may want to see this version , simply because it preserves every word that lewis ever wrote -- but lewis was certainly no screenwriter , and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen . during the scene in which the children are at the beavers ' and getting ready to flee from the wolves , mrs. beaver 's incessant , `` oh , just one more thing , dearies , and then we will be ready to go , '' punctuated by the children 's simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of `` no , mrs. beaver , please ! '' -- a scene of comic relief , so incongruous ( they are supposed to be fleeing from imminent danger , not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not ) , detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have . in fact , the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these . i would recommend seeing the new narnia ( disney 2005 ) . the new movie , with updated effects , spectacular computer animation , great timing all around , and a gorgeous and scene- stealing white witch ( who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician , as opposed to a shrieking banshee ) captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of narnia without detracting the least bit from lewis 's original vision ( i think ) . lucy is a lot cuter ( no buck teeth , yay ! ) , as are the beavers ( and realistically-sized ) , and bratty bbc edmund has nothing on the divine , desperately-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and- angsting-with-an-inferiority-complex edmund that the new disney version fronts . unless you 're the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies , i would not recommend this film to anyone .
when setting out this film , director mary harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of bettie page 's career , from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s , and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth . when you think of someone who had page 's career you 'd think that there would be plenty to discuss , her reasons , decisions , life event , personal traumas , but harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character . in the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse , domestic violence and a gang rape , but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again . you get the impression that harron and guinevere turner ( co-writer ) wanted to gloss over anything that was n't glamorous and flattering . you go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was , but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots . all in all the film really frustrates you as you watch , desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself . how did she balance her religion with her job ? what made this young tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography . the film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she 's told , but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation , this was after all the 50s . it seems to me that harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today 's standards ( page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions ) and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous and although this is true , she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others . today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it , but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience . this woman was a central part of a senate hearing on juvenile delinquency , but no one is ever really shown as shocked . basically i left this film just thinking how tame it was . harron and turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer . they come across as two lifelong fans of miss page and are desperate to make sure that nothing , absolutely nothing , could possibly put a bad light on their heroine , and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was . ( before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems ) and all that 's left is the string of events that made up her career , without any substance whatsoever behind it .
after highlander 2 ( which i am still in denial about ) , i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad . i was wrong . i loved the original wargames , however , this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie . the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked . whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor . i doubt he or she even watched the original movie . the acting is n't even convincing . please save yourselves , under no circumstances watch this movie . i do n't care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you ca n't turn the tv off . this movie will ruin your life .
i felt like i was watching the fast and the furious again , but with different actors and a little bit different plot . i will say the cars in the film are very cool . so , if you like fast cars , then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining . i also liked nadia bjorlin because i 've seen her from days of our lives . she is a really good singer , but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie . i mean songs about cars ; not exactly what you would here on the radio . since it is a hollywood film , you have to give this story a little lee way , but in real life i do n't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as nadia bjorlin who can drive a race car , fix a car engine , and be a lead singer . it 's just all very silly . another side note , any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut . but it was kinda of cool at the end when natasha stops right before the finish line and screws michael over . priceless . final verdict : this movie is for car freaks . so , if you like fast cars , then i 'd recommend this .
even by 1942 standards of movie-making the setup which her cardboard lover presents was dated to the extreme . the machinations of one half of a pair ( of husband/wife , ex-husband/ex-wife ) to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another , divorce , or an eventual separation by means of jealousy , humiliation , or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as his girl friday and the philadelphia story . both of these movies features women with a strong , indomitable screen presence and who played independent , proto-feminist characters . in both movies , both women were estranged/divorced from their ( witty ) first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite , and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon-to-be husbands and re-igniting their passion for each other . the plot in her cardboard lover switches the gender : here , it 's norma shearer in the cary grant role out , this time , to ward off an ex-boyfriend ( george sanders ) by means of hiring robert taylor to pose as her gigolo . the problem is , shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid-to-late twenties ; sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most -- any man who would be in love with his fiancée , on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here , would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene . not here . and robert taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel cary grant half the time , not in speech inflections but in overall essence . but the worst part of it is shearer herself . for an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence , playing consuelo craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over-acting , over-emoting , and over-gesturing which , while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier , makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge . it only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives irving thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of ( most of her ) roles ; why she passed on roles such as charlotte vale and mrs. miniver on mega-hits now voyager and mrs. miniver is a mystery , but then again , most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting , that she 'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it 's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and ca n't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible . such could be the case here . she seems lost , she seems tired , she seems ill at ease , going through autopilot instead of living the part . after this film she would make no more , but would be responsible of discovering janet leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s .
first of all , i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes ( cause of the bas screenplay ) . i do n't think this movie has any purpose . it 's boring from the first minute to the last . i do n't understand why this movie scores so high . i gave it 1/10 but actually it 's not more wurth then 0/10 .
simply put , this is the worst movie since `` police academy : mission to moscow '' ( if you liked that movie you will probably like this one ) . what were they thinking ? some ideas should stay just that , an idea . the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense . what was so bad about it i hear you ask . one word ... everything . cost to hire : $ 4.50 cost in time to watch : 89 minutes i want a refund on both !
i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap . the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie . no , it was a hundred times worse . ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that 's not true ; the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director ever . the american cop has a german accent ! the `` police station '' was a desk in a warehouse with a sign `` police station '' hanging on the wall . there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feet . this cop pulls women over , cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse . he tells his cop partner to wait in the car . then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag . the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right , that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women , but he is n't sure if that is what 's happening because - he 's a moron ! the dialog is totally stupid , the acting is awful , and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen . it is totally obvious to the cop 's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it , and yet , the partner , who is there all along , does n't know what is happening ! the director of this film is a total hack . i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i could n't take it anymore . it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i wo n't waste anymore time on it writing this review . absolutely worthless .
the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van , in order to seduce them . the only thing this movie does n't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late 70s . it looks like it was totally made by amateurs . it 's trash , but i loved it ! i have to admit i am a fan of 70s trash ! hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100 ! 2
turgid dialogue , feeble characterization - harvey keitel a judge ? he plays more like an off-duty hitman - and a tension-free plot conspire to make one of the unfunniest films of all time . you feel sorry for the cast as they try to extract comedy from a dire and lifeless script . avoid !
i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wan na kill my self . i do n't wan na live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny . what is wrong with these people . i 'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat . i watched this film in disbelief . who would pay money to make this ? ? this film is so bad that its painful . most bad films are funny because they are crap . the animal is just disgusting ! ! ! watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self . we do n't need you . i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies . if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize .
i was about 7 when this dire monstrosity of a film was released . in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of 1977 for weeks , as if it were some incredible blockbuster film . it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema , and i was put off going for years to come . the following week i was invited to go and see the new film `` star wars '' and i declined . to this day i have never seen it , in protest at having to watch sasquatch ! seriously , even at the age of 7 i could tell that i was watching garbage . it 's just so bad , it 's almost unbelievable . rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema . i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again , just as well as far as i 'm concerned . avoid at all costs ! ! !
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up ? with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers , you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks ' to a corrupt cop . you will never get your 90ish minutes back . life is too precious to rent this movie . i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie . if you like justin timberlake , feel free to rent this movie . he does have a very major part in it , so fans might enjoy seeing him . however , i believe most of his fans are young girls , who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .
stupid , mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes ( piloted by burgess meredith ) chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge , driven by lee majors , with chris makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously , and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . as moronic as it sounds . terrible waste of burgess meredith , but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .
warning : avoid this super duper awful movie ... if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed . pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing ? trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy , just not working at all . pam and denise act so horribly in this movie . plus the script is absolutely atrocious , i ca n't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas . with the development of movie industry , movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century . i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too . stay away from it . i think watch `` white chicks '' from 2004 it 's so much better that this ... make no mistake at that time i thought that 's the worst movie i have ever seen .
the story line has been rehashed a number of times ; `` a breath of life in the retirement home '' . several plays , movies , novels , short stories , poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end , but it 's still an excellent platform for character studies . if 'gideon ' was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant , but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches ( even the subtitle and summary of gideon 's `` simple wisdom '' almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness ) . mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film , but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors ' lack of focus almost irrelevant .
i was true to my regard for mr. glover and ms. goldberg . i watched the entire film with my family and some friends . i have no idea what the movie was about . after much discussion , we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts . it does n't hang together very well . it is too choppy , and there is little comedy . i am disappointed . it could have been much better . i waited months to see this film based on the liner notes . do n't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr. glover 's and ms. goldberg 's films . it was a poor way to spend an evening .
although misty ayers ( burlesque stripper ) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead , this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times ( no nudity in 1954 when this film was made ; not 1965 ) . the guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott & costello . most of the other woman are unattractive , and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way . a 2 out of 10 . ms. ayers has a curvacious physique , but you ca n't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post-dubbed . some of these `` exploitation films '' , usually made later than this one , are interesting in some way , but this is really a bore fest . sid melton ( make room for daddy ) directed . there are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments , but there 's really nothing here .
this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies i 've seen so far on starz on demand . they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crap-fest they can find and put it on here . why ? who knows ! apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv . to be honest , this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailer -- but i did give it a real chance . i always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies . some of the best movies i 've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great . this is not one of those movies . you know the plot by now , i 'm sure , if you 're reading this . either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom . it 's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad `` heavy metal '' music video . whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting , but it really , really does n't . anyway , she kills herself . then she possesses someone . then some killing starts . it 's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible . when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping . was that the best sound effect they could come up with ? i could find a better sound effect to use for free , ( with no copyright , ) on the internet ... right . now . do n't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you . they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying . laughable .
tyson aspect ratio : 1.33:1 sound format : stereo reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer mike tyson . given his conviction on a rape charge , the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain , but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame , the pressures of success , and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad . constrained by time limits , the script gallops through a succession of relevant details , alighting briefly on significant events , culminating with tyson 's ( temporary ) downfall in 1995 . novices will be enlightened by the chronology , while boxing fans will be entertained by director uli edel 's straight-arrow approach to the material . he portrays tyson 's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success . in fact , the script reserves most of its venom for tyson 's ex-wife robin givens , characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety . production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb : michael jai white does a fair imitation of the title character ; george c. scott plays tyson 's mentor cus d'amato through acres of gritted teeth ; and paul winfield was surely born to play don king !
i already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire , there were numerous political and social messages , the names make refer to some other names etc . it might be . i can not realize such things ( i do n't want to do anyway ) because i am not interested in , i am interested in 'cinema ' . as for the movie itself , again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful . i could not see anything which we do n't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half . yes , that scene says somethings about humanity , but it does not make the movie brilliant . the movie is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes , but no more than that . as for the biggest flaw of the movie , it is visual effects . it was just shocking , i could not pull myself together for a while , because i had expected a realistic monster , because it is not one of the old gojira movies , it was made in 2006 , but it was not . it is like if you do n't believe that there is a monster , you can not care about . if you agree with me about this , i highly recommend you cloverfield that is extremely realistic . the design of the monster is not interesting , but at least planned , there is an effort . dramatically powerful critique . some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie . yes , it is rather a drama than a thriller or action , but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful . i do n't want to compare the host with other monster movies , but i try to mean that the host does not do something that other monster movies do not do . by the way , may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for asian cinema . yes , i like asian cinema too , but this is the fact .
well , you might not actually see any women in love in this movie , but you 'll certainly hear women talking about love , and men talking about love , and women talking about men , and men talking about women , and men talking about men , and everyone talking about death , and talking , and talking , until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all , like paint your bedroom or water your plants . welcome to the world of d.h. lawrence , where psycho-babble reigns supreme , and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are . spending time with the characters in a d.h. lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self-absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party . when i read `` women in love , '' i so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it , but since i could n't , i was hoping they would at least strangle each other . alas , only one of them dies , not by strangulation , and i wo n't spoil it for you by telling which one , in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people . to give director ken russell his due , he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it 's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel . he throws out much of the psychological mumbo-jumbo that lawrence adored , and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts , so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields , two buck naked men wrestling by firelight , and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates ( yup , buck naked again ) roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass ( i 'm not kidding ) . glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as gudrun , the more dominant of the two sisters at the story 's focus , and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material ; anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear russell 's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified-looking cattle . oliver reed has one expression , an intense glower . the whole thing is over-written and over-directed , and it 's deliriously campy . indeed , this vies with `` mommie dearest '' as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i 've ever seen . grade : d
so i had low expectations for this movie to start with , but it failed to meet even those . while there were some funny parts , even one or two laugh out loud parts , this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good . the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly , leaving us sitting there going `` wtf just happened ? '' in addition , there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on . the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning . also , the editing was really lacking . there were some poor scene transitions , but that seems to be the style nowadays . it made me laugh , but i would n't watch it again , and i 'm very glad i waited for it to rent . give it a chance , you might enjoy it , but do n't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin , or superbad .
this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd ! ! ! the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on .... but the story line is like a loose cannon . if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.it reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 's , poor script writing and filming . the only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver . the rest of the film , could have easily been made by middle school children . i give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated . my advice-do n't watch it ! ! !
this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time . i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies , but this movie was a disappointment . the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures . when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them . he does n't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents , and unless i missed something the did n't say how he managed to escape either ... not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience . it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the `` cross incident '' .
a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments . i do n't wish to argue with their opinion , but i strongly disagree . when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed . but after comparing it with other films , particularly with the late master , bruce lee i quickly changed my mind . in fact , if it was n't for the title of the film , i would never have bought it . game of death 2 does n't relate to the original game of death , ( except it shares one character , billy lo . ) i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon . the plots have striking similarities : both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative . the two locations are similar , in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of blackbelts . there is an element of prostitution in both films ( women are sent two the guests rooms in both films . ) both han ( enter the dragon ) and lewis 's henchman have a hand missing . their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon , believe it or not , there is one in game of death 2 . han has a pet cat in enter the dragon , the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey ! the list continues . regarding other aspects of the film , such as the script and the acting , i felt it was very poor . it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act . on a positive scale , i can not deny that the choreography is impressive . although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them , they are none the less skillfully performed . however , as the plot is insufficient , i could n't relate to the characters , therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film . in conclusion i would say this film is recommendable to any martial-arts fans , but for those who enjoy a solid action film , with a good storyline and strong characters , i seriously would n't recommend this film . my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one-sided , but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema , particularly after his masterpiece : enter the dragon , this film failed to rise to these standards . if anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial-arts film , in hope of achieving the same level of fame . in reference to my evaluation , awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10 , the film is barley watchable , and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did .
i do n't know what would be so great about this movie . even worse , why should anyone bother seeing this one ? first of all there is no story . one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling ( laughter , cry , fear , ... ) , but in my opinion this movie does not do that either . you are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs . there are more useful things to do . i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above . but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money ? for me the answer is : no .
i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was . first off , the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots . there are no black or gay new yorkers in love ? or who , say , know the self-involved white people in love ? i know it 's not the love crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness but you ca n't pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society . plus , you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham-handed oscar , so where is everyone ? possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters ( remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs ? me either ) . this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst . bad acting , bad writing , bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants . but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion . and , side note , uma dodged a bullet ; ethan hawke looks ravaged . this , of course , is one thing in terms of his looks , but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor , lovely maggie q. i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire , but it has to be the anton yelchin/ olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste , which saddens me because i really like those two actors . i do n't consider myself easily offended , but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone 's 50 year old aunt . a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf 's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie . i do n't mean opposite , i mean against . against is the only explanation . i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight . highlight . please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits , which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world . this film is embarrassing , strangely dated , inarticulate , ineffective , pretentious and , in the end , completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all . ( the extra star is for the cloris leachman/ eli wallach sequence , as it is actually quite sweet , but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless , masturbatory torment . )
ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles . this film is fantastic . vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter . plan 9 from outerspace dons't stand a chance against this . described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a masterpiece- he 's from england and thoroughly sarcastic . it has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her . though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers . and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira . the whole thing is badly done . watch it for the script though
to describe this film as garbage is unfair . at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby . this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining . kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance , so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay . the mad scientist story of 'hollow man ' has been told before , been told better , and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects . most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men , women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies . in the uk they were marketed as 'the transparent man ( /woman/dog ) ' which is maybe where they got the title for this film . clever special effects , dire script , non-existent plot .
i have always liked spike lee 's movies , but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours . i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings . the talking dog was laughable ( you know you 're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately ) . the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting . the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot . i 'm not opposed to sex in movies , but it should have some point ( unless it 's a xxx movie ) . all in all , we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort ! !
basically this is a pale shadow of high fidelity , which was a witty and wonderfully acted film with several truly winning character turns . watching the detectives has none of that . the premise of a video store geek swept off his feet by a quirky mystery woman is a good one but is never fully or adequately explored , thanks to a very weak script and the miscasting of the leads , not to mention the lack of any real visual story-telling style . i mean , this film is centered around movies , yet is itself incredibly uncinematic ! that 's a major failing right there . but the main problem is we simply do n't care about the main characters because the script and the actors ( murphy and liu ) fail to make them true or sympathetic in any real way . so the film just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who seem , well , not terribly interesting . oh , yeah , another thing : for a romantic comedy ? it 's not funny . and the romance is n't terribly romantic , either . so avoid it . even at its 90-something minute running time it 's just not worth sitting through ...
* may contain spoilers * i bent over backwards to be fair to this film . i knew it starred madonna . i knew it lasted a whole week in theaters . i knew it got a lot of bad reviews . i was n't expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class , culture and sexuality like we got in the italian original . the benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes . madonna plays a rich , pretentious , nit-witted gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends ( the brunette woman is as bad as madonna , exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions ) . adriano giannini plays the ship 's first-mate who the madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together . why is she such a bitch to him ? simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson . just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two-thirds of the movie . `` swept away '' is a silly , simplistic , superficial movie from beginning to end . madonna gives a typically wooden performance . there are many dumb scenes : madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of giannini , a fantasy scene with madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt . guy ritchie does his `` stylish '' editing which is laughable here . the film contains some of the worst dialog i 've heard in a major movie in several years . the ending is sappy and implausible . it 's basically `` the blue lagoon '' meets `` overboard '' minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter . maybe madonna 's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress . please give it up , madge , for our sake as well as yours . this is n't her worst movie though . that distinction still belongs to `` shanghai surprise '' . she has n't made anything worse than that ... yet .
this was a painful example of a cheap , boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas . the writing was truly terrible and i 'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally norman . nothing about this tv series was funny - ever - not even mildly amusing . it was just tired and bad and , worst of all , it really thought it was funny . it was simply embarrassing to watch . there is something very suss about this show being given 10 out of 10 on imdb . try to find a ( real ) review by a ( real ) australian viewer of the show ( there were n't many ) and it is impossible . or crazy . there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show . avoid the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd , remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional .
a note to all of you budding film writers : study this film . if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film , please shred your script and try again . i did n't have high expectations , but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory . the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance . i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes , 10 minutes , and at the first break . my spouse , who is the hallmark & lifetime fan , gave up at the first break . forest river is a company town - the main business is aikens ornaments , who make all manner of holiday decorations.the patriarch of the company has recently passed away , so the companies future might be in question . we soon meet noelle , who would rather be on wall street than main street , and the mysterious justin , who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car . once we meet alison aikens , doing due diligence for the board , we have our story setup . if you ca n't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break , you have n't seen enough of this kind of holiday film . maybe that 's a good thing .
the photography on the dvd is so dark i thought the screen had died . i think i missed seeing half of the movie . still , it was poorly crafted and not interesting . i did not find the story related to the title `` the black widow '' . i was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames . i rented the movie especially for willem dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent . i do not believe giada colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture . she is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie . although they are married in real life , they lack chemistry on the screen . their relationships did not seem believable . i do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot .
sadly , it 's true . `` legiunea sträinä '' exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of daneliuc 's irreversible failure . as it was already said , the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form . maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy , he only gathers a disordered pile of events , unable to follow the least story-line . the script 's level is similar to a `` cântarea româniei '' amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only , turned upside down : while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism , now daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology . the ideas content is zero , and the `` message '' , infantile and didactic , at a kindergarten level . unfortunately , he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets . he is n't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation , to order it in a correct movie scene , to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar . his level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like : `` holy sheet man it ai n't nuthin right 'ere , and all da people is asses ! '' what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984 , who had created unique works as `` cursa '' , `` proba de microfon '' , `` vânätoarea de vulpi '' - and even `` croaziera '' and `` glissando '' ... sic transit gloria mundi ...
i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontë 's novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas . but i 'm very disappointed , i never thought it would be as bad as that : the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had . first of all , the music ( and songs ) seems totally out of place in a period drama ( sounds as if it 's been written for a contemporary horror film ) and like another commentator , i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors . i 've seen some scenes filmed that way in `` north and south '' and it seemed all right there but in the tenant , it 's definitely overdone and simply annoying . camera movements can not make wooden acting lively . most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity . none of the characters were properly introduced at first . the little boy gave a very good performance , he 's very cute and the best feature of the film . spoilers tara fitzgerald 's characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh , letting no emotion pass through . she does n't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way . i just could n't believe markham could have fell for her and i 'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given . i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband ! fancy being married to such a virago ... besides , he was the only main actor that sounded right to me . toby stephens i found just ok , helen graham 's brother not very good . maybe it 's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty . besides , what is only hinted at and left to the reader 's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation : making some scenes both gross and comic , ( like when huntingdon 's eye starts bleeding ) and others far too sexed up for a period drama ! i mean , do n't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas ?
disappointing film . performance of actors is weak . sets are fine , could have been better . the story is also weak . battle sequences are awful . sounds and quality of film are trashy . the history of kazakh people was told very poorly . this film should have included more kazakh actors , in leading roles . and also should have been in kazakh language . kuno bekker and jay hernandez are hispanic origins . i do n't get it . since when hispanic people play turkic-mongolian people . this film is shame of kazakh cinema . rustam ibragimbekov disappointed me . he is one of the finest filmmakers in the world . czekh director is excused , since he is not nomadic origin , he can not know true spirit and history of nomads .
the crater lake monster is easily one of the most awful , amateurish film i 've ever seen - ranking right up there with manos , the hands of fate in terms of poor acting , useless direction , and kindergarten-level production values . in this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in bumblebum , ca , and begins dining on the local hayseeds . in the thrilling climax , the creature , described by one local as `` a giant alligator with flippers '' , drags it 's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch , before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom . every character in this moovie is a complete moron . one pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $ 4.75 pint of ripple ; instead of simply buying the bottle , the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander , shoots at a cop , gets chased towards the lake , all so that he can eaten by the monster . unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam . there 's a fake magician struggling with a phony british accent ( to make him seem more legit ) , two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters , some cheesy `` pre-historic cave art '' done in crayon , and annoying banjo-pickin ' background moosic . in one painful scene , the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky , even though it is clearly day time still . even on constant fast-forward , this moovie hurts , and hurts bad . moocow says call the fumigators , 'cause this cow pie really stinks ! : =8p
vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie . vovochka , the main character , is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood . with the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way , he finds changing his mischievous ways hard , yet worthy of doing . personally , i found actor who played vovochka too annoying to sympathize with , however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen . this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre , that 's the little flavor i meant . all in all , i did not really care for this movie , although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience .
this may or may not be the worst movie that steve martin has ever made , but it certainly was far from his best . obviously , he did this crap for the pay check . dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man . what he does n't seem to grasp is that when people go to see a steve martin movie , they expect to be entertained , not bored to tears . it 's sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him . i do n't understand why talented people ca n't get a grip on the fact that people do n't want to see them in lousy movies . if you 're going to call a movie a comedy , then it should be funny . this was n't . shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum , too . full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a `` service comedy . '' surely , phil silvers is rolling over in his grave .
i ca n't say this is the worst film of all time , but only because there are still some movies i have n't seen , yet ! this has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time ! the director suffers from the same issues he had with `` there will be blood '' ( though he was n't quite as bad in that film . the whole movie it feels like you 're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities . it 's like he sits in his little director 's chair and thinks `` how would a great filmmaker handle this scene ? '' he just does n't have it in him . i do n't know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker . there were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished , but nothing was brought to ripen . the scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history . one by one as we see the characters singing , and i squirmed in my seat , i kept saying `` please , please , just do n't have the guy on the brink of death singing , too ! '' sure enough , massive failure !
watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue . it initially looks great but ultimately provides no satisfaction -- none . the plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil . so , how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly ? ! it 's because the picture is all appearance with no substance whatsoever -- much like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career . the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there was n't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade school . the film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on . i really am unsure why it was made in the first place -- it certainly was n't made to provide any sort of entertainment .
in modern day eastern europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken , reluctantly , by melania . she attracts the attentions of an american , seymour , who becomes obsessed with her , paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright . she has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own . however , we are in `` modern art-house cinema '' territory , so conventions like narrative structure , lighting the subject so it can be seen , camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned . much of the time i had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did i care . people began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and i do n't think i 've ever seen so many people walk out . images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen , we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra-red . in fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary ; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness . but perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional . on the whole , almost entirely without merit .
swayze does n't make a very convincing alan quatermain . compared to stewart granger ; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 `` scaramouche '' , the 1952 `` prisoner of zenda '' and the 1950 `` king solomon 's mines '' ; patrick swayze fails utterly . even the portrayal of an older alan quatermain by sean connery in `` league of extraordinary gentlemen '' was very good in an otherwise big flop . also alison doody lacks the grace of deborah kerr in the role of the leading lady , and last but not least the impressive siriaque in the role of umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his ( shoes ) ! ! ! for someone who was disappointed by richard chamberlain 's 1985 version , i now highly recommend it if you ca n't get your hand on the granger version .
it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter , ben gazarra and audrey hepburn . they looked quite wonderful . but that was it . they were not given any characters or good lines to work with . i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing . some of the smaller female roles were fine , patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts . they showed some talent and it is sad they did n't go on to star in more and better films . sadly , i did n't think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role . the film appears to have some fans , and i was very open-minded when i started watching it . i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie , `` cat 's meow '' and all his early ones from `` targets '' to `` nickleodeon '' . so , it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one . it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other . five years later , bogdanovich 's ex-girlfriend , cybil shepherd had a hit television series called `` moonlighting '' stealing the story idea from bogdanovich . of course , there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue , while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines . bottom line : it ai n't no `` paper moon '' and only a very pale version of `` what 's up , doc '' .
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie . i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u ....................................... this movie really waste yours time and money . i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema-hall ...................................................... role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie . i think sanjay-dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi ........................ character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one .this movie show u the result of over-confidence ......... the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing .................. a really very big disappointment
watching this movie was a waste of time . i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie , but i resisted . i do n't know what ridley scott intended , but i learned that in the army , women get as stupid as men . they learn to spit , to insult and to fight in combat , and that 's also a waste of time ( in my opinion ) . and , anyway , what the hell was that final scene in lybia ? are they still fighting gadafi or is it that it 's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger ?
hello . i am paul raddick , a.k.a . panic attack of wtaf , channel 29 in philadelphia . let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler 's film career but was digitized after a short time . going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... or so i thought . sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound . the babes were supposed to be engaged , but , actually , they get executed by sawtooth , the meanest cannibal the world has ever known . adam sandler fared bad in going overboard , but fared better in big daddy , billy madison , and jen leone 's favorite , 50 first dates . man , drew barrymore was one hot chick . spanglish is red hot , going overboard ai n't dooley squat ! end of file .
although twenty minutes of love is a harmless attempt at an early comedy , it was difficult to follow and the film quality was not very good . it does have a couple of moments that are funny , but i have seen better by charlie chaplin .
i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was . i am so glad i did n't pay to see this movie and that i did n't sit in a movie theater for this one . where to begin on this movie , the acting in this movie was average , the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie was n't special . i thought that this movie was suppose to be great , but it was n't more than a cheesy waste of time . i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry , it just was n't there . i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i did n't get the feeling that he was n't acting in this movie . now , alice eve did a great job as an actress but , there was no chemistry between her and jay . all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie . the humor in this movie was not funny at all , there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand . i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he could n't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy . i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials . i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director . the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love story boring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality , but what a letdown nothing . i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie . i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie . so save yourself the agony and just do n't see it .
the only reason i am commenting is because i finally figured out why dr. cox was bald . although we probably all realized it at the same time this week , dr. cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them . the latest episode when our favorite grumpy , jesus-loving nurse roberts dies dr. cox shaves his head . the must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity . for shame , scrubs . they 've made mistakes like this before . i remember when elliot is trying to date scott foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her . i try not to notice these things , but my favorite show needs to step it up .
now please do n't start calling me names like , `` unpatriotic '' , `` weirdo '' and more . the very length of this movie ( 4 hours .. ! ! ! ) is its biggest mistake . no editing at all - seems like j.p. dutta fell in love with his project too much . even lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well . it 's based on true incidents and real people . kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? on top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all . between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff . there were chummy conversations . in the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk . why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near ? and when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place . music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie . better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie . acting was the saving grace : from seasoned veterans like sanjay dutt and ajay devgan , to relative newbies like abhishek bachchan and akshaye khanna , everyone acted like a pro . manoj bajpai and ashutosh rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary . dialogues ranged from brilliant ( `` from madhuri .. with love ! ! '' ) to illogical / monotonous ( `` pakistan se zyada musalman hindusthan mein hain '' ) . and the expletive spree consisting of all the mcs , bcs , cs and f-words was n't really required . loc kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave indian soldiers , but tries too hard and ultimately fails . indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute .
mercifully , there 's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering . the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer . all in all , this show stinks . the story is basically boring , ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it `` ... underrated ... '' the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . you 'll have to catch it on the last show , if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . but , if you can sit through it , you 've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends .
0 * 's christian slater , tara reid , stephen dorff , frank c. turner , mathew walker , will sanderson . directed by uwe boll . based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he does n't succeed . instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made ! even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater , tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line , and some basic relativity of what 's going on in the dark and the light . the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control . and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters . even though they did look cool and the feedings were well , a little lame . honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made . my final rating 0/10 .
yes , in 35 years of film going i have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies i have seen . beating 'good will hunting ' baise moi ' and 'flirt ' for sheer awfulness . this is pretentious blige of the first order ... not even entertaining pretentious bilge . the effects are cheap , and worse - pointless . the script seems to have been written by a first year film student who does n't get out much but wants to appear full of portent ! the acting is simply undescribably bad - tilda swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable 'intensity ' . apparently , some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one ... be warned
there is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer : actress nichole hiltz . she is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge . directed by simon gornick , the film stars joyce hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin ' spouse . oh , but not by conventional means . she plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl nichole hiltz as her weapon of choice . she wants nichole ( as tuesday ) to get close to her ex ( the handsome but dull stephan jenkins , who should stick to music ) to embarrass him and ruin his life . david deluise is good in his few brief moments , and former `` crime story '' star anthony dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl . hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful , then evil and devious . she also handles vulnerable and `` maybe a bit psychotic '' well . she 's also quite hot ( though there 's no naughty bits show ) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at . but the performance is kind of wasted in this movie , which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend .
i had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations ; basically because of kamal hassan . he is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever . but this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . after watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better . the protagonist , raghavan , is a very daring police officer . who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders . raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers , two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students , behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree . finally raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives . these two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters . the murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly , which the movie could have survived without . to even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty . the director , gautham , should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience.certainly i am never going to the movies looking like gautham 's name on the production list .
after reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so . i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth . i agree with most on the point that if it had n't been for lauren lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster . filmed in mariette oh . just north of dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down i-77 years ago , at least as far as a tank of gas would allow . i did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion . this wee tale by the brothers crook is like an old record with a skip in it . as an american i understand the difficulties ind film artists have to face . a trip to romania would have wiped out the budget for sure . lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of claire in the gas station , claire on the side of the road , claire under the bleachers , claire in the house , claire in the cornfield , claire at school . claire here and claire there . it almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast . josh and jeff have to make a living but do n't write a two page script and turn it into an hour , twenty flick . before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of ghost whisperer or something and get a little background . all of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film . also , there is an appearance by co-director jeff as he is in all his films . just like alfred hitchcock , eh ? one thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on lauren lewis ' derrière . well , with all sarcasm now satisfied i still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career ( i hope ) and that chris ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching .
having seen the hot eliza dushku in the pretty good wrong turn , i decided to pick this one up instead of return of the living dead , of all movies . have n't seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say i made the wrong choice . there is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and i am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . it did n't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like i know what you did last summer or valentine or urban legend . it simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . the release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious . the whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect . get wrong turn instead , if you want to see dushku . i would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot elisabeth harnois -- but i do n't think even that would have made this movie watchable . casey affleck , so promising in good will hunting , is awful here -- he seems to lack both intelligence and guts . that 's enough on this one .
this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original , i suppose . which is really sad , because at a deeper level , the title 'vanishing point ' the original , is so ironic . i 'm sure it was n't intended that way , but the original was filmed in 1970 , and released in 1971 . the real 'vanishing point ' was the end of an era , which pretty much ended in the early 1970s . in this remake , all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away , and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience , presumably . `` sanitized for your protection '' inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous , and the idea of a 'noble purpose ' to the trip was subtraction by addition . i 'm glad i watched it however , it made me appreciate the original that much more . the original is a cult classic and golden . this remake is dreadful .
this is your only spoiler warning . what a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered `` oscar worthy '' . i divide material into three levels . the first is the stage theatre . here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and , most importantly , in the power of the writer . a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better . the best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage can not show . the second level is film . in this medium , a weaker writer can be used , but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time . with film , the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing . furthermore , film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal . the final level is literature . in this context , everything is imagined by the author , translated onto paper , and then re-imagined by the reader . far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio . this is why adaptations can go up , but never down . novelizations are never better than the base film ( see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store ) , whereas the film can not convey the same power as the original book ( catch-22 and lotr ) . movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies . as for 'the last picture show ' , it fails . it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right . the characters talk the same and act the same , it 's pure futility . add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film . i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians . the instructor raved about how sad the movie was . what is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious . had this been in color the scenes of impotence , the pool party , and the old hooker would be considered great comedy . look what lucas did with 'american graffiti ' a few years later . the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film . two visually powerful downbeat films : apocalypse now and barry lyndon . rely on them , not this . it 's the 'last ' i want to see of it . 1 out of 5 .
awful , awful , awful . a condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make . once again i 'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they do n't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap . i sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty good .... i wonder if she has seen this ? watch this at your peril , the boredom may kill you .
i liked batman : dead end . a dark edgy film-noir setting for batman was perfect . batman : dead end is good . this is not . first of all let me start off with the acting . none of it is really that good . the best would probably be clark bartram as batman . but that is n't saying much . he is good at first glance , and then you realize he is what he is , a body-builder who happens to be a tolerable actor . but mainly the problem is that batman does n't belong in the daylight , he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit . instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes . the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram 's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman : dead end , probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer . bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting , it 's not , it 's quite the opposite . it 's called posing , something real actors avoid like the plague . something i never understood why collora casted body-builders as the leads . it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it , instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic ! of course , they might have done better if collora 's dialouge did n't leave much to be desired . the entire trailer ( yes , trailer . there will not be a full-length film ) is more centered around superman then batman . but everything on the superman side is corny , cloying and amateur . michael o'hearn ( superman ) is one of the worst actors i 've ever seen . he stands around , smiles , says his lines . that 's about it . although i 'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons . once again i say to collora , cast actors . not bodybuilders . actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they do n't look exactly like the comic book . the costume is what you would expect superman to wear . as for the batman suit . well , i guess it only looks good in the dark . i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop . superman flies in this movie . but that is n't a good thing . these shots look especially amateur . this and a lot of the entire `` film '' looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera . the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands . and the final shot of two-face and batman at the very end . for those of you who have seen the trailer . you know what i 'm talking about . now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer . finally i ask . why if you 're trying to show your ability as a director , would you make a trailer as a short film ? this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story . my only piece of advice for collora here is , there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing . batman : dead end did n't feel amateur . i ca n't figure out where this went wrong .
i 've seen the first of the dwarf-movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it . there are many famous tv/comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented , in fantasy costumes , typical little episodes of their stand-up-program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with . everything was already there .... nothing new to obtain . you 're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb `` jokes '' and you always feel like their goal was to put in every comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage . there 's nothing important about the story : typical fairy-tale story of rumpelstiltskin , without any importance . i expected something like that but that 's nothing i could complain about . i 'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story ; their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they did n't get it anyway . this crap is except the great appearance of helge schneider a total waste of time and money . ( if you do n't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation ) if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that 's broad casted every friday evening on sat1 or rtl for free . i 'm sure you will recognize some `` laugthers '' i saw last night in cinema .
wow what a great premise for a film : set it around a film maker with writer ` s block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who ` s interested in tango . gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes i ` m being sarcastic . it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless you ` re a rabid tango fan ( i do concede they do exist judging by the comments ) or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club ( ? ) there ` s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if you ` re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he ` s seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter
when viewing a movie as silly as 'hot rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one 's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy . with a brief runtime of 88 minutes , this film was long past drawn-out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and were n't even funny in the first place . 'hot rod '' s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 's cult hit 'napoleon dynamite , ' though it 's much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter . in fact , the movie 's blatant desperation to be compared to 'napoleon dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed . the movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , poses a paltry story that puts self-proclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses ( one more than his idol evel knievel jumped , so we 're told by rod ) and raising $ 50,000 dollars for his stepfather 's impending life-saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect because in order to gain one 's respect , one must first fight them . huh ? whatever . each character is no more interesting than rod 's stick-on mustache , and from the film 's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , snl skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minutes , is , essentially , what 'hot rod ' strives to be . the film 's star , andy samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip-drop of his comedic capabilities . unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five-year-old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee-pee gags . and if that 's disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hands , and brace yourself for the real blow : he is the film 's humor ! to rescue them of their mortification , i 'll willingly omit the ghastliness of samberg 's co-stars ' roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team , director akiva schaffer , to his non-existent talent as a director or a comedian . basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash-course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , as though the film would be funnier that way . trick yourself into believing that there 's even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  any other movie .
one of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words ' wan na watch the worst horror movie ever ? ' i always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes . i had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond b . this is z-slasher , the lowest of the low . with obviously low budget , extremely bad acting , bad lightning , no plot , really bad so-called 'special effects ' , shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like house of wax look like oscar-winning masterpieces . the only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits . most of what i said during this film was along the lines of 'wow this is actually so bad ' , 'this is the worst movie ever ' and ' i 'm not drunk enough for this ' . so in conclusion : do n't waste your time ( or money ! ) .
i refused to watch this when it originally aired , treasuring the memory of the late , lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope , but i can never resist a challenge . i should have known better . not quite a remake , and more of a parody than a homage , this show did n't quite know how to play it , and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters . the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors , and only emilia fox could act ( bob mortimer is painful in a straight role ) . the supporting cast were merely comedian-acquaintances of vic and bob 's wanting to be part of the in-joke , and far too aware of the situation to be convincing . and the cgi , though the effects could n't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier , merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work , and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue . all style and no substance . ( and whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time , this 'update ' is now also very dated , with 'matrix'-style fashions , obligatory 'girl power ' scenes , and less than subtle tension between the two living leads . )
like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film , especially the `` film makers were then attacked '' aspect that the case seems to emphasize , what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob . then , to watch the film and discover , oh , what they mean by `` the film makers were attacked '' was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said `` someone should beat those two kids up . '' the picture on the cover , `` the chase '' as it were ? total fabrication . which i guess ties in with the theme of the film , lying and manipulation to satisfy vain , stupid children with more money and time then sense . i have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film . it 's like michael moore 's `` roger & me '' , but if `` roger & me '' was moore mocking the people of flint . it 's completely misdirected and totally inane . wow ! can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food ? what jerks ! and it 's not so much , `` look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah '' , since it was n't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors , it was that , as many people in the film say , the prices were absurdly low , someone mentions that they should 've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck . that 's not proving anything except that people who are poor , will go to a store that has low prices , bravo fellas , way to stick it to the people on the bottom . way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people . you should be very proud . how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then , say , `` haha ! no such house exists ! your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media ! '' . morgan `` please like me '' spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it 's no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him . avoid like the plague .
rented it last night . the opening ( 2001 ) ran waaaaaaaaay too long . the hitchiker scene served no purpose . some skits were just retarded . i knew beforehand , chevy chase was on for less than 2 minutes . no problem . here are the best parts : koko , uranus , babs commercial , curtis mayfield song total : 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell . let me give you some advice : if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies , rent `` kentucky fried movie '' . if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies , rent `` amazon women on the moon '' or `` uhf '' otherwise , do n't bother renting this movie . you 'll save 2-3 dollars . imho : ken shapiro 's best movie is still `` modern problems ''
i 'll be blunt . i 'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who 's not going to take any crap from anyone . if any one of the cast members wanted to , they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat . it was entertaining on mst 3k , but do n't rent the real version . trust me . have i ever lied to you ?
begins better than it ends . funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors . it 's like those scenes where documentary shots ... -- - spoiler part -- -- the message dechifered was contrary to the whole story . it just does not mesh .
the original `` les visiteurs '' was original , hilarious , interesting , balanced and near perfect . lv2 must be a candidate for `` worst first sequel to a really good film '' . in lv2 everyone keeps shouting , when a gag does n't work first it 's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny . lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 , except of course that a parody should be inventive . if you loved lv1 just do n't see this film , just see lv1 again ! !
seriously , the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind . this show is n't funny , it is n't clever , it is n't original , it 's just a steaming pile of bull crap . let me start with the characters . the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud , exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard . the voice acting could 've been better . then there 's the animation . my god , it hurts my eyes just looking at it . everything is too flat , too pointy , too bright , and too candy coated . then there 's the humor , or lack thereof . it 's completely idiotic ! they just take these b-grade jokes that are n't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death . they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me . and finally , last and least , the music . it 's just plain annoying . it sounds like it was composed on a child 's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever . i wish there was a score lower than 1 , i really do . this show seriously needs to be canceled . it 's a show i try to avoid like the plague . whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off . if you 've never watched this show then do n't . watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama .
.. it 's this one ! very cool premise , right off the bat . has an excellent first scene , got ta give credit where credit 's due . has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me : whenever the ghosts appeared , which i really liked by the way ; how it was done , how it looked ... the only thing was the ghost 's relationship . because of the way things went down in the first scene you 'd think their dynamic would be different . things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt , and the crab/spider scene was just not good . but then the ending is actually very good ! sure , 'the grudge ' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai 's and that 's what i liked about this movie comparatively . please , someone one with a tempered style remake this movie . fans of 'silent rage ' would absolutely love this movie .
not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts . * makeup that a child can do . * acting was over done ... poor directing . * editing was very choppy ... many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous . * sound was badly dubbed . * music was highly inappropriate . * casting was extremely off ... must have been on crack . * zombies that talk let alone ... drive , dance , work ... just pisses me off . * and the bad guy ... holy crap ! as horribly casted as he was ... he was the best looking zombie of all . which does n't say much . the cover art was good but very deceiving ... as was the main menu of the dvd ... great artwork and music . don '' t bother !
this movie is not as horrible as most sci-fi channel movies . i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation . however , i had thought that i had seen all the possible lows that the sci-fi channel could hit . then i saw this movie . imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup ? those are the main alien vampires in this movie . you can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets . a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims , and the vampire who is on the vampire hunter 's team can talk to these rubber sock puppets in transylvanian . how did alien vampires learn transylvanian ? and is n't transylvania in romania ? so should n't they be talking romanian ? why would some little town have their own language ? if you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the aliens ' heads ; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires . there are the `` leatherfaces '' who like to wear the faces of their victims . then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars . then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack . finally , if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh , you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves . why does almost every sci-fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying , abrasive , crude , or just totally unsympathetic ? i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win .
in a movie that follows a struggling actor , played , evidently , by a struggling actor , this does no favours for chris klein . he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display , what could only be described as , a bland leading man . the story exists , but that is all , and fails to show any basic start , middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened . one bright light in the midst of this is fred durst , who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life . whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i ' l be watching out for him in future .
daddy 's girls florence lawrence and dorothy west receive some terrific news at the local post office , unaware they are being stalked by burglar charles inslee . meanwhile , father david miles receives a message ( from young robert harron ) which necessitates daddy leaving home ; so , when the young women return , they can be home alone . as the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening , the local `` grand ball of the black and tans '' gets underway ; and , a dark-skinned drinker portends additional danger for d.w. griffith 's dynamic duo mr. inslee has one of his better biograph roles , stealing the film from `` the girls and daddy '' . ironically , director griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras at the `` black and tans '' ball . `` biograph girls '' lawrence and west are suggestive of later `` griffith girls '' lillian and dorothy gish , especially in `` orphans of the storm '' ( 1921 ) ; and , they are excessively affectionate in bed ! the racist tone is unfortunate , since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger , is intriguing . * * * the girls and daddy ( 2/1/09 ) d.w. griffith ~ florence lawrence , dorothy west , charles inslee
this seems like two films : one a dreary , pretentious lengthy saga about an ac-tor who is taken over by the parts he plays ; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress . shelley winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side . she drops heavy hints about the need for connections , her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game . i love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain , and her terrible seducing outfit of navel-revealing , puff-sleeved crochet top . do actors get oscars for shakespeare ? we know they oscars for impersonating disabled people , wearing a lot of prosthetics , or pretending to be mad . the shakespearean scenes ( which go on and on ) are embarrassing and dated . and so are the 'going mad ' scenes where tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over . by the way , anthony john is not aristocratic . he makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy . when he quotes his father 's advice , he slips into a cockney accent .
i do n't buy kung fu movies for a plot . i buy them for fight scenes . a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes , but not the other way around . the story was decent , but moved too slowly for my tastes . there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout , lasting only a couple of minutes apiece . the last fight was a bit longer , but by that point i was so bored i did n't even pay attention to it .
this movie is supposed to be a `` lighthearted '' tale about santa claus and his `` magical and mystical '' wonders . but instead it comes off as being downright creepy . two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are 1 ) the way santa looks.- have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus ? and 2 ) the `` evil rep. of satan '' pitch 's just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch . only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh . i ca n't believe this is a children 's movie .
this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . please do n't watch it
naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task , candidates being so abundant , but nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since i saw it . it was so funny we had to rent it again the next day , and again i laughed so hard i was literally rolling on the floor . ( this usually only happens when i see monty python 's `` scott of the antarctic '' . ) throughout the whole movie , an overwhelming what-the-heck-feeling firmly grasps the viewer . i 'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage . it 's supposed to be a sequel , yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film . the hero has the same name , but this time `` alex '' is female , although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing , what with all the muscles and the barbarian-nomad outfit ! there is really no plot at all , it 's merely a prolonged chase scene , only it 's so slow-paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is . there is almost no dialogue , which is just as well considering the quality of it , and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions , without ever really explaining what it was all about . luckily , it never gets boring , because there 's something silly and phony going on at all times ! terrible movies are usually just tedious , but nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over-seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it 's truly entertaining . rent this film , or buy it even , you wo n't be disappointed !
detective tony rome ( frank sinatra ) returns to the screen after his self titled debut , this time it 's a film that 's played for erm laughs . while on a diving trip , rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea , her feet as you might expect , encased in cement . rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain waldo gronsky . rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types , who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect , he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone . the portly sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective , oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy raquel welch , but he fails miserably , in this ham fisted vanity project . the frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding , every woman in the film is a dither head , who likes bending over is front of the camera , director douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles . there 's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief , this was a film made by `` real men '' for `` real men '' to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality , it 's a shameful shambles .
from the opening dialog and scenes , i knew i knew i was in for a train wreck . did n't want to look , but could n't turn away . if it were n't for the meer eye candy of this film , i would have given one star . the fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched , added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster . money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film . but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound . if you were stuck out in the woods , your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease , other friends dying around you , stranded in a strange place , what would you do ? a . ) run away from everyone and try your luck on your own . b . ) have sex with your friends girlfriend . c. ) take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs . d. ) bash in the head your childhood best friend and life-long crush with a shovel . e. ) all of the above . according to eli roth , none of these answers are that far fetched . in fact , all are plausible and well represented in cabin fever . the total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store . stay away . stay far away .
what ? ! ? ? why are people saying this is `` mind blowing ? '' just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography ! 4 left and the whole world has ended ! not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed . 1 was right the whole time , if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened . people giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what ? ... to make it rain ? i admit the movie had it 's parts , and the whole concept was fascinating . but a lot of it was clichés one after another . and did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like `` lord of the rings ? '' characters died for stupid reasons , there was almost no character development , and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world ; its pointless and stupid . it was one of the shortest movies i 've ever seen , and thank god ! how is robots turning against humans creative in any way ! it 's been done like a hundred times ! this movie is really stupid , go see a movie that 's worth watching like star trek , the hangover , or inglorious basterds , those were good movies !
the premise of the movie has been explained and if you 've gotten this far you do n't me to pretend that i 'm a movie critic . with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low . i 'm a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 , and some others ( many ) . the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong . this is a highschoolers approach to cinema . for the rest of us we 'll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying ( and yes , this does take away from the film ) , the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis , and the acting ... well ... hmmm . if one is a takashi fan you 'll see it regardless to peak your interests . it lacks any originality ( see the neverending story ) or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one . as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co-writing , but that does n't mean much as non of what we 'd hope would be miike 's personality would spill over into the screen . all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography . the movie had the potential to be something great . the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with . but this one seemed to have been run into the ground . my suggestion is if you 're just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu , ichi , and audition . then movie into his works like blue 's harp , fudoh , rainy dog , bird people of china .
please note : i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky . considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind . although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . the lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms. brooks could do a french film . this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent-style acting . the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . for a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means `` old '' -- not `` slutty '' ) . a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . she gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! a tad melodramatic , huh ? and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped . finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) i found very disturbing and unreal . he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited . were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? this seems to me that 's what is implied and i do n't like it at all . there are far better french films of the era ( le million , la femme du boulanger , fanny , regain , and others ) as well as better silent films . i just ca n't understand this film 's high rating .
let 's see . in the `` st . elsewhere '' finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child . `` newhart '' ended by telling us that it had all been a dream . and `` roseanne '' ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind . very `` creative '' . annoying was more like it . yes , it was just a tv show and was n't at all reality . it 's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it 's all `` real '' . at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen . this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat , frustrating and simply not fun to watch . now `` newhart '' being all a dream ? at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show . the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever . roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan .
now , i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it . he is an excellent actor , brilliant in everything ... except this movie . and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was , and did n't bother with a good performance . this movie is a unintentional-comedy . some of the lines just crack me up . and them there are some lines that make no sense , and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot . oh ! btw the plot is bad ! but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch . i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans , or fans of any of the other actors , because the plot is pathetic .
over the past year , uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker , cranking out the competent `` in the name of the king '' ( a `` lord of the rings '' clone ) and the proudly vulgar , post-9/11 satire `` postal . '' but then came `` seed , '' and the counter was reset to zero , keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach . and i 'm a fan of the guyhis films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision , and are never dull . spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received , `` seed '' is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary , and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology ( boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombie 's successful reboot of `` halloween '' ) . the antagonist is maxwell seed ( will sanderson ) , a mute , hulking brute who 's slain 666 people and sits on death row , awaiting execution ; after unsuccessfully frying the beast , he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there ... and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem . trying to create a new-millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees , max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression , ultimately resembling a washed-up pro wrestler doing `` the toolbox murders '' on a succession of equally boring victims . furthermore , seed 's character and boll 's `` message '' run contrary to one another : the death penalty is wrong , sure , but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who 's left a couple hundred corpses in his wake ? i think not . meanwhile , michael pare acts like a listless , long-lost brother to james remar 's character on `` dexter '' : a cop who sits at his desk a lot , thumbing through newspaper clippings , and watching pointless stop-motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seed 's lair . by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seed 's hideout , the sequence is so drawn-out , ill-conceived ( the lighting is almost non-existent ) , and unexciting ( despite a healthy dose of gore ) that it almost put me to sleep . the shoddy film-making is n't limited to just that sequence : `` seed '' appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer , since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly , a technique that 's more stomach-turning than the gore itself ; these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering , almost non-existent narrative . at 90 minutes , the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture , which might have been boll 's intent all along . pure genius ... i guess the joke 's on me .
i read that `` there 's a girl in my soup '' came out during peter sellers 's low period . watching the movie , i 'm not surprised . almost nothing happens in the movie . seemingly , the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie ; it does n't . the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything . maybe i have n't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies , but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name . all in all , both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this , so do n't waste your time on this . pretty worthless .
charles bronson continued his 80 's slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade , if not ever . in it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder . it 's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made . a lot of people consider the death wish sequels to be bronson 's worst movies . the death wish sequels were n't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable . kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation . it really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a `` law and justice '' mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything . indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo . the chicago theater i watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene , only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film . it has no point other than to exploit and really the movie was n't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work . bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save . i want to point out that i think charles bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst . the action sequences are poor also . 1/2 * out of 4- ( awful )
the priyadarshan/paresh rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of hera pheri and hungama so i went into the movie ( at an indian multiplex ) with high hopes , especially after the slick promos . unfortunately , like hulchul before it , this movie was a huge disappointment . like others have commented , the premise of the movie , which was already stale to begin with , just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering . after a while , you just want the movie to end so you can go home ( if i had been watching this at home , it would have been much easier to cut my losses ) . akshay kumar 's performance is average at best and john abraham should not try doing comedy again . the comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week . i only remember giggling like twice the entire movie . definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in hera pheri or even to a lesser extent in awara paagal deewana . paresh rawal had a few of his expected classic moments , but overall , because his role and character was n't given much room to grow , he did n't make much of an impact in this film . neha dhupia , who makes only an appearance in the movie , was fun to look at while she was on screen . and some of the songs are fun . especially the opening and closing songs of ada and kiss me baby , respectively . otherwise , you 're better off just passing on this movie .
this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed . the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made . being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money . i rented it so i wo n't complain too much about what i paid , but it was a couple hours that i 'll never get back . plot holes abound . terrible acting all across the board . i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie , life is too short . if your friends want to watch this , run away . i ca n't stress enough how bad this film was . where the hell did the second dragon come from ? why did n't he show up sooner ? how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago ?
the `` math '' aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows . the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow , although his career must have been ( undeservedly ) waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock . the lame-ness of the `` math '' aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring lou diamond phillips ( which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned . ) in order to catch a fugitive , the `` mathematician '' uses some theory about `` bubbles '' . so , he gives this long explanation that , if we have seen the suspect in places a , b and c , then we can use `` bubble theory '' to calculate where he might be . he does this all on a chalkboard , or maybe with a stick in the dirt ( i cant remember ) . anyway , when you look at the finished product , he basically took three spots , and picked a point right in the middle and said `` ok , mathematically , here 's where we are most likely to find the fugitive . '' at which point , one other character points out `` oh , that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live . '' is that math ? its not even connect-the-f * * k * * g-dots ! ! ! this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to `` support '' points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense . it just goes to show -- when you 're a hammer , everything looks like a nail . i ca n't wait til they stick the numb3rs team on osama ... they 'll use calculus , call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains , and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... cuz hey ... its all about the numbers . totally ludicrous tv show .
all the other comments already said what i was going to say , here goes anyway . i thought this was italian at first , sorry about that , italy . i was n't bored because i kept waiting for something to happen . who did that song about dr. tarr and professor feather way back when ? was it alan parsons ? saw this on a brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected , terrible . full of streaks and stuff . the movie was an incoherent mess . goofy music and clueless characters . the main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients . i thought the `` doctor '' directing the `` battle '' scene was never going to end . had some good looking babes though . it seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked . i gave it a 2 for the nekkid women . that bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs . poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his .
what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there ? this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view . can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee ? fontaine looked more like her mother . even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film . piper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in `` the hustler , '' have no scenes together in this film . laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there , despite the fact that she is married . woe to her when her husband comes back from the war . jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman . there is even romance for the young miss dee here . the picture has little to no meaning . are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war ? if they are , they did a poor job in selling this . the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of . that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957 .
the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium , are fine : you see real chaos on the set , a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown , the cool has been-director ( mickey rourke ) , the bad tempered star , etc . you have seen everything before , but it 's well done . but then ! the rest of the time the film just repeats itself : the same ten minutes over and over again . no climax , no dramatic development , no good acting , not even bad acting , it just goes on and on and on . mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f * * ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet . altogether , that makes 12 good minutes .
snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . the plot is pretty much foreseeable , the characters are stereotypes , the editing too exaggerated . anyway , the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions . instead , i think this is a straight commercial thing . including a character from the french part of switzerland ( the actor is the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band 's called sens unik ) seems to aim to a larger audience . a straight german-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa . what really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie . sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips ! i also think the topic of `` young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives '' is a wide spread reality in zurich . therefore , it should be elaborated with more care . i hope samir got enough money with snow white , in order that his next movie is gon na show his true artistic skills .
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the screen 's most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin . larry peerce 's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy . robert klein certainly think it 's the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film . normally , i do n't like to let myself get so ascerbic , but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite books , and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .
this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen ! some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor . this nail trap catches these bad guys . the rest of the movie degrades as you go . i ca n't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time . i also ca n't believe that there are sequels ! the next crap movie that i want to watch is r.o.t.o.r . could r.o.t.o.r really be much worse than this ?
lame plot and two-dimensional script made characters look like cardboard cut-outs . needless to say , this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters , especially the fiancé ; he looked and acted more like a cartoon . in summary , i guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for tv drama . it uses just about every cliché in the book . the tortured classical musician who wants to break-out and play salsa . the free-spirited fiancée engaged to a `` bean counter '' personality she does n't love . i wo n't list them or else it would be a spoiler because i 'd be giving away the whole plot . the dancing was ok but nothing special . i 've seen worse . 3 stars for good music . the band was really tight . i saw it on youtube . thankfully i did n't pay good money to see it at a theater . i 'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews this movie has garnished .
1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 ( dir-arne glimcher ) : mystery ? ? /thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists . despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it 's audience . the movie-going public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with . we think that this movie is going to be about something with connery 's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard , contrived for the audience 's sake , run of the mill , let 's never get it over with , thriller . we are pulled into every silly switch in character , as they are portrayed to us when it 's needed in the story , and we 're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends . yes there is some good acting here , especially from blair underwood , fishburne , and ed harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end .
this film had no huge stars in it , but did have a very good cast filled with excellent supporting actors and gene tierney before she became a big star . with george sanders , reginald gardner , harry carey , bruce cabot , jospeh calleia and cederic hardwicke , you 'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered . most of this , i suspect , is because of a second-rate script , as director henry hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm . the film is set in east africa during wwii -- just before the americans entered the war . the brits are trying to control their african colonies while subversive nazi elements are trying to stir up trouble among the locals . one of the white men in the film is a double-dealer -- working for the destruction of the british empire ! but , lovely tierney , playing a sultan 's daughter ( ! ) , is out to help save the day for good ol ' britain . american film makers have long sided with the empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire films . nowadays , with changed sensibilities , the notion of seeing the happy black natives dying for queen and country seems ridiculous -- and it would be hard to root for either side ! still , in its day , this propaganda piece was effective in drumming up support for the british -- though when seen today , the film suffers from a long-winded script and silly casting . the one bright moment in the film is the final showdown between george sanders and the enemy agent . too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk -- losing some of its punch .
this is high grade cheese fare of b movie kung fu flicks . bruce `` wannabe '' lee is played by bruce li ... i think . of course , let 's show quick clips of bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice , it kind of looks like bruce . you 'll laugh in awe at how the film splicing is n't very good , but some cool deleted scenes from enter the dragon are thrown in the mix . according to the movie , bruce lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter . of course , they think this can excuse bruce li for trying to be bruce even though his character is supposed to be bruce 's brother ( who for some reason still mimes bruce 's gestures and fighting style - very poorly ) . see bruce go one-on-one with the cowardly lion . the props department stopped by kay-bee , you see . bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man . towards the end , the director decided `` let 's throw a flashback '' for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago ! ! they must 've thought that only one-celled organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film .
i think it 's a great movie ! ! it 's fun , maybe a little unrealistic , but fun and dramatic ! ! i would like to see it again , if they were showing it in tv ! ! just 1 question : are we still talking about the same movie ? ? ?
i can hardly believe that this inert , turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works i 've quite enjoyed . the experience of enduring the lady and the duke ( and no other word but `` enduring '' will do ) , left me in a vile mood , a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali-112 . for not only has rohmer attempted ( with success ) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but , as ali has pointed out , has shown ( at the cost of alienating his audience ) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times . the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult , but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor .
greenaway 's films pose as clever , erudite and innovative . yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the world war 1 era of film-making : the frame composition , use of mid-shot , the static camera . it may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new . perhaps like that other `` innovator '' , ts eliot , he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could . yet greenaway 's biggest failing is that he can not write . his dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician , brecht . where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor , which is poised and logical , so the joke is dead before it 's delivered . the result is tedium : if it 's not funny , it has failed : ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience does n't respond . perhaps the well-read director could learn something from freud on humor . finally , like woody allen , greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones . they speak the lines with a bored , smug air like narcissistic adolescents . this film , despite its design and lighting , is meretricious .
i registered for imdb just to comment on this movie . i just got done sitting through this movie , and the only thing that impressed me , was that i somehow had the will power to not stop it . i 've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not , but princess blade has some of the worst fights i 've ever seen in a movie . most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent is n't doing the same . i 've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots . so now we have a `` futuristic '' action movie with poor action , and virtually no sign of the future . most of the movie does n't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister . the movie has multiple plot lines , and none of them really pan out to be worth anything . part of the problem may have been that i watched the dub , which was quite bad . the entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on . but i got the general idea . ( knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes ) if you 've heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick , then you 've heard wrong . thats what i thought it was when i heard about it , and now i 've lost 90 minutes of my life . do n't let this happen to you . steer well clear of it .
do n't get me wrong , the movie is beautiful , the shots are stunning , and the material is dramatic . however , it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done . bbc 's planet earth was all of the above and more . it was subtle . it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death . there was tragedy and triumph , loss and gain . it was balanced . disney 's edit of earth is none of this . they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about . they made it dramatic . they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us . they made predators evil . they made walruses evil . they showed every encounter as negative . it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded , but at the expense of the lesson of balance . the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive . i am all for preventing global warning , but this was over the top political and environmental junk . that 's another thing , i went to see it on the big screen , but was disappointed in the picture quality . it looked better on my tv at home . if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture , go out and buy , rent , or borrow the bbc 's planet earth series . it is better lessons , better sound , and ( if you have blu-ray ) better picture quality .
i wo n't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as i 'm concerned it is n't really a movie to start with , just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a `` boogeyman '' sequel . literally 80 % of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor `` the boogeyman '' , a film that the writers of this garbage apparently did n't even bother to watch because they could n't even get actress suzanna love 's original character 's name ( lacy ) right . and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage , apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are . 0 out of 10 and i wish imdb 's rating system went that low , the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off people 's money i 've even seen , you have been warned !
note to horror fans : the only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that 's so worthless it 's insulting . i watched this because : the premise sounded slightly promising : it 's not . it 's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that were n't good either . the promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful : it 's not . it 's so not . the amateur cinematography makes sure the `` fallen angels '' are about as sexy as the average homeless person . the name tom savini has a long history in the horror genre : he 's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting . come to think of it , savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie . it 's not that he 's bad , but he 's almost always in bad movies . his only good role was in from dusk till dawn , and he 's been milking that at horror conventions ever since . but let 's focus on the positive : forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie . everything else is a negative . obviously the writer is allergic to originality . the script is terrible . that 's all a given after the first 10 minutes . but the clueless pacing ; the way the director treats `` plot '' and `` characterization '' as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway ; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving , walking , and nature sequences ( no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution ) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general . this is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad : if it 's written and directed by the same person , expect garbage .
let me first state that i enjoy watching `` bad '' movies . it 's funny how some of these films leave more of a lasting impression than the truly superb ones . this film is bad in a disturbingly malicious way . this vehicle for sam mraovich 's delusional ego does n't just border on talentless ineptitude , it has redefined the very meaning of the words . this should forever be the barometer for bad movies . sort of the mendoza line for film . mr. mraovich writes , directs , and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben `` dead behind the eyes '' sheets struggle for marital equality . as a libertarian i believe gays should have a right to get married . ben & arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes . the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham-fisted , trademark mraovich , that you ca n't possibly take any of them seriously . arthur 's brother victor , the bible toting jesus freak , is so horribly over-the-top evil/effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role . that 's because sam `` multitasking '' mraovich was also casting director . the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself . when you think leading man do the words pasty , balding , and chubby come to mind ? sam also delivers lines like domino 's pizza , cold and usually wrong . the final tally : you suck at writing , directing , acting and casting . that 's the ed wood quadruple crown . congratulations you horrible little man .
i absolutely adore the 'toxic avenger ' series , but this weak offering by the troma people did n't make any sense , and it had me yawning all the time . a leaking nuclear plant ( and the growing weed next to it ) makes the youngsters of tromaville high go nuts , which causes them to join a gang , have sex , explode , and whatever . also there 's some sort of monster breeding in the high school ... my god , this movie 's a mess . the actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should . the ( intended ) overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... disappointing . 2/10 .
as with most of the reviewers , i saw this on starz ! ondemand . after watching the preview with my girlfriend , she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched . i , on the other hand , thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching . i mean , the design of dr. meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title . after watching it , i can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it ( namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story ) , it 's best to pass over this one . * major spoilers ahead * after making their first video for their as-yet-unfinished cd , the lead singer , cassidy , kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend neil to notice her . 3 months later , the band is trying to decide if they 're going to finish the album or not . to try and see what cassidy would have wanted , they go to see an old psychic friend of hers , dr. meso , and try to contact her through him . in his card reading , dr. meso turns up four straight death cards for the four remaining band members . bad times are ahead . ( i just wanted to make a point that later in the film , they do explain that the death card really just represents change . kudos to them on that at least . ) even without the approval of their deceased friend , they decide to go ahead and finish the album . but while in the bathroom , cassidy 's best-friend , dora , catches a glimpse of her deceased friend . when another band-mate goes in to check on her , dora is standing in the dark , requesting his sunglasses . that 's when the killing begins . my main problem with the film from the very get-go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault . too many warping effects , unnecessary zooms , and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film . an incoherent storyline does n't help anything either . while the narrative hangs together for the first part , once cassidy is resurrected , everything falls apart . we have jump-cuts between cassidy and dr. meso ( who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building ) , which show they are connected in some way or another . however , within a few minutes of that revelation , we find that cassidy really is an independent being from meso . she then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind jack nicholson as the joker . but not in a good way . from this point on , the whereabouts of cassidy are shown , but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence . one scene we see cassidy standing at a desk , when a character enters in the next , she 's nowhere to be found . as he moves behind the desk , we see her at the end of a hallway . then in another room grabbing the keys ( which neil already has ) , then back again . not to mention that from one moment to the next , cassidy 's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it . one moment , she wants to kill everyone ( although she 's only wounded 90 % of the characters ) - the next she 's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again . sound confusing ? that 's because it is . it 's a jumbled mess that i 'm sure the writer could n't even figure out . as for the performances , most are particularly wooden . some though are interesting , but overall this is n't a piece that would be known for it 's acting . the story is the driving force behind this piece .
there have been so many many films based on the same theme . single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex , pays him and then ( guess what ? ) she falls in love with him , there 's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending ...... this has been done many times . the thing is i knew this before starting to watch . but , despite this , i was still looking forward to it . in the right hands , with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours . this was none of these . this was dire . a female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me . i truly did not care if she `` got her man '' or remained single and unhappy . a male lead who , after a few of his endless words of wisdom , i wanted to kill . just to remove that smug look . i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing all-knowing enlightenment . a totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters . none of them seemed to have jobs , all of them had more money than sense , a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend .... plus `` i would miss you even if we had never met '' ! ! ! ! ! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross ..... i could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name `` woody '' but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film .
the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one . there are a few things that derail this film . first , tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals . in my opinion , any footwear on tarzan , whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed , takes away from the character , which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle . second , the character of benji , as mentioned in a previous post , totally derails the movie as the comic foil . to me , his character is unnecessary to the film 's plot . also , while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan , it 's apparent that he was not in his best shape . although in his later jungle jim movies , his physique had improved somewhat from this film . the octopus battle is a terrific idea , but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak . likewise , the battle , which takes only 30 seconds tops , would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate . and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye , it does n't manage to salvage this last weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run .
an avent-garde nightmarish , extremely low-budget `` film '' that has delusions of grandeur . hard to sit through . i get the message that child abuse is wrong . wow big revelation . i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this . yes that 's sarcasm . do n't watch this `` film '' if you 're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender . do n't watch it if you 're the least bit squeamish . do n't watch it if you care about acting . on second thought just do n't watch it period . my grade : d- dvd extras : making the movie , the premiere , interview with kristie bowersock , deleted scenes , movie stills , director 's commentary , 2 versions of the teaser trailer , music video by the azoic , & a classroom video experiment
christ , oh christ ... one watches stunned , incredulous , and possibly deranged , as this tawdry exercise in mirthless smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a palsied galapagos tortoise . can such things be ? does this movie actually exist , or was i the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international drugs company , sipping my coffee unaware that it had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen ? i 've seen a lot of films , and a lot of bad films , but nothing prepared me for this ; by the end of it i was a gibbering , snivelling wreck , tearing at the carpet with my teeth like a dog , clawing at the walls , howling till my lungs were sore . i pleaded desperately , frenziedly for mercy ( to whom this appeal was made , i do n't know ) , and longed with burning desire for the soothing balm of ozu yasujiro . sweet weeping jesus , the memories ... sometimes they come back to me . when i 'm at my most vulnerable , when i 'm least able to handle them . i shudder , i break down in tears , i bite my fingernails till my hands are slathered with blood , but i ca n't quite banish the awful flashbacks from my mind . i 'm haunted . i 'm damaged . i 'm a shell of a man . the other user comments here suggest that i am not alone in having undergone this terrifying experience , which can only mean one of two things : a ) the film does , in fact , exist , or b ) i am but one victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions . what is quite mind-boggling is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal , or at least have not been left traumatised by it . perhaps they 're part of the operation . god damn them , the maniacs ! god damn them all to hell ! ! ! ! ! !
i have to admit that i stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen , besides the dead body in the first scenes ... and her disposal of him . i was wrong . it was a cinema verite of betty hits the beach encased for the first part by mordant morven . i really do n't care what young lassies from scotland do these days , who thy screw , what drugs they take . visually , the stroll through the cabo de gata in andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me . the nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend . as the movie came to a close i had two thoughts ... 1 . that 's all there is ? 2 . now i see why her boyfriend killed himself . rename it . `` bare bitch boredom , or what i did on my trip to spain . '' i 'm such a sucker for sticking these things out .
the cover art ( which features a man holding a scary pellet gun ) would make it seem as if it 's a martial arts film . ( hardly . ) i find it interesting that the film 's real title is trojan warrior . ( trojan is a brand of condoms in the us ) this movie is loaded with homoeroticism . if you like that stuff , then this film is n't that bad really . however , consider these points : there are numerous close-ups of actors ' groins & butts , ( one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants . ) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime , peach , and red . from a cinematographer 's standpoint , this movie 's a drag queen ! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another , occasionally touching as they converse . also , the cousin of the hero likes women , and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him . is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ? shall i go into the fight scenes ? ( yes , someone 's private parts get grabbed in one fight . ) the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative . no fancy stuff here , just your standard moves you 'd see in an old chuck norris flick . there 's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film .
this film is so bad i ca n't believe it was actually shot . people who voted 10 or 9 , 8 and even 7 , are you insane ? did we really watch the same movie ? or the same sh * * should i say . everything is bad in this film . the story ( is there a story ? ) is going nowhere , completely incoherent , the acting ( some dialogs are simply just ridiculous ) , the music score ( what the * * * * is that ? ) , the editing , and especially the artistic direction , a pure disaster . reminds me the old macist movies ... to give you an example of the amateurism of the production , the mermaid 's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it . i 'm not joking , that 's exactly what it is . another example of the enormous mistakes we find here : you see in a scene an extra , a fat woman of about 200 pounds , who 's talking on her cell phone . the next shot , which is in a complete different location , you can see this same woman , still talking on her cell phone ( ! ) yes , it goes that far . a big , huge , waste of money . useless .
ho-hum . an inventor 's ( horst buchholz ) deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands . unknowingly his son ( luke perry ) has been working on the antedote all along . enter cia agent olivia d'abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins . also in the cast are : tom conti , hendrick haese and an aging roger moore . moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts . perry fans will be accepting . d'abo is wrong for the role , but nice to look at .
whoa nelly ! i 've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing . man was he right on the nose ! this movie was acted by pure amateurs . they had to have done one take , maybe two on each scene , the movie seemed soooo rushed . the script was also poor .... they had lines that tried to be unique but failed . miserably . `` get your meathooks off of me ! '' oh man , i hate it when movies try to do that . it happens all the time with comedies ... but , with a horror movie and with below average actors .... the results are incredibly pathetic . the lines and scenarios were all very predictable . but what made me feel so negative towards this movie was , again , the damn acting . it was awful . besides by the little asian guy who worked the booth . i thought he was great . the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh ! t tourist who are on a vacation in asia . they end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex/slaughterhouse . sounds like a cool story . but watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch . the only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing . there was n't a trace of suspense . i like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this . but unfortunately with a huge capital u , the movie was incredibly disappointing . i did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects . the flabby chicks were also so so . everything about this movie screams amateur . this is ryan nicholson 's first feature length , and for the most part he failed . there 's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror . i pray his next movie does n't play out like another b horror flick ... unless he tells us that 's what it 's gon na be . even after this disappointment i 'm willing to give ryan another shot . from what i 've seen of him , he 's a true , dedicated man to the genre . good luck next time , because this was bad news .
i had the ( mis ) fortune to see this film at a showing in the us . having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing , i am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on imdb . the original film was a turkey , but an interesting one . it fitted into that early seventies , post 1969 revolution thing ; this film just stinks of ....... , well , nothing really . it 's that bad . imagine a badly done perfume commercial - see what i mean ? madonna never could act , and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years . she looks worse and worse with every one of those years , increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat . guy ritchie , who has built his `` reputation '' on lock stock , could never direct either - his movies are shallow , badly cut , fashion shows . he does n't disappoint here either ; he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle . please people , take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below . they are quite obviously business plants . do n't encourage ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money .
this movie was astonishing . it is beyond atrocious . i often get together with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find awful movies to watch for their comedic value . my friend suggested this one , but as we watched it , people began to leave . i really wanted to finish it , just so that i could say that i had , but i was unable to . it 's that bad . horrible running gags , lame acting . the main characters are an annoying dinosaur klutz and whoopi goldberg . i would rather watch costener 's the postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again . i think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues , but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with his tail , and then guffawing about it . it hurts . watch it if you 're an aspiring masochist , otherwise , leave this one alone .
yes , mtv there really is a way to market daria . what started as a clever teenage angst- '' comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life '' sitcom now mutated into a `` how you should deal with your problems '' -charade . i used to watch daria all the time and loved it . now , sitting here after watching the so called `` movie '' i can only wonder what the point of this all was . daria tells us how to lead out life in college ? excuse me ? did n't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok , as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it ? this entire thing reminded me of the scene in `` reality bites '' the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time .
the mummy 's tomb starts with a review of the events in the mummy 's hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past . while i absolutely loved `` the mummy '' with boris karloff as the mummy imhotep , and quite liked `` the mummy 's hand '' with tom tyler as kharis ( which is the direct prequel to this film ) , i was not as taken with `` the mummy 's tomb '' . it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting . lon chaney jr is okay as kharis , but does n't really stand out . and i guess that 's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out . there 's nothing really terrible here , but nothing really outstanding either , so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy 's tale .
i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts . the true test is whether it is good from start to finish , which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review . most of us would agree -- even those like me , who enjoy reading many blogs -- that blogs ca n't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons . likewise , fem ca n't compare with good film making for a number of reasons , and i actually believe it 's a poor example of independent filmography . from start to finish , fem feels like a pieced together vlog . ( heck , even myspace gets some pimping . ) if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15 -- i do n't -- i 'd go watch it . fem , while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media , is so personal that it is without an interesting story . it 's like watching the mundaneness of life , which i think most would agree is very naturally boring . and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it , their very postmodern film about making a film . cue my yawn . ultimately , i come away not caring the least bit about any of it . i 'm shocked that i 'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review , even . it 's not that fem is downright bad , because it is n't ; it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe -- just maybe -- something of interest is about to happen . it 's rather that it 's just downright ... mediocre . i feel so indifferent about it that it 's almost fitting of an oxymoron : passionate indifference . i hope the creators/ '' actors '' in the film get out of debt from their efforts . they 'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life . see this movie if you 've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do ; otherwise , pass it by , and do n't worry that you 've missed some great , undiscovered talent . you really have n't .
bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida . where he meets a little penquin , which he tries to save from an eskimo . this short tries and the penquin is adorable , but in the end it 's a bit too light in the laughs department . the eskimo is n't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly , even other shorts when he 's paired with other unknown antagonists . so i ca n't in good conscience recommend this one . however it is nice to see it in it 's uncut form . this cartoon is on disk 3 of the `` looney tunes golden collection volume 1 '' my grade : c
this movie is an embarrassment to film-making . i ca n't believe it was even listed as a comedy - not funny . not only was the script atrocious , but the casting people should be shot . gail o'grady is just a great actress , but beyond that ... % 99 of the rest of the cast ... ouch . pretty much everyone else ... wow it is hard to even ... wow . here is the number one rule about comedy `` do n't try to be funny '' . there are a lot of very talented actors in canada who can do drama and comedy - none of them were used in this film . canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film-making in canada . i realize this is technically a `` us '' film , but look at the director , actors , location , etc . i just saw this on bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film . again , there are a lot of great films out there that ca n't get airtime and they show this crap .
it 's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all . it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen . not only have i ever been this bored before ( luckily not for more then 1,5 hours ) , the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted . after the first very awkward part , you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better . you hope in vain , it only goes downhill from there . the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times . one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again ...
words really ca n't describe how bad this film is . i thought zandalee was bad , but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off . this is just laughable ! terrible script , poor direction , awful acting and you know what ? i ca n't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it is n't too long . if you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment , book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work - far more enjoyable and much better value for money ( assuming that you need it ! ) . incidentally , i need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review - please do not buy this movie . it is terrible !
i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script , bad acting except for janine turner , no fantasy , stupid plot , dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings . if you have never seen this movie before do n't even bother it 's not worth it at all . the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner , did a good job acting . terry 's husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off . he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut . her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her . nice girl huh . yeah she 's a real peach , not . she 's no day at the beach either .
i do n't see how anyone who even likes van damne could like this movie . the movie actually starts out with some promise . i would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent . the actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story . however , the film is all down hill from there . it would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise . that is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills . one brother is supposed to be skilled in martial arts , but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms . how convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman , and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks . the plot , action , etc . are just plain ridiculous . my favorite scenes ? how about when van damne is confronting an armed soldier with an ak-47 . the soldier is about 100 yards away . instead of aiming and shooting at van damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him . van damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him , ... while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away . this movie has one of the most disappointing endings . bolo yeung is a skilled martial artist . however , instead of choreographing a decent fight . bolo is throwing barrels at van damne like donkey kong . absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise . if your a van damne fan , save your time and see hard target or one of his earlier films .
i saw the film tonight at a free preview screening , and despite the fact that i did n't pay a dime to see this film i still felt ripped off . ladies and gentlemen , time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a benjamin on your seat . the acting is torpid at best ; kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer , and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zeta-jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey . eva longoria is a non-entity ; she looks like she 's reading her lines off a teleprompter . and if you ca n't spot the `` mole '' within the first 20 minutes , then you just landed on this planet from a world without tv and recycled story lines . if you truly want to see a good secret service thriller , rent in the line of fire . if you see and buy into this one , you 'll start to fear for the president 's safety because the secret service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210 . no matter what your feelings about w , let 's hope this `` art '' does not imitate life .
in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego , only beaten by the new king kong movie . superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights . brandon routh was the worst superman i 've ever seen , from the start of the movie u just wan na shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat . he looks just silly wearing the costume . but enough about him , kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane , she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter , but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl . the plot was weak and predictable ( wow , he is actually supermans son , who would have ever thought .... ) and the acting was horrible . this movie has one good thing going for it , and it 's name is kevin spacey . his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie . what this movie needed was the cast of `` lois and clark '' ( except kevin spacey of course ) and a different story . i watched this movie after watching `` the hills have eyes '' and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that .
i figured that it 's about time i let this one out . pokémon fans are suffering in america these days . why ? because we rely on kids wb and 4kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . as far as the series goes , they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television . so what is their problem when it comes to the movies ? honestly now , i have seen all three pokémon movies in japanese and i will definitely be seeing the fourth one . they are excellent movies . they are all enjoyable and fun to watch . and , after seeing pokémon 2000 in theaters , i ca n't help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts . the way it appears , it seems that they read and see something that says ` insert empty moral here ' in big bold faced letters . it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb ( extreme sarcasm there ) and created this crap . * possible spoilers from here on * well , i guess i should first talk about pikachu 's rescue adventure . my first gripe with this came with no narration . i guess they got enough bad comments on the pokédex narration that plagued pikachu 's vacation , and , instead of going with a caring , gentle woman 's voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai , they just cut the narration all together . this would n't have been a problem , except for one thing . did anyone really understand why the exeggcute did n't let togepi go until the end ? possibly the fans , but i 'm sure not the parents . then , there 's the theme song . i could n't help but roll my eyes at this one . the japanese theme song was ` tankentai wo tsukurou ' and was sung by japanese children . it was fun and enjoyable . this one : nauseating . now , one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana . nice music , fun to watch . that 's changed with the bellossom . the music sucked for one , but on top of that , they had all the pokémon talk during the music , which turned out to be jumpy , annoying , and just unnecessary . oh , and then there 's the poliwhirl who thinks he 's a poliwrath . you 'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . basically , not much could save this little ill fated dub , which is very unfortunate considering its potential . but , i have n't touched on the worst of it yet . you 'd think that the warning signs would 've been apparent to me when i received my issue of nintendo power . for some unfathomable reason , i had been placing some faith in 4kids and the wb . my thoughts were ` well , they screwed up on the first movie , but the second is different as far as the theme goes , so they should do well . ' that in mind , i just did n't pay attention to the warning signs i encountered in the theaters when the trailers said , ` you will believe that one person can make all the difference . ' with the way they said that at every turn , i was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version . then comes nintendo power , in which i see all my fears realized in the words ` the main feature 'the power of one . ' at that point , i became a bit more uneasy . ` the power of one ? ! ' not a good sign . however , i still kept some of my false faith . big mistake . sitting in the theater , i was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which i loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . i hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . i can see a point in that since they did n't pander this thing , repeating it over and over like in msb . however , it did more damage than anything else in this movie . first of all , the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read ` the world turns to ash . ' ah hah . so , ash is the chosen one ? whatever . in the japanese version , the inhabitants of arshia needed a pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . this time , he 's the chosen one . a greater way that this did damage was to lugia . lugia was one of the coolest characters in a pokémon movie .... when the movie was about lugia . in this one , lugia is forced to take a back seat to ash . in the scene where they 're flying back to the main island , lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugia 's existence , not that ash is going to make all the difference . overall in this category , ash was n't really the ` one person ' that would make the difference , since he was helped by many along the way . a lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . furura 's flute song was n't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one . jirarudan 's speech to them saying his collection ` started with a mew card ? ' ugh . even worse , misty 's outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held . ` why did n't you put them in pokéballs when you caught them ? this is like caging them to be displayed . ' much different from whining about him thinking pokémon are things to be collected like stamps . if there were any real redeeming values in this , they came from team rocket . some pretty funny lines . not really to make me laugh out loud , but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . well , that was officially the last american pokémon movie i 'm going to see . i 've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . i would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . i 'll be importing the fourth one as well . forget you , kids wb and 4kids . you have forsaken me for the last time .
dude , really ! ! ! ! where have you guys been the past 20 years , this is shocking in all kind of ways , horror ? this is a joke , there is nothing wrong with being low budget , but this is a laugh , if you want to look at the classics , freaks of tod browning , the victims of dracula and frankenstein , the undying monster , ernest thesiger , paul wegener 's the golem and the passengers of the ghost train , you ca n't compare it , it gives it a bad name , bad acting , bad screenplay etc . total waist of money and free time , have watched a lot of movies , were as horror is my all time favorite , i really am speechless , have nothing more to say that please do n't do the effort to watch something so daft , please understand
there is something in most of us , especially guys , that admires some really working class small town `` real men '' populist fare . and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top . hey , a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy , but i do n't rate movies or actor/directors based on politics or personality . that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does . while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director , i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since . okay , you have the gist of this there is this good cop , a small town trooper , joe , played against type by david morse , who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars . the bad guy stops , gets out , shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead . there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man 's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone . so we know that joe , the farmer forced off his land into a cop job , is a good basic sort of guy . then his brother frank shows up , he is a sadistic , amoral bully , fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up . some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral , sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off . then there is mom and dad , marsha mason and charles bronson , who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple , then die off ; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide , to advance the story for us . both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob . but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife . but joe has a nice wife , played by italian actress valeria golina , who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut . for me , that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool . but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend 's car , robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do . then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them . so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater . accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate , except for the 60 's era effect , to win the hearts of old hippies . the worst offense is that , since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song , `` the highway patrolman '' , that song was not included . so joe 's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim 's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife . the bartender is good ole ceasar , played by dennis hopper . so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves . so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away . instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50 's junker on some lonely road at night , and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe , the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence . oy , such dreck ! then to top off this drecky sap fest , there is some zen crap about the indian runner , who is a messenger , becomes the message , ala marshall macluhen ? see what i mean , sean has done much better than this so do n't be afraid to miss this one .
guys who-ever even thinks about watching this movie has already got some disturbance going through their heads .. this movie has nothing to do with jack the ripper ( incase you thought ) its another b , i mean e-grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their spleens splattered on a nearby tree . its not scary , funny or amusing . if you really feel like gory stuff with no plot , then watch cabin fever , at least the director did not fall asleep midway through directing this crap.only watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life & the only thing on tv is oprah winfrey crying on the tv set .
i bought unhinged because i got suckered by the gory picture on the cover . if you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box . all the kills are shown and i can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie . having said that , let 's look at the plot . a group of college girls driving to a rock concert ( by way of the deep , dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid ) slide off the road . no visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film ( or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began ) . the two remaining girls wake up in a big , isolated house . the house , by the way , is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film . for some reason , though , this house has no roads going to it . the only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods . the girls spend the rest of unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch ( who looks like george washington in drag ) and her equally homely , sexually repressed daughter . the girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of gilligan 's island for that three hour tour . by the time we , the viewers , get to the kill scenes , we no longer care . we wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film . it 's almost as though the ending , the one good idea in the film , was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it . unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting , inept directing , and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film ( sorry . i 'm not sure where that came from ) . you will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when , for some reason that is never explained , the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering . do n't waste your time . you 'll just feel unhinged and want your time and money back .
oh my , i think this may be the single cheesiest movie i 've ever seen . i 'm serious , this is one of the ultimate b-movies . the first proof is that it is n't a $ 5 dvd . oh no , that 's too mainstream for this . i got this on vhs , from a bin full of ex-rental videos at my local video store . if i may quote the blurb : `` in 17th century japan , there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages . his name was mayeda . he is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the king of spain . whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives . mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan . '' it then goes on to say `` a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents '' i must have seen a different movie . this was no epic , and it certainly was n't a multi million dollar anything . no , 'shogun mayeda ' is really just the crazy adventures of the engrish-speaking mayeda ( sho kosugi ) . he is n't even a shogun really , but thats not important . what is important , is that he does a really cool impression of john cleese 's repeated charging of the one castle in 'monty python and the holy grail ' , and his ability to go from serious scenes to showing off his samurai mind powers . awesome . the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi 's engrish accent . the movie may lack nearly everything that makes a good movie , but makes up for it with some of the cheesiest lines ever , delivered by the coolest engrish accent ever . and honestly , do you really want anything else ? you could fast forward 'shogun mayeda ' to the end , and replay kosugi 's final line over and over . the tape will probably wear out before you get tired of that one line . awesome . 2/10 - so very very cheesy .
someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago . this is one of the worst films released in years , an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing . this thing should have been smothered at birth . i hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster . he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed , his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture .
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent . let 's see : first , they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread . next , they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget . and finally , when the film hits the theaters , get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again , bus them into the multiplexes if necessary , not on the merits of the film itself , but because a # 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory . but that , of course , wo n't be enough . i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give `` left behind '' anything short of a glowing review will be deemed `` anti-christian . '' of course , this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign should n't surprise anyone . it is , after all , good old fashioned capitalism at work . what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole `` left behind '' mindset . as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality , it leaves me scratching my head . it would appear that there are many , many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a `` rapture '' is going to occur , and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air . what kind of reality , i wonder , are these people living in ? is this `` rapture '' something they actually believe in , or is it something they fervently want to believe in ? and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this `` rapture '' has not occurred , will they be disappointed and disillusioned ? will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the `` rapture '' is imminent ? in a way , i almost wish that such an event would occur ! what an interesting day that would be ! what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion , not in the anthropological sense the authors of the `` left behind '' series have portrayed , but as more of a stephen spielberg production , with boiling clouds , trumpets , angels descending out of the sky , moon turned to blood , the whole nine yards . imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true , just as the evangelists had been warning for years , and that there was something more awesome than just the cold , hard , physical reality we inhabit . would n't that be something ? ? ? yet in the final analysis , it 's that cold , hard , physical reality that i will content myself with . my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a `` rapture '' and the `` end times '' to make sense of it all ... nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently , thank you very much .
while the idea is more original than most sci-fi movies , the execution is , as usual lacking . while the practical mummy effects are not bad , and the `` gun nut '' character is over the top giggle inducing , the only real draw is to see morena baccarin and adam baldwin reunited on the small screen . i suspect that was the idea all along . they do the best they can with what they have but the `` must see '' moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when morena 's character sported some tomb raider style shorts . not high brow cinema i know but you ca n't deny true beauty when you see it ! ! ! and adam baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate . if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you . if you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere .
like 'first blood ' , this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets , but there really is n't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire , burnings , stabbings , torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible rambo takes out half of asia , a ton of vietnamese soldiers , most of the russian army , various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at . the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off , allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises . helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is jerry goldsmith , who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from russian rat-a-tat to chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we do n't quite understand who we 're looking at . stallone has a brain in his head ; this empty nonsense is beneath him .
it is difficult to find any positives in this movie . seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history . the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms . more action shots of the two cops & a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go . of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun . ms albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate . ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent . apart from ms albright this is real garbage .
i 'm a big fan of troma but i ca n't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie , it 's so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours . some where on the plot summary it says `` but what satan does n't know he 's stuck with annoying tourists '' well they did n't seem to bother him in the movie , just me . the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan , i like bad movie 's but it was just boring .
1940 . - a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi-occupied poland , recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co-operation of the jewish community , is combined with archival footage , clips from international newsreels , and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the world 's jews as swindlers and parasites . this 'documentary ' interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-semitism and nazi ideology . a candid , cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred . i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive . one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again .
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview , else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie . i mean have n't we had enough of this yet ? scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious ! the plot sucks , and the acting is the worst i 've seen . ( only godzilla can compare , which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i 've seen in the cinema with this one . ) there is so many plot holes in the story , and the girls are so alike , that you do n't even now who has been killed , and who has not . ( and you do n't care . ) the only of them i knew in advance was denise , and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie . stay as far away from this movie as possible . ( 2/10 )
i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation . but the simplicity and `` intelligence '' of this film were boring . i 've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point . now that i 've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines . there 's tones about society , racism , and some desire ... but south park has that . and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion . the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes . i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film . i gave this film a one .
oh god , i must have seen this when i was only 11 or twelve , ( do n't ask how ) i may have been young , but i was n't stupid . anyone could see that this is a bad movie , nasty , gross , unscary and very silly . i 've seen more impressive effects at disneyland , i 've seen better performances at a school play , and i 've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo , where they do nothing but sit in the water , ignoring the children tapping on the glass . the story is set in northern australia . a handful of ambitious young people , are trying out a new water sport , surfing in shark filled waters . it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water . after they learn what , they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman , who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family . i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years , the best of which is lake placid , and the worse of which is its sequel . blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think , with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind . the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there , resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year . movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature , but a good hour and a half of the viewer 's life . unless you really want to see it , avoid blood surf .
the germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun . the good guys never die , unless its for dramatic purposes . the `` plot '' has so many holes its laughable . ( where did the german soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train ? erik estrada ? please ! ) and the whole idea , hijacking a train ? how moronic is that ! the germans know where you are going to go , its not like you can leave the track and drive away ! what a waste . i would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again . i mean , seriously , it felt like it was made in the 60s , but it was produced in 88 ! ! 1988 ! ! the a-team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie . only watch it if you need a good laugh . this movie is to tele sevalas what green beret was to john wayne .
this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale . a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy . they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence . however , after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence . however , out of no where , when they are on a luxury cruise , the ship sinks and they lose everything -- and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life ! what an odd , silly and preachy film ! personally , i 'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable ! the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions -- a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .
what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make , running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate . the whole production feels cheap and shabby , and it 's not helped by a `` big name '' star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he 's given in a credible fashion . at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material ; they 're clearly watching the clock here . bang out the scenes , get the pay cheque , go home , and try to forget all about it . it 's not particularly badly scripted or filmed ; there are no real clangers , it 's just utterly anodyne , and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras . the pacing is a little bizarre ; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts , which makes it feel irrelevant . maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored , and for being a fun game of `` spot the kiwi bit parters '' ; most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena : warrior princess . the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break .
boy what a dud this mess was.but it only lasts an hour and i only paid a buck for it so i 'll live .... unlike the entire cast of this 1933 clunker who are all dust by now . so anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood.the local yokels start talking about vampires , of course , and a little more loudly after each body is found.the town sheriff or constable or whatever he is , played by awesome actor melvyn douglas , tries to tell them otherwise.when he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck , instead of two holes close together , the locals simply then say it 's a giant vampire bat.the constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings . but melvyn does n't seem too bothered either way.he spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie , played by faye wray.also in this mix is the town simpleton , played by dwight frye , who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did.he further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood.lionel atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes.and boy does he ever stink as an actor.atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get.and lionel barrymore is also in this thing .... lots of big names to be such a pile of guano . other than the terrible mis-title this movie has , the alternate name , '' the blood sucker '' is much better , this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly . for me the high point of the movie is watching frye , he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie did n't offer much.and then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you 'll really be let down . bela lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch.think of this movie as a really bad lugosi clunker without lugosi and you 'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was . if you ca n't make a good 1930 's horror film at least put lugosi in it .
the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel . since the real star , dolph lundgren , would not be able to reprise his role from the original , there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off . bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white . to their credit , they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film , and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . for once , his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times , and it does not get irritating . the problem from the audience 's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films . and therein lies the problem . you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action . you go because you want comedy , however unintentional . unbeknownst to many people , universal soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels . i have only seen the first , which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career , the sight of jean-claude van damme comes as a welcome relief . the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels , and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . after years of investigation and explanation , the unisol project is still going ahead , with some minor modifications . for one , the new unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins . for another , all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth . in the early parts of the film , seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome . being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes , we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . the unisol project is on the chopping block , which essentially means that seth will be turned off . seth , somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained , decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . his only problem is that every so often , a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . two individuals possess the code in question . seth kills the first in short order , and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme 's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . the rest of the film revolves around the unisols ' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly . a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film , but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting . the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés . when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white , we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity 's weakness ( es ) . gee , seth , you mean they will not be our strong points ? all kidding aside , the short length of the film is both the film 's weakness and its strength . it leaves the action without adequate setup . in the original , we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols , how they work , and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . here , the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate . at least in the original , a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . here , one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform ( and presumably his body ) , getting up every time without stopping for breath . i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . if you can see it on the cheap , knock yourself out . this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre .
i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i 've ever seen . i did not laugh once throughout this short , and it 's a bugs bunny cartoon , for christ 's sake ! bugs bunny cartoons are always funny , not boring ! alas , this short turns out to be good night elmer ( another incredibly boring jones short ) with the addition of bugs bunny . the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff . good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff . this cartoon , on the other hand , is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon : there 's too much dialogue . the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve , but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue . at one point , elmer finishes eating dinner , and comments , `` that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb , '' possibly the most redundant dialogue i 've ever heard in a cartoon ( characters reading text out loud in the later-era woody woodpecker cartoons does n't count in my book ) . even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long , it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this . elmer 's pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me , but if you 've sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career , you might enjoy it .
warning ! do n't even consider watching this film in any form . it 's not even worth downloading from the internet . every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid . the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film . they could n't tell a good joke to save their lives . it 's an insult to any human being . if you 're looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere else . let 's hope this mr. unterwaldt ( the `` jr. '' being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy ) dies a slow/painful death and never makes a film again . in fact , it 's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap , that 's why i 'll stop right now and rather watch a good film .
my name is modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of modesty blaise . it 's not that the movie is terrible , it 's just not what i was expecting or hoping for . while i 've been aware of the modesty blaise character for years , i 'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels , so i 'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider . that may be part of the reason for my disappointment . i was expecting more action and more comedy . the film is dialogue driven . i suppose i was looking for something with a little more camp value . as it is , my name is modesty is a deathly serious film . there are very few , if any , `` light '' moments . the acting , at least from alexandra staden , is acceptable but nothing outstanding . as others have commented , she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role . what action scenes there are in my name is modesty are one of the films weakest points . i never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers . i really hope quentin tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the modesty blaise character . i 'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and i would very much look forward to it .
this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it . it 's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next . i rented this movie because i 'm a david bowie fan , and i really appreciate musicals . in finality , bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired . the moral of the story was really befuddling . i could n't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out . for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the `` no selling out '' message . when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up . maybe i rented half of two different movies ? nope , there was a `` keep britain white '' song and dance sequence . i 'm sorry , but wwii is not something you can write a musical about . at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as `` campy '' as i have several times in this review . overall i 'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors . ( and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit ! ) my grade : c-
a less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the catholic church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show . throughout the show , dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked , especially `` if god is so good , why does he allow evil to exist in the world ? '' diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version ( though some might disagree ) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the `` company line '' and condemns half the world to burn in hell . to celebrate her school 's 25th anniversary , she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas pageant . however , when the quartet `` update '' their play to parody sister mary 's `` fallacious '' teachings , the nun is pushed over the edge , sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events . the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts . not recommended . go watch the play instead .
when i first saw this film it was not an impressive one . now that i have seen it again with some friends on dvd ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ) , my opinion remains the same . the subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .
i 've seen this film because i had do ( my job includes seeing movies of all kinds ) . i could n't stop thinking `` who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival ! '' it was n't only boring , the actors were awful as well . it was one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
as someone who has read the book , i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow . there are various reasons for this . firstly , emma is too unpleasant . yes , she has faults , and is n't the easiest person to like - but the viewer should n't downright start to despise her . secondly , mr knightly is miscast . his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen , and throw the mood of the whole affair `` off '' . thirdly , samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet ; and why was she made to look so sickly ? harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she 's going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene . fourthly , the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut . at the end , when emma decides she loves mr knightly , it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative has n't been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film . fifthly , what was going on , exactly , with mrs elton 's accent ? she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning , to all out american half-way through , and then back to english at the end . finally , this dragged at the end . the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly . this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony . all in all , a rather haphazard attempt . read the book or rent the paltrow version instead
i read the book a long time back and do n't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it . since i 'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey ! ! it is a lifetime movie . the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses . the female cast is right out of desperate housewives . i 've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist . is there nothing original anymore ? sure , but not on lifetime . the male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose . in one scene a female is struggling with a male , for her life , and what does she do ? ? ? kicks him in the testicles . what else ? women love that but let me tell you girls something ... it 's not as easy as it 's always made to look . it was n't all bad . i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that .
this should be my kind of movie . even if it sucked , it still should have been right up my alley ; hell , i like `` congo , '' and `` allan quatermaine '' movies . i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies . let 's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place . 1 . horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2 . i 'm a big fan of archaeology , and this movie does involve a rare treasure . 3 . super-natural enemies with quality fx . 4 . christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy . 5 . tara reid is hot . so this movie had potential , at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store , but boy did it suck ass . the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf , and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do ... i mean , let 's face it , both are melodramatic . but now on to some of the many faults . tara reid . even though the movie as a whole is worse , reid 's performance is truly awful . we 're not just talking bad , i 'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year . i do n't know if she is capable of acting , but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely . watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was n't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn . i mean this is n't just bad , it is laughably bad . oh , and for those of you curious , she does n't get naked , only down to a bra in a silly , totally unnecessary love scene . even with reid 's performance , perhaps the movie could have worked , but the plot is what dominates , and the plot seems written by a 10 year old . i had n't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd , otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time . the storyline jumps back and forth from slater 's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened , he has amnesia , of course . in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713 , a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something . slater had to leave because he was too rebellious , i guess , you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during . the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts , obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a `` chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities . '' i may have the exact quote wrong , but you get the idea . there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth ( no reason given ) , experiments on children , super demon/alien-human hybrids , `` photonic '' bullets ( the demon things ca n't stand sunlight ) and , of course , slater and dorf to try to save everyone . jesus , i ca n't even being to wade through the clichéd elements . the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth . i mean , why is this evil scientist so damn evil ? oh right , humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race . i guess he 's infected ? how did that happen ? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself . how the hell did that happen ? why and where did he get the super slugs ( oh yes , they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which `` fuse '' with the spine of their host ) of course , slater is , like blade , half super-slug powered , but his slug `` did n't fully fuse due to an electrical shock , '' thank god . oh , and the people with these `` fused '' spines , have no idea they 're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies . yeah we get zombies . so lots of crap that could be entertaining , but none of it is . also , the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite ca n't handle . not the very worst thing you 'll see , but a truly bad movie .
honestly , this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen . partly , because it takes itself so seriously , as opposed to regular light hearted trash , this movies wants you to be emotionally involved , to feel for the characters , and to care about the alleged conspiracy . none of this ever even comes close to happening . * * * * mild spoilers * * * * * * there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible : 1 . ) incoherent and totally non-sensical plot . 2 . ) annoying style-over-substance `` mtv '' camerawork . 3 . ) moronic characters and plot holes . allow me to elaborate . 1 . ) apparently , when this movies was being made , they could n't decide whether to make a movie about church conspiracies , the stigmata , or possession . so , guess what ? they combined them ! an aetheist gets possessed by a dead person , who then makes her exhibit the stigmata so as to expose a church conspiracy . how a regular person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary is never explained , nor even talked about . now , instead of just saying what he wants to say , he gives her the stigmata . why ? why not just spit it out ? instead , we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices , carving cryptic messages on cars , and writing messages on walls . apparently this priest was also a violent guy , because the possessed young lady also wigs out on one o f the characters , while talking in that cliched , harsh , `` possessed '' voice that we all have heard countless times . this also starts to tie into my second complaint , because whenever the young lady gets the stigmata , she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air , and tossing everything and everybody around her as if they were in an earthquake ? why does this happen ? who knows ! ? ! my guess is that the director thought it looked `` cool '' . 2 . ) this movies contains dozens of shots , in slow motion , of course , of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off , and most annoyingly , of water dripping . this woman 's apartment is constantly dripping water ! constantly ! logically , the place would probably fall apart with this many holes . to sum up this complaint , towards the end , and for absolutely no reason , the camera cuts to shots of water dripping , in slow motion , in reverse ! ! why ! ? ! i have no idea ! it has no relevance to anything , and once again , i 'm betting it 's because the director thought it looked `` cool '' . 3 . ) one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science . this does n't make sense to me . i would think that going to church would be enough , but no , he has to go through the entire rigamarole of becoming a priest . i just do n't buy it . secondly , there are lots of plot holes , a few of which i will elaborate on below . for starters , when she first gets the stigmata , the scene ends with her laying unconscious , bleeding . next , she 's in the hospital . who called the ambulance ? another one is towards the end , when the previously mentioned `` scientific priest '' character is talking to the spirit who is possessing the girl . he says , `` take me as your messenger ! '' not a word for word quote , but you get the idea . his response ? `` you have no faith , only doubt ! '' so , because of this , he possesses an aetheist ! an aetheist has no faith , far less then any scientific priest ! and then , there 's the fact that the object of this movie 's conspiracy , this lost gospel ( of st. thomas , i believe ) is available at local bookstores . the characters are willing to kill to supress this document , but you could walk down to a bookstore and buy it . maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history , where it is n't wide known , but the movie never tries to tell us this , or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that document 's uncovering . in closing , this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree . it is my arch-nemesis , which i feel the need to insult every chance i get . i loathe it . final grade : f
no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer . after all , very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take , and that was pretty much sinatra 's modus operandi on set . i feel that as the 1960 's wore on , the quality of the man 's films really started to tank . the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin 's matt helm series which came out at the same time . perhaps even a james bond competition , but nothing really worked for frank during these years . his personal life in shambles , his music fading out ... sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950 's . the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan 's express in 1965 .
this was director von stroheim 's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks , greed and the wedding march . essentially we have a trio of grifters , masquerading as a russian count and two russian princesses who have rented a villa in monte carlo . their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune . part of that plan is for the count ( von stroheim ) to insinuate himself between a visiting american ambassador and his `` foolish '' wife , wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses . he makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid , whom he has promised to marry . when she sees them together , she sets fire to the room , ( von stroheim and his prey are on the room 's balcony ) . here von stroheim first establishes his persona as `` the man you love to hate . '' he is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end . the film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director . there is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the ambassador 's wife , she is reading a book - we see the title - foolish wives by erich von stroheim . this was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film , cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes . the restoration on kino video restores surviving footage ( damaged in some way in most scenes ) from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute print .
first let me preface this post by saying that i am a fan of the original star wars movies ... i do n't read the books , play the games , wear the underwear or eat the cereal ( if there is one ) . i am simply a fan of the films . with that being said , i struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise . taking this movie by itself , and not comparing it to it 's terrible predecessors ( ep 1 , 2 ) , i do n't understand how you can say this is an amazing movie . for all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue , contrived scenes ( ie r2 suddenly being a badass , and long cgi intense chase scenes that have little human touch ) , horrible acting , and noted plot holes ... how is this good ? there was no real internal dilemma within anakin ; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden . i was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so ( which by the way was ruined by the `` noooooo ! '' frankenstein scene ) . when you bombard the screen with intensely amazing cgi effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said , this is not a great movie . for a film with such a `` dark '' tone , there was too much levity in the speech of all characters . i close with a question : from the beginning to the end of the film , was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place ?
cq was the worst film i saw this year . nearly every film i choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say . this film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his intro . to filmmaking class . his father makes great films . his sister made a good one . but brother roman ? no ! one critic had the audacity to compare this film to godard 's le mépris ( contempt ) . while coppola , jr. did take the same idea , a film about film , he tried too hard to make himself seem european , artsy , and witty , when it 's all really just kitsch . the lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film , like he 's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him . schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director . depardieu is alright . the one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is , surprisingly , not the b-movie scenes , but rather one which takes place in italy ; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car , driving around picking up and dropping off random people . this was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema i am guessing he was trying to spoof . or rip-off . or both . the documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out , the ending was tagged on for the sake of a `` twist '' or artistic value ... i suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself , and not in the way it intended . no wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever , which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before . i ca n't believe it could have been worse than this . if you want to see a good parody of film check out the austin powers films . any of them . the opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film . lil ' romy , for the sake of cinema , please go back to directing your cousin 's music videos . leave the godfathers to daddy .
bela lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to dracula . he is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie does n't set the mood very well . even at its worst any of bela 's movies is only mediocre though .
this movie was like a bad indie with a-list talent . the plot was silly , all the way to the end . it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980 's . i would have given it a one , but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile . i think the worst thing was the underwater scene 's held off of the dock . the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were , and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air , this air tank would kind of appear . i would avoid this , unless there is nothing else on the shelf . good day .
sadly it was misguided . this movie stunk from start to finish . it was hard to watch because i used to watch clarissa explains it all every day on nickelodeon . i loved her . then the next thing i found she did a spread in maxim and she was gorgeous ! i have n't really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident . i could n't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it . everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship . too bad .. i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie .
having enjoyed jean arthur in `` the devil and miss jones '' , my interest was peaked , so i tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey -- but i did n't make it to the end . arthur , photographed in a gauzy , movie-magazine fashion , either wants alimony from ex-husband william powell or another shot at marriage , but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks ( she 's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness , but once inside a morgue -- like all women in these '30 's comedies -- she faints ) . william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur , but you 'd never know it from the end result ; they look awkward standing next to each other , hesitant over their banter . the actor playing powell 's valet is excruciating , and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease .
i think this movie was supposed to be shocking . but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it 's been made ... and simply is . it 's one-and-a-half hour of torment . even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie ( the five girls ) . sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way , which is basically fine , since it 's a horror-movie . and i ( usually ) like horror-movies . i 've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se . however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever . it 's no spectacle other than that it 's simply grotesque . it 's so lame it even gets boring , and really quick too . the worst thing ( if the above was n't bad enough for ya ) about this movie is that they 've tried to copy the blair whitch project , by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras . but ( again , this too ) serves no end whatsoever . in the `` blair which '' , sure enough , there 's an explanation , namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch . in this film , there 's no other explanation than : `` hey ya 'll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch ! ! '' the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about . the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you ca n't make out what they 're saying . also , no effort has been made to make anything any better , sound-wise or other wise . than finally , there 's the soundtrack , which is just as bad as the rest , and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock ... my advise : do n't watch this under any circumstances .
i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales . well , for the previous , it is better than daytime television .... though i 'm not sure how much . it does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes , the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together . in short , a terrible sci fi channel type movie . it has its points such as the future is dirty , like `` blade runner '' showed ..... of course , this is no `` blade runner '' . the captain looks , sort of feels like actor robert forster , the kind of person one might want to be around . but unfortunately , it rather ends up feeling like a bad `` andromeda '' rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of `` aliens '' , the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified , and the new captain might as well be like jan-michael vincent running around on `` danger island '' in the `` banana splits '' ; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets ; he 's got very little right to it . all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'eureka maru ' as they are fighting a class of 'people ' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities ....... just like the nietzcheans in `` andromeda '' . it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside , but after a while , one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot ! he probably had fun doing it , but it does n't help the movie much . it 's ..... `` okay '' . okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off ; if they watch it with commercials , they will probably change the channel . one might watch it once .......... but a few hours later , be wondering what it was that made them watch it all . for me , that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting .
oh geez ... there are so many other films i want to see out there ... i got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted - yeah ... i used to watch this show when i was in college ... it was mindless , kinda fun , and somewhat action-oriented . the show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute ; no one ever got killed or even hurt badly ... it was like a cartoon come to life . cut to 2005 ... what happened ? this one does n't work . as others have said , there simply is n't a cohesive story and the performances are weird ... almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters ... the whole thing is a like a mad tv skit and it lasts over 100 minutes ! this was one of the few times i 've been embarrassed watching a film . what were they thinking ? as best i can tell , must 've been for the product marketing , toys , etc . all i can say is , let this one die a quick death . it makes the original dukes of hazzard seem like masterpiece theater ... i think the only remake left to do from tv is gilligan 's island ... good luck !
with all the excessive violence in this film , it could 've been nc-17 . but the gore could 've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend . there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch , then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow , there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people . the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this . almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off , but the teacher who called him `` white trash '' and `` hoodlum '' ( though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum , not even close , i know hoods and am part hood , they do n't draw in class , they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher ) . the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters , but was just stabbed in the back . there were two suspenseful scenes in the film , but did n't last long enough to be scary at all . as i said , the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off . if the gore was actually fun to see , then it would 've been nc-17 . two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields , they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was , they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines . his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach , though i would 've liked to see that . the acting was pathetic , characters were losers , and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts . i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes , i wont see it again anytime soon , but i enjoyed the excessive violence . also , do n't bother with the sequel , i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death , it sounds good but is n't . the original scarecrow actually kept me interested .
i grew up watching the original disney cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn . accordingly , i was excited to see that cinderella 2 was coming on tv and i would be able to see it . i should have known better . this movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone . it holds absolutely none of the originals super charm ! it seems , to me , quite rough , and almost brutal , right from the ( do n't ) sing-a-longs to the characterization . while i remember the character 's telling a story through a song , this film 's soundtrack was laid over the top , and did n't seem to fit . jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! and in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . it 's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set . the upbeat fiddles certainly did n't fit . even the artwork and animation in cinderella 2 is n't up to scratch with the original . the artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed . and we see part of cinderella 's hoop skirt , which does n't feel right . the movie itself could have been it 's own story , i think that it should have been just that . i would n't say that i hate it , but i believe that it had many shortcomings . it seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved cinderella original .
i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films , but i can not believe this got past the script stage . the dialogue is appalling , the acting very dodgy , the accents just awful , and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best . i do n't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad . joseph fiennes , pretty as he is , might just have killed his career as quickly as it started . the island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage .
snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station , as you toss this into the waste disposal unit . spend a useful 90 min . living your favourite game . disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk . it takes a bits from several other `` science fiction '' movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story . there 's nothing new here , the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game , but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film . any money spent watching this is a waste , and personally i would like my 90 min of life back .
i know that in this episode there 's other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss , and in fact i think it has some virtues ; for example , the fact , after we had been given a very negative opinion of jin from seeing sun 's flashbacks in `` house of the rising sun '' , we get to see jin 's side of things and get a new , more balanced understanding of his life . but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode . before now , in the scene where jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt , it had been hinted that sun 's father was someone who was getting rich through shady , illegal methods . i thought maybe he was a mob boss , even ; mobs operate in korea , just like in almost every other country in the world , so it was a reasonable possibility . however , in this episode we learn that sun 's father is in fact the boss ( or a top executive ) of a korean automotive company , and that what jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official ( who was actually going to be murdered ) on his behalf . i may be especially touchy about this because i happen to work in the automotive industry , but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea ; that huge , serious companies like hyundai or kia ( which must be the model for this fictitious car company , as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality ) operate with these mafia-like methods , instead of like any normal automotive company of the west . it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story , and that there has n't been an uproar in korea over it . it feels like extraneous `` buy american ! '' propaganda , portraying foreign car companies as criminal , untrustworthy , third-world outfits .
who did the research for this film ? it 's set in baghdad in 2004 , however all the soldiers are wearing acus and have all universal camouflage pattern gear . no one was wearing that stuff in 04 . i just saw this film while deployed overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf ? this movie made no sense , had characters come and go with no explanation , and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life . i realize that it 's a movie , but it 's obviously trying to portray something realistic . it fails miserably , but it 's trying . it 's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas , chewed them up and swallowed , then vomited out a film . i would not recommend this film to anyone . i 'm still not sure why i sat through the whole thing . gi joe was one that really made you think compared to this . stay away !
this movie is bizarre . better put , it 's `` freakin ' weird '' . i could give you a plot summary , or some hoity toity analysis , but i would consider it a waste of your time . all anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters , one incestuous relationship , homicide , post mortem mutilation , and one really disturbing infatuation . at the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself , but not in a good way like after `` pulp fiction '' or `` fight club '' . it 's like you 're a teenager ( or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager ) and have just done something you a : wish you had n't done , and b : hope to the good lord of heaven and earth that your parents never find out about . and nobody likes that . my advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth , just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch `` kazaam '' ( yes , i would rather watch `` kazaam '' than `` murderous maids '' , read into it what you want ) .
anyone who has read my review for uwe boll 's `` alone in the dark '' will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out . well , take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine . do that , and you 'll have a general idea of what eli roth 's `` cabin fever '' is all about . i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the `` worst film ever made . '' but , in all honesty , i have to say `` cabin fever '' comes very close . this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release . for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does , he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life . how do you screw up a story like this ? think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters , without the bad writing , and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy . a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh-eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here . this script failed on so many levels with me . and , while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses , i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre . to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words . a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects ca n't even save it , and that is one element i normally go for . there really was nothing about `` cabin fever '' that i could easily recommend to anybody . when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through , you know the movie is sinking fast . my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing . one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again .
this movie delivers . the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he 's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off . but this movie does n't stop there , when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer . stereotypical grilling dads , several plot lines that go nowhere , and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home .
i finally caught up to `` starlight '' last night on television and all i can say is . . . wow ! it 's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects ( check out the laser beams shooting out of willie 's eyes ! ) , the atrocious acting , the ponderous dialogue , the mismatched use of stock footage , or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production . this truly is a one-of-a-kind experience , and we should all be thankful for that . i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood !
first off , the lead , brad dourif is a kook . if you 're trying to take this movie seriously , then , i guarantee he 's going to ruin it for you . if you do n't take him too seriously , then he 's actually kind of fun to watch . as with another reviewer , i loved the scene where lisa ( cynthia bain ) and dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car . another great campy scene was watching john landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room . in fact , i found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - i 'm just not sure if tobe hooper meant it to be that way .
lolita is a rebel and she 's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories , between sci-fi and fantasy ... well , this surrender cinema production is not very good : very bad acting , horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line . but , the sex scenes are pretty well done , lot of lesbian scenes , and jacqueline lovell , as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax , offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show . for lovell 's fans only .
i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made . if you ca n't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever . unfortunately joan rivers chose differently . the movie is full of predictable gags ( some of these are racist ) and very unfunny jokes . particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant ( as i write this , i can not believe this was actually a movie scene ) . the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth . rotflmao ! not ! the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is `` i knew i should have been on top . '' ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
spoilers of both this and the matrix follow . i liked the original matrix a great deal . it was not a deep movie , despite fishburne 's attempts to philosophize , but it was fairly well paced , fun , and i have a soft spot for hong kong fights . in the original , neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker anderson . by day , corporate drone , and by night , brave hacker . eventually , he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine , or does he go back to the safe , forgettable world he started in . interestingly , he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions , life rather sucks . he has his girl by his side and his boon companions , but he eats processed swill , dresses in sweats , and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery . still , the truth makes him free . at least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the `` what if it were me '' questions raised in the viewer 's mind . what if _i_ were capable of the impossible ? what if i were `` the one '' . it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of , with a cool title like that . further , agent smith made a wonderful bad guy , as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us . he was as unstoppable as a terminator , and as merciless . at the end of the matrix , neo must return to the matrix to share his good news of freedom . this movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie , and it does so with such lack of gusto , such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that i can not believe they had planned these changes . when the dialog is at a fifth grade level , with various long words dropped in randomly , i find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying . my short list of characterization failures : the oracle goes from mildly helpful , if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason . major `` personalities '' of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster , for example , was a cute idea , but just not that interesting a character . fishburne loses his `` advisor '' role , and gets nothing to replace it with . the people of zion are not particularly likable , nor would you really _want_ them running the world . special effects problems : the fight scenes are pointless and intermitable . in the matrix , you felt neo could lose , and that he had to become something greater in order to survive . in the matrix reloaded , he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game . the fight on the freeway looked quite fake , and not that interesting . pacing problems . as i mentioned above , the fight scenes were interminable . the rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch . not because we mind good dancing and good orgies , but because we did not know about the people pictured , nor did we care . whatever hack wrote the creator 's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business . it meandered , used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand , and was a waste of time and a pacing killer . the creator 's speech could have been done in a tenth the time , and with more peril as `` zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the matrix . there are now too many people who do not believe ; the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it . further , the earth can not support even the people in zion , let alone these others . you may choose one person from zion to form the new zion , while i wipe the memories of the people currently in the matrix . '' instead , we got a long , drawn out bunch of twaddle . if someone argues that it is deep , ask for a transcript , and try breaking down the sentences . each one is too long by several clauses , and uses words with clearer , shorter synonyms . so , in summary , not worth seeing . i have seen the third one , and despite what a number of reviewers have said , skip it . it does not save this turkey . the reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were `` deep '' should go see some truly deep movies . perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate , and perhaps a bit of philosophy . this movie is just not hard to understand , but it is hard to stomach . scott
i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by others . they definitely saw something in this movie i did n't see , that 's for sure . the movie starts off at a good pace , and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting , then it begins to get logged down and draggy , not to mention completely unbelievable . eventually you find yourself saying : `` what ? ! ? he 's going to do that too ? just how far is he going to go with this thing ? '' the plot begins with jeff goldblum 's character , john , going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine . there is a robbery and a new store clerk , auggie rose , gets killed during the robbery . john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy . this seems a little much , but wait , there 's more . john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose . for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense , john , who has a very good life , a beautiful , loving girlfriend , a secure , well-paying job , nice house , nice car , expensive suits -- decides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was , and experience life in a low paying job , living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people . why this dim-witted , half-baked film got favorable reviews i 'll never know . sure goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he 's in , i would n't recommend this turkey . it 's approximately two hours of your life you 're not going to get back - and believe me - you 'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over , other than being grateful you 're not still sitting there watching this film !
few films have left me with such a feeling of unease , and this is not a compliment . since i saw it in a theater ( how it ended there i can only wonder ) i was subjected to 90 mn of hateful , derivative garbage , the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie `` do n't answer the phone '' - but worse . the nastiness of it all , rape and all , is shown without any distance ( unlike strong stuff like `` last house on the left '' ) and utter contempt for the ( perfect ? ) victims and everybody involved , leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur . at the end i felt like taking a shower . no credits to the director
the head of a common new york family , jane gail ( as mary barton ) , works with her younger sister ethel grandin ( as loma barton ) at `` smyrner 's candy store '' . after ms. grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves , ms. gail and her policeman boyfriend matt moore ( as larry burke ) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman . `` traffic in souls '' has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is n't remarkably well done , and it does n't show anything very unique in having a young woman 's `` virtue '' threatened by sex traders . perhaps , it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length ( claimed to have been ten reels , originally ) . the new york city location scenes are the main attraction , after all these years . the panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable , because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move . * * * * traffic in souls ( 11/24/13 ) george loane tucker ~ jane gail , matt moore , ethel grandin
the wonderful `` z '' channel in los angeles showed this pia zadora film about six months or so after `` butterfly '' . i had such high hopes for the actress , and then she goes from bad to obviously worse in this film . again , it was the 80 's and i got ta tell you harold robbin 's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers . jacqueline susann ripped into him ( she hated his way of writing women ) , irwin shaw 's work caught on with many women , and of course sidney sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70 's early 80 's and then came jackie collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books , even more so . which is why this work smelt . harold robbin 's work in the 80 's just did n't catch on with audiences . pia zadora acting in one of robbin 's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire . the supporting cast was not a help either . oooooh ... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later , it looks even worse . i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done . it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress ( although john waters casting her in `` hairspray '' was a spark ) although she has a nice singing voice . hey , pia , wherever you are ... hairspray may go on tour ! join the show . you may be the biggest comeback story yet . i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do .
zombi 3 starts as a group of heavily armed men steal a experimental chemical developed to reanimate the dead , while trying to escape the man is shot at & the metal container holding the chemical is breached . the man gets some of the green chemical on a wound on his hand which soon after turns him into a flesh eating cannibalistic zombie . within hours the surrounding area is crawling with the flesh easting undead on the look out for fresh victims , kenny ( deran sarafian ) & his army buddies find themselves in big trouble as they stop to help patricia ( beatrice ring ) & her friend lia ( deborah bergammi ) who has been pecked by zombie birds ( ! ) . general morton is in charge of the situation & has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world ! but will he & his men succeed ? this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered a stroke & therefore could n't finish the film so producer franco gaudenzi asked second unit director bruno mattei & writer claudio fragasso to step in & complete the film . apparently mattei & fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded a lot of the footage fulci shot & added a lot of their own & zombi 3 ended up as nearly a straight 50/50 split . the script by fragasso is an absolute mess , none of it is well thought out & is just as stupid as it gets . the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd . the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever , look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge & the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like it 's on steroids , then for no reasonable explanation about 10 minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft . there are so many things wrong with zombi 3 , scene after scene of terribly thought out & ineptly directed action , awful character 's & really dull broken english dialogue which does n't make sense half the time . then there 's the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air & bite someones neck , the scene when the guy 's in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny & roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try & kill them by hand , even when kenny picks up a gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles & when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles & it 's one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film & then there 's the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but ca n't rest it down on the ground for literally a few seconds to pick his buddy up & then a load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass , what ? since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass ? this all may sound 'fun ' but believe me it 's not , it 's a really bad film that is just boring , repetitive & simply does n't work on any level as a piece of entertainment except for a few unintentional laughs . it 's hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot . it has a bland lifeless feel about it & for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist , the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine & you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine & thinning out as it disperses across the scene . since a lot of it is set during the day it does n't add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever & when they do get it right & the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on a foggy day ! the direction is poor with no consistency & it just looks & feels bottom of the barrel stuff . even the blood & gore is n't up to much , there 's a gory hand severing at the start , a scene when something rips out of a pregnant woman 's stomach , a legless woman ( what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way & why did n't it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her ? ) & a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets . for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70 's & early 80 's will be very disappointed , there are n't any decent feeding scenes , no intestines , no stand out 'head shots ' & very little gore at all . technically the film is poor , the special effects are cheap looking , the cinematography is dull , the music is terrible , the locations are bland & it has rock bottom production values . this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum . the entire film is obviously dubbed , the acting still looks awful though & the english version seems to have been written by someone who does n't understand the language that well . zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci 's classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 ( 1979 ) , it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash-in title . i 'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film , it 's boring , it makes no sense , it 's not funny enough to be entertaining & it lacks any decent gore . one to avoid .
okay , so i get it . we 're supposed to be horrified . the idea has been planted . a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it . call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this . but do n't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father ' ... i mean has n't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape , and molestation ' porn ... horror is n't what your mind can fool you into believing . it is what actually exists in film . this is where miike fails in visitor q. extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure .
this film is not funny . it is not entertaining . it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence , nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation . added to that it 's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory . it 's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like . this movie is boring , obnoxiously mind-numbing , and at times offensive and disgusting . at most , it contains one or two moments that make you laugh . also , it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time .
was convincing the world that he did n't exist ... this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people . it 's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold .. i mean sose .. i got another one like that : -the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline- this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making i have seen in a long time . it starts out so well , with really fantastic cinematography , great acting and a very smart premise . but alas , the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction . and it does so , not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts . pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut . with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree . i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story . and they vary from a story set totally in someones head , playing chess with himself , to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming . and that 's all jolly swell . but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story . and apart from that , it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like `` fight club , kill bill , casino , the usual suspects , snatch , magnolia and shachnovelle . and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here , it 's a blatant robbery . what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed . if this movie was a roller-coaster ride , you 'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off . there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved , that if it was a cocktail , you 'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it . nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it 's going , you get pulled in yet another one . i guess this story was n't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway , being the next david lynch or something . 1/10 for totally violating one 's own work ( ritchy : seek professional help ) . what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece , food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs . spare your soul and stomach , avoid at all cost !
la chute de la maison usher , or the fall of the house of usher as it 's know amongst english audiences , starts with allan ( charles lamy ) heading for the castle of his good friend sir roderick usher ( jean debucourt ) who sent him a letter saying that his wife madeleine is ill. once there allan finds madeleine very sick & her husband roderick determined & almost obsessed to paint her portrait . as roderick paints madeleine becomes weaker & weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her , allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes ... this french production was co-written , produced & directed by jean epstein & was the second of two filmed the fall of the house of usher adaptations during 1928 , honestly i do n't know the original novel was published in 1839 , i mean you wait 89 years for a filmed adaptation & two come along at the same time ! anyway , i feel that i have a bit of a problem here as i have read plenty of positive comments about la chute de la maison usher & maybe i 'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but i have to say that it simply did n't do anything for me . i did n't like it , obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film & therefore it relies on imagery but even so i thought the story was weak , i thought as a whole the film was boring & dull even though it only lasts for about an hour & it really did n't do anything for me at all . la chute de la maison usher was made almost 80 years ago & that is literally a lifetime , the world , cinema & tastes have moved on a lot since then & i found no enjoyment in this film . i feel this film has dated badly & probably was n't that good to start with anyway . i never felt for any of the character 's , i never cared about anything that was happening & i found it all rather tedious to sit through , i 'm sorry if i 've offended any silent film fans out there but that 's the way i felt . director epstein does an ok job , a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in la chute de la maison usher & i will freely admit it definitely has it 's moments but i thought they were few & far between . shots of people 's mouths moving & not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me , i did n't like the music & the version i saw kept the original french language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick french accent which was also off putting . based on the story by edgar allen poe i doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements , stick with the fantastic roger corman house of usher starring vincent price . technically the film was ok considering when it was made . you simply can not tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try & suggest emotions or reflect what 's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft . la chute de la maison usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era , who live in caves or who are stuck in the past , for me i like my films to have a story , not to bore me & to have sound & i 'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that 's how i feel . the world has moved on since 1928 & for the better .
revolt of the zombies starts with armand louque ( dean jagger ) trying to convince general duval ( george cleveland ) that his mate tsiang ( william crowell ) is a priest who has the power to hypnotise people & render them under his control turning them into mindless zombies ( a bit like the people i work with really ) . anyway , tsiang is murdered by colonel mazovia ( roy d'arcy ) but fails to gain the knowledge of turning people into zombies . an expedition has been set up by general duval to hunt for the secret since tsiang ai n't going to tell them much anymore . general duval heads the expedition along with his daughter claire ( dorothy stone ) who is engaged to louque who also comes along . during the expedition claire dumps louque for his mate clifford grayson ( robert noland ) at which louque is n't too pleased about . in a way that could only happen in a film louque finds the secret to turning people into zombies by himself & starts to use his new found power to gain revenge on claire & clifford ... co-written & directed by victor halperin revolt of the zombies has a bad reputation & after watching it i can see why . the script by halperin , howard higgin & rollo lloyd all uncredited , has a good central idea but is killed stone cold dead by being dull & as exciting as watching paint dry . nothing much happens for ages & then nothing much happens afterwards either . how halperin depicts his zombies is different to that which most modern audiences would consider to be a zombie , these zombies are just brainwashed people & filmgoing audiences would have to wait over thirty years before george a.romero would define what a zombie is now thought as in night of the living dead ( 1968 ) . at only about an hour in length revolt of the zombies still feels too long . technically the film is ok considering it was made 70 years ago , the black & white cinematography is adequate although some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photo of the background location . the acting is wooden & largely unimpressive . revolt of the zombies might have been hot stuff in 1936 but it has n't dated well & in 2005 it 's an absolute chore to sit through . i believe the film is now public domain as it turns up on lots of ultra cheap dvd compilations & budget labels , but it 's still not worth watching no matter how cheap you can get it for .
ok , if you 're a woman who 's got aggression issues , you might like this movie . hate your significant other ? this movie is for you . for the guys , it will be a bag of laughs . it 's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies . the only really good part is the last 10 seconds . even that was a load of cheese . my wife is picking the worst movies lately . this is what you get ( i ) for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites .
sadly imdb does not allow me to rate judges lower than 1 . what a shame . this ghastly movie is so bad that i actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending . the script had a few bright moments , but the directing , editing , acting , audio quality , and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make judges utterly unbearable . judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western , but in reality was nothing of the sort . what it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe . you can try to pretend it is okay , but it just keeps on stinking . why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me . we rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television . but judges is worse than the most pathetic scifi channel original . i intend to demand my money back from hollywood video .
when i looked at this years wrestlemania 's match card , i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement . it starts ... and it ends . i 'm sitting there , angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back . i mean , you watch wrestlemania 22 ( one of my favorites ) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then . the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out ! ! ! ! that very moment of hbk losing to john cena ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! john cena is such a loser/poser . it almost ruined wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat triple h ! i could n't watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania 23 . i 'm starting to watch it again ( luckily ) . i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania 24 ( the greatest i have ever seen ) which was a pure classic wrestlemania . it definitely made up for 'mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well . if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one , like the ones that turn you into fans ( wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan ) , please do n't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind . and if you do watch it and are angry , start watching it again and watch wrestlemania 24 , it is absolutely classic .
when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there . getting there i found too predictable , contrived and slow , and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins ' worst . however , while when in rome is n't a terrible movie , it 's not a great one either . if i had to sum it up in one word , i would say passable . it is good fun for teenagers , but i think adults wo n't find much to go on . when in rome does have its good points . mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses , certainly very pretty as well . i will admit when i was 10 or so , i really liked them , and in general i kind of like them still . and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute . back on target , both girls do n't do that bad a job , in fact they are very appealing . plus their outfits are to die for , and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking . the soundtrack ai n't half bad either . however , where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script . the script is on the most part clichéd and has hints of deja vu . the plot , like most of the mary kate and ashley movies , is very predictable , and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins ' work , will find some rather unoriginal elements to it . most of the characters are cardboard thin , and you do n't learn very much about them , and sometimes the pace is uneven . sadly , the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work , that looked rushed constantly . all in all , does have its good points , and certainly watchable . however , for my taste , it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff . 4/10 bethany cox
this movie was extremely depressing . the characters were so cold . the mother , who is he main character , is everything but `` motherly '' . ok , she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first . her husband dies . she then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him . until this part , the movie is all right . not excellent , but it can be watched . the guy is charming and who can blame her ? ok it 's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter 's lover but let 's blame that on the shock of losing her husband . she becomes totally obsessed with the guy . i think this is the part where i started to dislike the movie . she 's always there wanting to please him in an `` old fashioned way '' with snacks while he is working on her son 's house ( i guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do ) , as if it was the only way she could get his attention . the guy obviously is not very interested ( actually , it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity ) and instead of being insulted by that , she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive . `` i want to please you '' , she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly . what outraged me in this movie , is the utter lack of self-respect the mother has for herself . she tells craig something like `` i am just a shapeless lump '' the first time they sleep together . this movie is an insult to women kind . if it had been me , i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain ... : )
i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently . in my opinion , the film started out decent enough , but eventually got sour . the story : a u.s. soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u.s. has sent out to troops for christmas . he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life , a motivation to continue on . when he is given leave , he goes to the very town that the woman lives in . he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card . he meets the family and after saving her dad ( a vietnam war veteran ) from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street , the family decides to take him in for a while . we learn that he does n't have a family back home . the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company . the family comes to love him and vice-versa . the soldier also becomes in love with the family 's daughter - the woman that sent the christmas card . there 's only one problem . she already has a serious relationship with a man that she 's in love with . it 's also a long distance relationship . the boyfriend is very different from the soldier . he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors . the woman prefers the latter . throughout the rest of the film , there is a `` love triangle '' as the woman 's boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season . everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what 's best for her daughter . * * ( spoiler alert ) * * the woman comes to like the soldier more and more , as they have a lot in common . they happen to spend a lot of time together . she gradually becomes attracted to his persona . then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back . now she 's so confused ! she 's in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday , but she 's become so fond of the soldier . soon enough , the boyfriend ( who does n't know about the kiss , but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her ) decides to propose to the woman and she accepts . his plans for their marriage , however , are not plans that she wants . she wants to be at home , have kids and be close to her family . he wants to travel the world , go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along . this does n't sound too thrilling for the woman . however , the soldier feels bad about what he 's done and does n't want to make things worse . so , he decides to leave town , despite the dad 's urging him to stay and be with his daughter . it all comes to a head when , at the christmas eve service with church , we find out that the soldier has n't left yet . the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he , broken-hearted , basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her . the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together . things i like : i like the soldier throughout much of the film . he 's basically nice and polite , with a strong sense of doing good for others ; there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes ; the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table ; the dad and mom have a long-lasting and evidently healthy marriage ; the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong things i do n't like : there is a very typical `` love triangle '' story in this film ; the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend ; most of the family practically applauds this behavior - the family goes with church and participates in services , yet this is how they act ; there is some bad language conclusion : i became disappointed as the film ran on , and it got worse and worse . i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough . so , the film started out decent with some few gem moments , but ended up ruining itself . therefore , i do n't recommend this film to anyone .
this became a cult movie in chinese college students , though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4 , uk . full of arty giddy pretentions , the plot is mediocre and unreal ; the 'spirit ' it wants to convey is how independent artists 'resist the commercisliation of music industry ' and maintain their ' purity of an artistic soul ' and wouldnt 'sell themselves for dirty money ' . that is really giddy and superficial ; the diologue are mainly pathetic . acting is poor . sceenplay is full of art pretention . it is a fantasy movie for kids and that ; s all
as with many other pop-culture franchise series , this line just did n't know when to quit . instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended , they went on to generate this ; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark . this movie should never have happened . it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line , and it sure shows . the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same . after the wonderful experience which was the omen , this was a major disappointment which stank of 70 's cheese and horrible acting . it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects , and left a terrible , lingering stench long after it was over . it rates a 1.4/10 from ... the fiend : .
i watched mask in the 80 's and it 's currently showing on fox kids in the uk ( very late at night ) . i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears . i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was . it 's just plain awful ! it is no where near in the same league as the transformers , he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made . i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses 31 comes on straight after it ( that 's if mask does n't put me to sleep first ) . one of the lesser 80 's cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids !
not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews . while watching `` bang '' one night on tv , i found myself bored by the nonsensical , random plot which was occurring on screen . the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless , artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker . the fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness . those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say , more entertaining than this complete waste of time .
although i had some hopes for this film , particularly since i enjoy the acting of jason segel ( freaks & geeks , undeclared ) so much , i must say it was one of the worst films i 've seen in recent memory ( loser and dr t and the women are also on that list ) . yes , there were a couple of laugh out loud moments , although the movie could have been so much better . the premise was not bad- scam artists cheating their way through college meet their match when they 're discovered by someone with a proposition for them . the problem is that the characters were all so unlikable , that i did n't care about any of them . the blackmailer ( played by talented jason schwartzman ) was such a psychopath that it was n't that funny to watch him- he was n't deranged in a particularly funny or charming way , he was just a crazy loser , who was actually rather dangerous and not fun to watch . the editing of the movie was hard to follow -- it kept cutting between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was which . only two or three of the gang 's scams were really shown , you just had to take it on faith that they were indeed scam artists -- showing their schemes would have made for a better movie . the so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable , in fact it was silly and poorly written and directed throughout . i could go on about the movie 's shortcomings , but you get the idea . not worth the $ 4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent !
joe don baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there ... he was alright in goldeneye and made a pretty good bond villan in the living daylights and has appeared in various other movies . one thing he ca n't do is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in malta . joe don 's partner is killed so he kills the killer 's brother and escorts the killer to italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in malta and the killer gets away . the rest of the movie is seeing joe don chase the killer here and there , joe don getting taken into custody various times , joe don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . the movie is quite bad and you wo n't find yourself exactly pulling for joe don 's character . you will be amazed at how many times joe don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be . the crowning part of the movie comes when joe don chases the killer all over malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around malta . this movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever .
i ca n't quite say that `` jerry springer : ringmaster '' is the worst film i have ever seen . the film would be better off if it were , because at least the worst film i 've ever seen , ( prom night ii ) interested me enough for me to hate it . my only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when i looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed . it had seemed much more like years . it is an endless repetition of poor people , ( or what jerry springer seems to believe poor people are ) , screwing each other , hitting each other , insulting each other , and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing . the plot , which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the jerry springer mill , advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters . this makes it impossible to care what happens to them . it never mattered to me whether they got on the show , or what they said , or who slept with whom . maybe i 'm not supposed to care about them . maybe i 'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type -- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny . too bad it is n't . the humor is not outrageous . it 's innocuous . it 's predictable . humor has to have something behind it , some kind of painful irony or life experience , in order to function . scatology is not wit . an example . a mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed . to take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter 's boyfriend . since i was over the shock of jerry springer 's show a long time ago , i had the same reaction i had to andrew dice clay 's obscene nursery rhymes ; not laughter , just yawning . lastly , i found springer 's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing . if he really were an advocate of the poor , he would bring on a single mom from bed-sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in new york city on $ 12,000 a year . or , failing that , he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits . jerry springer gets millions for his shows , his movie , his book and videos . his guests just get round trip air fare , hotel accommodations , and a chance to humiliate themselves . if he liked poor people so much , he 'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him . it appears that springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself . jeez , with all his fine work , you 'd think he 'd have earned our respect already . anyway , the film is weak and boring . it does n't even succeed at being offensive . if you want to have a better evening , videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that .
i initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of silent hill . being a huge silent hill fan , and disappointed with it 's movie debut , i thought i would give this one a chance . mind , fearnet only lists this movie as `` dark floors '' , not by it 's full name . so when i saw the name `` mr. lordi '' in the credits i immediately thought of the band ( i had a few friends in college that like them ) but did n't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside . the film starts out strong . despite the fact `` creepy little girl '' has been done to death , the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together . the tense atmosphere built rapidly , and every indication pointed to the film being excellent . as monsters are the true stars of horror , i could n't wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in ... and then the first monster showed up , and i found myself greatly underwhelmed . by the time the second appeared , i boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a megadeth concert , and the silliness turned me off completely . over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact , and the story left you wondering just what was going on , but the scares were pretty much non-existent . however , i held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile . unfortunately that was not to be the case . by the time the movie had reached it 's climax , i was in utter disbelief , and i immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal ... the lead singer of lordi ? seriously ? was that what the movie all boiled down to ? a bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by lordi band members ? the silly monster design suddenly made sense . if you 're going to be that corny , may as well through the members of marilyn manson , or even kiss in there too . not to mention the fact that i 'm pretty sure i saw the ending in one of lordi 's music videos a few years ago . they had to go and make an entire movie off of it ? worst of all , when i found out what really had been going on , all i could manage was a yawn . i 'm not going to `` ruin '' it for you , but i can safely say it 's probably a plot device you 've seen before . most likely more then once . so , unless you 're a huge lordi fan , stay away from this . it 's not scary , it does n't bring anything new to the table ( although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies , mainly silent hill ) . and , i ca n't stress this enough , lordi is the antagonist . lordi . talk about a buzzkill . really , you 'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching slipknot music videos . in other words , it 's just not possible .
in case you 're a self-acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie-making , there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch `` attack of the killer tomatoes '' . it 's an inescapable certainty , as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made . one tiny but essential detail , however , is that `` attack of the killer tomatoes '' is deliberately awful . right from the opening message already , mocking alfred hitchcock 's `` the birds '' , this is clearly intended as a zero-budgeted parody and i ca n't escape the impression that writer/director john de bello never expected for his film to become such a hit . the film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so-called `` eco-horror '' movies ( plants , animals and nature in general revolting against humanity ) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines . a secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato-attacks coming from all over the country . the president puts together a special forces team to battle the juicy enemy , which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices . the first half hour of `` attack of the killer tomatoes '' is very entertaining . as silly as it is , the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny . the first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song , the `` jaws '' homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash ( see the trivia section for more details ) that made it to the final cut . after that , however , the whole thing turns into a tedious , unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess . the quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots . personally , i prefer the late 80 's and early 90 's sequels ( which i saw before seeing the original ) because they benefit from slightly better production values , incredibly over-the-top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor john astin ( `` the addams family '' ) as the mad scientist dr. gangreen . but , as said before already , the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life .
i just have to add , in case anyone actually reads this and has n't completely gotten the point yet . these other reviewers are n't joking around , this really is the worst colour movie you 're likely to ever see . when the movie started i could n't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see . they 're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie . it really does . like the `` director '' took the family hi8 camcorder ( before dv cameras and computer non-linear editing ) , no other equipment ( lights , sound gear , etc ) , grabbed some decent-looking acting students , and went out to shoot a movie . no script , just making it up as he went along . when i watched it , it was on my mono tv , so i only have one channel of audio ( left of right speaker ) . at first i thought i 'd hooked it up wrong . the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in . i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then could n't hear the dialog . they recorded the sound on different bloody channels ! i mean , there 's movies that can be funny to watch , so bad they 're good , kind of thing . i 'm not sure this is one of those . i mean , i 'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker . and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better , you know . but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it . as bad as they were , the actors are the only good thing about this . i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene . a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 . but alas , no . if you want to make a movie but it 's turning out crap , throw in some gratuitous nudity . worked for roger corman .
i gave this movie a 5 out of pure pity . my intention is not to burst anyone 's bubble , because i 've seen , as i 've skimmed through other comments , that this movie is quite appreciated by many . well , it is not worth any praises , and i say this because i 've seen the original anime , basilisk , and this movie shames it deeply . perhaps if you see shinobi alone , you could like it . it is enjoyable due to the well-choreographed battles , based on fantasy more than on martial arts , and i agree that their beauty is deeply enhanced . but the story is nothing like the original one . now , i understand that when one transforms an anime/manga into a movie , one must make certain changes . i was not expecting to see the freakish characters from the anime , although they have a well-established role , and some are truly profound and well-designed . but i certainly did not expect to see immense and wrongly-placed changes , that basically ruin the entire story . characters who are dramatically and unethically mutilated , transformed in something the public might love more , perhaps . for instance , oboro , who , in the anime is a sweet , innocent girl , completely and utterly in love with gennosuke , becomes a vengeful clan leader in the movie . i liked the fact that the woman becomes strong and evades the limitations imposed on her by the era ( we are talking about japan , 17th century ) , but her mood changes are unbelievable and badly written . hotarubi , which is one of my favourite characters in the film , but who is not known for her childish and sensitive nature , becomes a pathetic little girl who is not only not madly in love like in the anime , but is more or less worthless in the plot . i could go on and on , like how they made tenzen , the worst and most dangerous character in the anime , exceptionally weak and unattractive , or how gennosuke , the leading character seems completely misplaced and confused , not to mention , again weak . the music is beautiful and the image is astounding , which was expected of a japanese movie , and i appreciate it for that . but do not watch this if you 've seen and enjoyed basilisk , because it is just hopeless . basilisk , although based on fantasy , with elements of horror and largely exaggerated is splendid and has so much more depth in its characters , storyline , historical value and it is , may i say , heartbreaking . shinobi was a waste of time and i could not believe it kept on going after what was supposed to be the climax . alas , it pains me deeply to judge a movie so harshly , but i advise you against it . please , watch the anime , or at least watch the movie first and then repair your image of what basilisk really is by watching the anime . otherwise you will have a seizure when you realize how they 've massacred it .
i always felt that a good film should have a plot . this particular film was missing one , and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot . this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever ; i was anxious for it to finally end . however , i just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long ; it felt like four hours . not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict . it 's not the worst movie i 've seen , but i used to say that it was until i saw `` the fast and the furious '' . so , do n't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action . i actually hate most action films out today ; it 's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum . not much really happens in this movie . however , the scenery and costumes were nice .
i fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching larry sanders ( i usually directivo it , but not last night ) . woke up at 3am ( invesment banker on the west coast ) , and was fascinated to see this on hbo2 . i was shocked on how poor this 'movie ' was . seriously . shocked . so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb . this is really really bad . the writing is boring , but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school . yes it is shot video . mind you , that is shot on video , not digital video . it does look like a soap opera . the clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film ' feel to them then this horror . i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything . the shots and blocking are stupid . yes , i chose the word 'stupid ' . not unconventional , not daring , not bold , not boring , just stupid . i know people reviewing this review will say `` well give me an example '' . i cant . it was 3am . but trust me , i know you will watch it anyway , you will be drawn by the horrible reviews .
i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap . what a waste of time . beverly d'angelo and william katt ? wtf ? were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or something ? truly , a piece of unfunny garbage . the characters were stereotypical without meaning to ( i think ... ) and wooden , most of them seemed like they were on autopilot . the so-called `` hilarious '' situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed , i weeped for the writers . i 'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time , seriously . i 'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 , it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock .
every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks `` what 's with snitch 'd '' ? i know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror . you see , i was the cinematographer on the film . let me clarify some points regarding this `` interesting life experience '' . originally , snitch 'd was called one hard hit . i met james cahill in july of 1999 , a day after i wrapped triangle square , a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades ... it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag 's notorious experimental feature contract . but i digress ... i though i was on a roll , and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000 , not wanting to break pace , i took it . after all , clerks , el mariachi ... i too believed the myth back then . let 's just chalk it up as `` film school '' for many involved , myself included . snitch 'd was shot over two weeks in august , 1999 , in aliso viejo and santa ana , ca . cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city ( yes , he is a drama and english teacher ... consider that while watching the film , or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ) , hence the locations and cast . of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l.a. 's channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez , and of greater impact , the debut of eva longoria , who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt . i must say her professional dedication , focus and `` let 's do this '' attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come . snitch 'd suffered from poor optics , few lights or electricity , several boom operators du jour , and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication . none of that overshadows the actual content , which speaks for itself . anyway , by 2003 , the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss , i understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box ( by then she was a rising , working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch 'd . since cahill 's other passion is antiquarian book dealing , it appears to confirm he believes you can , in fact , judge a book by it 's cover ... as so many have picked up this dvd based on it 's sleeve . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - one year later , eva , now on a soap , and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted , split second , which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent . 6 years later , i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez , mexico . i though he had worked out the process ; my participation was contingent on casting , script and crew control , and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies , for what it was ... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez ; despite claims here and elsewhere , the film has never appeared in any festival or venue , although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject , virgin of juarez and border town .
the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute . other than that , this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it . jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual , but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly . the plot makes no sense , the dialogue is dumb , and there are numerous smaller faults . but the dog is cute ...
turkish cinema has a big problem . directors are n't interested in global cinema . they are local and folkloric , but want to be international . this brings kitsch results such this movie . film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they do n't have any meaning for non-turkish audiences . even for turkish audiences after 10 years . players , even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average . they act like puppets . movie was shot in cuba , but nothing includes about cuba . so cuba is thought like a banana republic . waste of money , waste of time .
the motion picture was , in all likelihood , made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 . i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era . nevertheless , this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak . also , gary cooper was probably just learning to act . the result is something that would not be acceptable by today 's standards . for 1931 , maybe . for 2004 , not acceptable . some of the actors performed well . sadly , the indians always get the short end in these early westerns . they were living on the land long before the white man came , but according to twisted history , they had no right to defend themselves .
this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i have to disagree with another commenter , who said the special effects were okay . i found them pretty bad : it just was n't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story . maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story . the archaeologists are looking for `` the set '' . they do not bother to tell what set , or what is so special about it . that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california , while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt . if you 're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert , take the effort to actually go to the desert . the beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert . the action-level was constant throughout the movie , no ups and downs , no climax . it made the movie look short , and that 's certainly a pro for this particular movie .
ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town . there , he will fell in love to martina , the most beautiful girl in town . they will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of ulises at the sea . some years later , martina has married to sierra , the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money . one day , the apparition of ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences . the plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part . in addition , three quarters of the film are sexual acts , which , still being well filmed , are quite tiring , as we want to see more development of the story . it is just a bad bigas luna 's film , with lots of sex , no argument and stupid characters everywhere .
caught this on ifc yesterday , and ca n't believe the positive reviews ! am i the only one who thought these `` ladies '' were anything but ? kate tells jed she could get fired because she 's supposed to be a pillar of the community , but puts out for him ! then they suddenly decide they 're in love ? and she 's so devastated over his death , she does n't go to his funeral , much less , tell his family the `` good news '' ! by the way , how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school ? janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power , but nothing happens ! and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning ! and the less said about molly , the better ! as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed , please ! it 's the punk 's own damn fault he got turned into roadkill ! where 's the guilt over poor gerald , who gets puked on ? if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this `` movie '' !
a stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients . despite an initially hostile response , he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor . and , as the doctor shows him about , he talks and talks and talks ! ! ! and as he talks , loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive . while there is some action here and there ( and some of it quite disturbing ) , it 's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is -- lacking life and energy , which is odd for a horror flick . even a guy who thinks he 's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome . the further this tour takes the guest , the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers . yet again , despite this twist , the film is amazingly lifeless in many places -- particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set . only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell , starving , does the film have any real impact . considering this plot , it sure is hard to imagine making it boring , but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have ! now with the same plot and competent writing , acting and direction , this could have been an interesting and worthwhile film . you know , now that i think about it , this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original `` star trek '' tv show ! you know , the one with `` lord garth -- master of the universe '' and kirk and spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers . a final note : the film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene , so be forewarned -- it 's not for kids . in fact , considering how worthless the film is , it is n't for anyone ! however , with the version included in the `` 50 movie pack -- chilling classics '' , the print is so incredibly bad that it 's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark .
here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film , a sub-genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so . i 've heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies , including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie , and as much as i hate to be redundant , the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything . the punch bowl over poor jeremy 's head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie ( ` hey everyone , this is the director , and the following is my carrie-rip-off scene . enjoy ! ' ) . but that 's just a suggestion . ( spoilers ) the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured . we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning , she gets killed , people wonder in the old oh-but-that-stuff-only-happens-to-other-people tone , and then they start to get killed . the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful , but they have no idea how to do it . take jason , for example . here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had , and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated , he is assumed to carry some significance . besides that , and more importantly , he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade , and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine 's day cards . it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects , and jason is a perfect example of the effort , but not such a good example of a successful effort . sure , i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer , but that 's not the point . we know from early on that he is terrible with women , which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film , but then in the middle of the film , he appears at a party , smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls , and then gives them a hateful look and walks away , disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation . we already know he is a cardboard character , but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him . on the positive side , the killer 's true identity was , in fact , made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also , unfortunately , yet another rip-off . early in the film , when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel , he makes no sound , suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female , rather than a male as everyone suspects . but then for the rest of the film , we just have this stolid , relentless , unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife . director jamie blanks ( who , with all due respect , looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade ) mentions being influenced by halloween . this is , of course , completely unnecessary , because it 's so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film . the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer 's is that michael 's mask was so much more effective and he did n't have a problem with nosebleeds . this stuff is shameless . at the end , there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is ( complete with slow and drawn out ` and-the-killer-is ' mask removal ) , but then we see adam 's nose start to bleed as he holds kate , his often reluctant girlfriend , and we know that he 's been the killer all along . nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act , and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film . valentine is not scary ( i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight , and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember , and even i was n't scared ) , and the characters might be possible to care about if it were n't so obvious that they were just going to die . i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews ( although the film was in and out of the theater 's faster than battlefield earth ) , but the end result is the same old thing .
where to start ? ! . . . i feel ... violated ! thats right , violated ! i just spent 1.5hrs of my life , 1.5hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful , like watching paint dry , on this so called horror flick . its not scary , its not funny , its not dramatic , its no action , its nothing ... its predictable , its boring , its tragic ... i might come of a bit harsh here , but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no , do n't watch it ... unless you want to feel violated also .
upon viewing tobe hooper 's gem , crocodile , in 2000 , i developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre . i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness . if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts . with ed writing the scripts , and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer , all we 'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants . while tobe hooper 's crocky opus referenced his own movies , blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies . see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages ? /rip-offs to jaws , temple of doom , indiana jones ' last crusade , the convent , godzilla 2000 , and any james bond movie . also , try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock . i was disappointed the crock did n't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism ... or crocky appreciation , but the quasi-captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach . perhaps , in the coming years , we 'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset . or hopefully , a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-g monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed . all-in-all , the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me .
i could not , for the life of me , follow , figure out or understand the story . as the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible . i 'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story/plot problem that never got sorted out . the producers could never separate the many details that the novel , or any novel , has the time and space to create from the other idea , which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer 's pursuit by the police . they ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit . too bad really because they had a solid cast , a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography . in fact , a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours .
`` when a small bavarian village is beset with a string of mysterious deaths , the local ( magistrate ) demands answers into ( sic ) the attacks . while the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires returning to the village , the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes , '' according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis . an inappropriately titled , dramatically unsatisfying , vampire mystery . curiously , the film 's second tier easily out-perform the film 's lackluster stars : stoic lionel atwill ( as otto von niemann ) , skeptical melvyn douglas ( as karl brettschneider ) , and pretty fay wray ( as ruth bertin ) . the much more enjoyable supporting cast includes bat-crazy dwight frye ( as herman ) , hypochondriac maude eburne ( as aunt gussie schnappmann ) , and suspicious george e. stone ( as kringen ) . mr. frye , ms. eburne , and mr. stone outperform admirably . is there another movie ending with a mad rush to the bathroom ? magnesium sulfate epsom salts it 's a laxative ! * * * * the vampire bat ( 1933 ) frank strayer ~ dwight frye , melvyn douglas , maude eburne
granting the budget and time constraints of serial production , batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any `` cliffhanger '' list , utterly lacking the style , imagination , and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor , batman . the producer , sam katzman , was known as `` king of the quickies '' and , like his director , spencer bennett , seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement . ( unfortunately , this team also produced the two superman serials , starring kirk alyn , with their tacky flying animation , canned music , and dull supporting players . ) the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come : thoroughly inane titles ( `` robin rescues batman , '' `` batman vs wizard '' ) , mechanical music droning on , and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around , either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks . batman 's cowl , with its devil 's horns and eagle 's beak , fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes . his `` utility belt '' is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments , from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments ! in any case , the lead players are miscast . robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne , and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman . he creates the impression that he 'd rather be somewhere , anywhere else ! john duncan , as robin , has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue . he is too old for the part , with an even older stuntman filling in for him . out of costume , lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink , without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serial . although serials were not known for character development , the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast . this one offers a group going through the motions , not that the filmmakers provide much support . not one of the hoodlums stands out , and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever , `` the wizard . '' ( great name ! ) actually , they are led by someone sporting a curtain , a shawl , and a sack over his head , with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing . the `` prime suspects '' -- an eccentric professor , a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying . even the established comic book `` regulars '' are superfluous . it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne . despite the perils she faces , vicki displays virtually no emotion . commissioner gordon is none-too-bright . unlike in the previous serial , alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is `` mr wayne 's residence . '' they are props for a drawn-out , gimmick-laden , incoherent plot , further saddled with uninspired , repetitive music and amateurish production design . the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom , the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel . the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing . ( the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet ! ) pity that the filmmakers could n't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure . while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious `` batfan , '' one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box . they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combined . now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version !
this is the worst , and i mean the worst computers based movie i have ever seen . the whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity . i mean ... the guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person . now you probably think this must be some super cool high-tech computer , well , it is , but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface . and the main idea how to overload the `` super '' computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid . my mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer cant decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games . there are also some other bad things about it but i just do n't have time for this . i just cant believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
can you say `` all shock , no plot ? '' there were so many unexplored directions in this movie . there was no history about the room other than the deaths . * why * was it evil ? what made it that way ? why an `` hour '' countdown ? then , there were the unexplored things hinted at ; for example we * saw * a camera in the air vent , which he mentioned . but when he climbed up said vent , there was no camera . how about the fact that all the ghosts looked `` digital '' , and things `` winked out '' before hitting the ground making a static noise ? hmmm ... when you put all of * those * things together , it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech spook house . except that there was no follow up on that . oh ... by the way ... electronics do n't work in 1408 . well , except for the tv ... the cell phone has no signal , but wireless internet works fine . how many incontinuities can you possibly add ? i 'm sorry , but this film was nothing but `` shock after shock '' . it 's all been done before . reflections in the mirror . things just out of site . changing paintings . bleeding walls . the `` oh , it was all just a dream ... no it was n't . '' and , if the room was `` evil '' , why make our main character come to terms with his daughter 's death , if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway ? it just did n't make sense . additionally , there was no background information about `` the first book '' that he wrote . just some vague information about the `` dad was a jerk '' and so forth . speaking of dads , what was with the bit about his father ? `` you 'll be in my place '' . overall , a truly horrible movie . it was 100 % adrenalin shock factor , without any new or innovative effects , and certainly no back story , character development , etc . my overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the `` cheap '' ; pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots , and was nothing but an effects film of recycled , cheesy , `` seen-that-before '' effects .
vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past . 'waqt - the race against time ' and 'namaste london ' were entertaining and interesting to watch . 'singh is kinng ' was fun , which he produced . his latest outing as a filmmaker 'london dreams ' comes up as his careers weakest fare . 'london dreams ' has a mediocre storyline , it 's about how success turns friendship into hatred . agreed , it has the potential but when you watch 'london dreams ' you wonder what 's happening ? this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times . vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down . the first hour is boring , the second hour is better ; but again the climax is horrendous . how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you ? i wo n't . ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy , thanks to his uncle om puri . when he reaches india , rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco ? was vipul shah 's intension to show salman 's character as a god ? if yes , than you 've failed completely . the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that , would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception ? write what you feel , do n't fool us { the audience } , we are sensible enough to understand what 's good or not . this is a musical but the music by shankar-eshaan-loy is terrible . not a single song stays in your mind . salman is superb though . he carries the film on his shoulders and does really , really well in the emotional scenes . but again his character is shown as a god , which makes him look like a retard in the end . ajay is equally good , but salman has over-shadowed him completely . asin is wasted , and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film ? rannvijay hams , though aditya roy kapoor excels . brinda parekh is alright as the vamp . on the whole , this dream remains a dream !
you 've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication , drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making : between 1985 and 2000 , he made a whopping 34 films . unfortunately , if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by , they 're probably all crap ( and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch ) . part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead , who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school . working from a dreadful script by brian eklund ( which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb ) director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast , dreadful visual effects ( some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle ) and his trademark shoddy gore ( handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims ' clothing ) . finally , after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives , and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards , zombie armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film . honestly ... once was enough , mr. sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again ?
tony scott directs a thriller sports flick that should attract even the non-sports fan . and some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn slow . well perk up ! on the outside he appears to be a disgruntled salesman ( robert de niro ) while on the inside he is a psychotic san francisco giants fan . along comes a new slugger ( wesley snipes ) and designated savior from the doldrums . our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the giants are feared to crumble along with him . de niro is terror personified . snipes seems very natural as the ballplayer . other notables in the cast are : the still attractive ellen barkin , john leguizamo , benicio del toro and patti d'arbanville . you are a free agent ... so enjoy . violence and very strong language is to be expected and you get your moneys worth .
tell the truth i ’ m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people , which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie . and after having seen it , i was really a disappointed , and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie . i ’ m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid ’ s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing . i ’ m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account . synopsis : the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior . there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak . just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all . they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done . the story is very predictable ( though expected ) and the humor is lame . and haven ’ t we already seen the same characters ( play by mc lovin ’ ) in so many other movies ( like sasquatch gang ? ) . i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep . well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay . and the acting is so-so as expected when you ’ re watching this type of movie . and the direction , what do one expect ? this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer , and that movie also sucks . but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie . anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time . only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie . can ’ t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone . pros : elizabeth bank ? two topless scenes . cons : not funny , dreadful story , nudity and kids do not mix together . rating : 3.5/10 ( grade : f )
it 's interesting at first . a naive park ranger ( colin firth ) marries a pretty , mysterious woman ( lisa zane ) he 's only known for a short time . they seem to be happy , then she disappears without warning . he searches for her and , after a few dead ends , stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past , which may include criminal activity . and then , it seems the filmmakers did n't know what to do with the story . the beginning , while not as suspenseful as it sounds , is at least watchable . then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense . and the ending is so lame , so dull , and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence , you 'll think the screenwriters did n't know what to do with it and got bored trying . what a sorry waste of a good idea !
there is one good thing in this movie : lola glaudini 's ass ! sorry to be so blunt but it 's the truth . too bad she did n't do a nude . it would at least have made this mess tolerable . we see another chick 's boobs but she 's nowhere near lola . and man , is armand assante old or what ? the man looks like crap ! `` consequence '' is the usual b-movie you would expect . the story had potential . it 's like they had good ideas but did n't know how to execute them . the cinematography is just plain awful . ugly ! the directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors . lola gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap , slutty way but not even she saves `` consequence '' from being trash and not funny trash , just plain old stinking trash .
wow ! i did n't know that someone would make this movie ! its awful ! i have written down 5 things that can tell why u do not want to see this movie . number 1 : `` its the biggest rave ever '' where is the that rave ? i could only see a few people dancing around .. 2. when they are on the rave , they can only see blood everywhere , no people , two ruined tents and one stage .. and what do they do ! ? they drink ! 3.the worst actors i have ever seen ! the captain and his crew .. awful ! 4. when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun , he shoots almost 30 times without reloading ! 5. i did n't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro ! must be a new thing .. i wonder what the producer was thinking ! `` this is going to be a big hit , its gon na be a classic '' .. sure u dumb s * * t anyway do n't see this movie , its a waist of time . my eyes are still bleeding !
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... i tend to support everybody , because their efforts are worth ... but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits ! imagine the following situation : 1. think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far . 2. think about some great , attractive art for that movie 's dvd box ... and a promising plot ... 3. voilà ! you got zombie nation . see it only if you really do n't have anything else better to do . anything is better .
i was very skeptical about sacrificing my precious time to watch this film . i did n't enjoy the first one at all , and the last jean claude van damme film i liked was blood sports ! after managing to sit through it all ? avoid , avoid , avoid ! !
i wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on tv . i went to tinsel town to see it last night at 7:40 . i regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when i could of saw something better . the beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches . they exaggerated the way love works in reality . all of the girls were stereo types . the boyfriend was too stupid for his own age . the passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs . the bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies . their getaway car was an old beat up chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . hey why did n't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead ? it might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie . this movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed . this movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive christian people nuts . hey i even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but i but there was never any . so i rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars .
of all the movies i 've seen , this one rates almost at the bottom ( haunted mansion , nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom . ) it is hasty , the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted . of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer 's door . the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous , and illogical . oprah gives a palatable appearance as `` bigger 's '' mom , but is not nearly at her potential . other famous performers also seem to be at their worst . the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur . in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted . one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk . now the family he 's working for are not against blacks , but he thinks they are . so when he comes home he puts her to bed , but she begins caterwauling . the blind mother ( yes ) hears this , so bigger tries to silence her , but instead smothers her . now fearing he 's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do -- he shoves her into the coal furnace . so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace ( the idiot did n't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes . he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom . if your desperate for a bad movie , this one could do the job , but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40 's and 50 's or see a good drama , there are a lot better options . avoid this .
i just do n't see how a concorde-new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad . it just boggles the mind , does n't it ? well , let 's make no mistake about it . `` munchie strikes back '' is indeed a bad film . munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries . for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film , he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son . the mom 's problem ( her main problem at least ) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks ... to the not-so-tiny tune of $ 20,000 . ouch . she ca n't come up with the money because she just got fired . ok ... just is the key word in that sentence . what the ... ? was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck ? maybe it would 've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ... ya think ? munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess ... but there is n't a limit on the number of wishes you can make ! munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was `` borrowing '' it from . the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating . a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times . sadly , those dumb parents watching the game do n't think it 's at all strange . hmm . anyway , i 'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is . you 'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie-anne down , playing the mother , kicks a dog which is yapping at her . your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer . `` munchie strikes back '' 's credits promised another film to follow entitled , i believe , `` munchie hangs ten '' . to date , the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force . heh . 1/10
i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 ( back when the tickets actually sold for $ 1 ) . this is the only film i have ever walked out on ( with my friend , while the idiocy that is the `` laser bra 2000 '' sketch was on screen ) . evidently , my and my friend 's reaction to the film was a common one . it is not that i found the film offensive ( either as an 18-year-old or now ) , but rather that it is mind-numbingly stupid and patently unfunny , devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable . this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it , rather than a failure to comprehend mr. mike 's `` vision '' ( unless , of course , his vision was to drive the film 's backers into bankruptcy ) . i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published `` 10 worst films of all time '' list . it certainly makes mine . you have been warned .
`` whipped '' is 82 minutes long . this review is 82 words long . three unlikable new york lotharios , ruthless `` scammers , '' end up wooing the same woman , played by amanda peet , with disastrous results . that applies to the story and the film . too sophomoric to be misogynistic , flaccid and ridiculous , `` whipped '' mixes the philosophies of shock jock tom lykis with penthouse letter fantasies . though technically proficient it 's dated , grating , poorly written , mean , and obvious . people do n't act like this . people do n't talk like this . really .
steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources . to pick on the technical flaws - silver f/a-18s and f-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike , and miraculously become camouflaged f-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves . suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe , which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro . putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu .
the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line , because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no-budget station . `` man behind the gun '' is a typical early 1950 's period melodrama with pre-wwii production values that relies on a historically-topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script 's complete absence of character development , and thus lack of suspense . in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like 'gunsmoke ' , 'bonanza ' , etc - and these actually did the job better . randolph scott , looking particularly grizzled in this , is the good guy , struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail . there 's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling , unless you count wondering whether he 'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end . the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the 'characters ' than the acting is . but it 's fine if that floats your boat ; and i would n't berate you for enjoying 'diagnosis , murder ' , either . workmanlike , pedestrian , and ageing rapidly . 3 stars for being competently put together ; 0 for artistic endeavour .
i do n't often give one star reviews , but the computer wo n't let me do negative numbers . the opening titles tell us we 're in deep water already . although this is a low budget exploitation film , there are 17 producers credited . no . no . at the beginning of the story abusive husband kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community . the house is a pigsty . his wife , della ( kim basinger ) has let the children run amok all day . ok. we 're already in deep water . ms. basinger was 55 years old when the film came out . uh , are these her children or grandchildren ? it 's christmas eve . della drives to the mall , a lengthy scene that could have been cut . to bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on christmas eve . sure . for a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it . we get some actual suspense in the driving scenes , though . it 's raining and traffic is bad . first we see della try to drive and smoke at the same time . then later della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time , at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone . she wanders the mall , sees an old friend from college , tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh , maybe her husband is grumpy because he 's going broke , but that 's too complicated for the script to follow . in the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films . one white boy ( lukas hass watching his career go down the toilet ) , one black , one asian , and one hispanic . imagine a company of up with people gone to the bad and you 'll have the idea . although they have a gun she gives them attitude . a mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head , firing more than once . the parking lot is crowded as can be , people everywhere , and nobody notices . della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area , she drives to a construction site , where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools ( literally ) at hand . major spoiler ahead . she drives back home . the car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain . checks on the children , goes downstairs , and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range . the experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for della . instead we know that her children will probably spend christmas in foster care or a group home , because the state will collect them while she answers to murder one charges . the four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense . the husband , different story . i 'm so glad i saw this on cable . if i 'd seen it in a theater ( did it get any release ? ) i 'd have been furious . as is , i 'm just sad seeing talents like ms. basinger and mr. haas waste themselves on garbage like this . one very good thing , though . this was written and directed by susan montford . ms. montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd . there is justice in the world .
i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission , and let me tell you , you 'll watch anything under those circumstances . not this piece of sh * t though . the first five minutes set the tone by weak porn-movie quality acting , weird out-of-the-blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior . it gets worse after that . this movie does not have one single saving grace , and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch . it 's just horrible . i 've seen quite many movies in my life and i 'm not one of those snobby know-all critics , i mean i 'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they 're bad . this one ... man . steer _well_ clear of this one , my friend .
this film is just a shame . orlando , florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area ( like vancouver 's rise to prominance ) . the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area ( which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon ) . i will try to be as honest as possible . i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers . it had the potential to give a new spin on the 'boy band ' craze . after all , both n'sync and the backstreet boys come from this area . but , the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script . both lead characters are flat with almost no development ( part of this could be the amatuer actors , but some of it is certainly the way the script was written ) . also a problem is the choice of jokes . many of the jokes are too repetitive ( they do come off funny the first time , but it does grow to be a bit boring ) . some of the 'concert ' scenes are staged poorly ( and many of these scenes also do n't seem to move the story along in any way ) . i had high hopes for this one , but alas its a disappointing effort . i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short . but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres ( quickly ) . comedy is n't his strong suit . but , its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area ( its just a shame that right now he 's infamous , not famous ) .
well this is the first post am ever commenting on imdb. , do you get it , this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop ever experimenting with movies . as most of them have given their comments i thought of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors ( though having read worst critics against this movie ) i thought of experimenting it assuming it to be some comedy flick. , well it all started well with some ahem. , comedies .... then it all started going pathetic ... man you can believe your self , you wud feel like going and banging your head each and every time the pathetic looking woman called the heroine of the movie is made helpless ... huh~~ well how much can a person digest a sick all possessive witch kinda ghost trying to do all she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing . the next worst thing about the movie is , the `` zombie '' hero , yes as he looses his fiancé he roams around like a goat , with black marks under his eyes. , and with the hero 's `` terribly stupid '' sister .. you wud be bleeding from head to toe if you attempted and succeeded by completely watching this movie~ !
i 've never been to paris , but after seeing `` paris , je t'aime '' i 'm crazy to visit this city ! i 've been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs . i kinda expected to be touched by this film , to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away , but , lo and behold , i regret the time and money i spent with it . there are no love stories between people or a person and the city . there 's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just does n't work out fine . maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city , where it 's said to have thousands of people living on their own . ca n't you find love in new york ?
from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws . the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father 's considerable wealth and power , and he is struggling to both fill his father 's shoes and cut the apron strings mother ( and co-executive ) keeps too tight . he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry . there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later , such as his friendship with his surgeon ( terrence howard ) and his romance with a middle class girl ( jessica alba ) . uncreative story lines , but not bad enough to ruin the movie . the only real `` oy vey ! '' moment was the name of lena olin 's character . overbearing woman named lilith ... subtle ! the surgical scenes are not at all censored . i appreciated that , people who find surgery scenes scary might not . the horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first . you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader . the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia , he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him . the big twist , however , is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he , like us , initially missed . there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother . one is an impressive gesture by olin , which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing . the other is a secret about the family 's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless . the initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama . there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat , taking the entire movie with it .
this inferior sequel based by the characters created by david selzer and harvey bernhard ( also producer ) concern on a matrimony named gene ( michael woods ) and karen york ( faye grant ) . they adopt a little girl named delia from a convent . gene york about re-elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee . meanwhile , delia seems to be around when inexplicable deaths happen . she creates wreak havoc when goes a metaphysical fair , as stores of numerology , therapy , counselling heal , yoga , tarots , among others are destroyed . karen york hires an eye private ( michael lerner ) to investigate the weird and bizarre events . this tv sequel displays thrills , chills , creepy events and gory killing . delia such as damien seems to dispatch new eerie murder every few minutes of film , happening horrible killings . the chief excitement lies in watching what new and innocent victim can be made by the middling special effects . furthermore , mediocre protagonists , faye grant and michael woods , however nice cast secondary , such as michael lerner , madison mason , duncan fraser and the recently deceased don s davis , he was an army captain turned into acting . as always , excellent musical score taken from omen i and iii by the great jerry goldsmith . the movie is exclusively for hardcore followers omen saga . the motion picture is badly directed by jorge montesi and dominique othenin girard . previous and much better versions are the following : the immensely superior original 'omen ' ( gregory peck , lee remick ) by richard donner ; 'damien ' ( william holden , lee grant ) by don taylor ; 'final conflict ' ( sam neil and tisa harrow ) by grahame baker . rating : below average .
the thing about calling `` house of the dead '' the worst movie of all time is that it 's really not . there are worse movies out there . i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called `` a movie . '' house of the dead is however one of the worst films i 've ever seen at the theatres . walking out half way through , i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through 45 minutes of this piece of garbage .
years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me , the atmosphere of the movie was first class , the acting memorable and the storyline a classic . recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part 1 again i looked eagerly to viewing part 2 ...... i was so pleased to realize early on into part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie , again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii ........ wrong ! , i wish i 'd stopped at ii . the storyline was not good , it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story , the characters were weak especially the daughter . pacino 's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather 1 or 2 . then scenes such as , corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir , the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset , the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting ( where the 'goodies ' get away and everyone else is shot ) , daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board , the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes ( a man of his intelligence and guile is n't ready for an emergency ? ) ... no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again . but i 'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years .
i gave this movie a rating of 1 ( awful ) . the only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is ben kingsley , who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way . mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply ca n't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece . stupid , stupid story and horrible production . do not waste your video rental $ .
mr. vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football . unfortunately , it did n't make the goal . the historical subject of giants is a good one , but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese . i say , take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff . i could n't even watch the entire film . that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie . i always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption . it 's impossible to redeem something this bad . well , at least the acting was good .... not ! the only thing `` falling '' in this film is the rating . 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers !
the russian movie , `` 4 , '' follows the lives of three ( not four ) strangers who meet one night in a local bar . one is a musician , one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl . `` 4 , '' i gather , is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia ( the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are ) , but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities , selling decades-old frozen meat etc . - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody 's really up to here . despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes , `` 4 '' is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .
gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes . i love 50 sci fi , i even love cheesy 50s sci fi , but this film is really , really bad . and not in a mst3k kinda way . virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best `` hip cat '' impression of abott & costello . chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi , such as in `` cat women on the moon '' but it ca n't in this case . this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature . that said , i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so .
elfriede jelinek , not quite a household name yet , is a winner of the nobel prize for literature . her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads . am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes ? 'gobble , gobble ' is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey . in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception . 'gobble , gobble ' and the piano teacher are perfect partners . the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film can not be overstated . it begins very badly , as if made to annoy the viewer . credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes . we are introduced to professor erika kohut , apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress , a stony professor of piano . she lives with her husky and domineering mum . dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action . reviewing the piano teacher is difficult , beyond registering its unpleasantness . what we see in the film ( and might read in the book , for all i know ) is a tawdry , exploitative , nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on . erika , whose name is minimally used , is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed . not quite , because there 's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies . if a reviewer has to ( yawn ) extract a leitmotif ( why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do ) , elrika 's violently alternating moods would be it . a young hunk , walter , studying to become a 'low voltage ' engineer , whatever that is , and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments , is also a talented pianist . he encounters elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be paris . in the glib fashion of so much art , he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme ' . repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography , shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches . walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika , whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness , hostility , discouragement and humiliation . he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex . erika retains control over her lovesick swain . she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges . in the meantime , chillingly jealous because of walter 's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert , erika fills the student 's coat pocket with broken glass , causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands . the next big scene ( by-passing the genital self-mutilation , etc ) has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother . erika want to be humiliated , bound , slapped , etc . sensible walter is , for the moment , repulsed and marches off into the night . at this point there 's still nearly an hour to go . the viewer can only fear the worst . erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice . they retire to a back room . lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers . his 'baby gravy ' is soon expelled with other stomach contents . ho hum . repulsed but hooked , perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor , walter returns to erika 's apartment . can you guess what happens now ? it 's not very deep or difficult . yes , he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim . one moment he 's locking maman in her room and slapping erika , the next he 's kicking her in the face , having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love . am i being unfair in this summary ? watch the film if you want , but i 'd advise you not to . anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they 're in the right mood . i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted . but i 'prefer not to ' , because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing . i 'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love , ineffectively seeks it in pornography , inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears , pink and throbbing , under her nose , belatedly realises that she does n't like being hurt , blah , blah , blah . the world has , for reasons not explained , stunted her . she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist , because that 's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise . at the end , if you have the patience to be there , there 's a small twist . before going to the final scene , where she 's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands , erika packs a knife in her handbag . for walter ? yes , you 're ahead of me . she stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves . roll credits . if this earned the second prize at cannes , just how bad were the rest of the entries ?
i hired out hybrid on the weekend . what a disappointment ! a stupid lame attempt at a tele-movie . the guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running { he did a lot } looked like he was eating those minty sweets ... with his backside ! the wolf contacts he wore were great , though i feel the actor relied on them too much , as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all . the wise native american indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen . talk about a sour cow ! she smiled about once for the entire film , and i think that is because she had sex . the sex scene was lame too . they may as well have shown blowing curtains , if you can dig that . last of all , and this is a big pet hate of mine , on the cover and the dvd menu , the losers digitally drew in cool sharp teeth on the guy . they were nowhere to be seen in the film . : (
there are bad movies , then there are the movies that are so bad , that they become almost art . this is one of those films . my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked , you know , staring off into space and drooling ! you can tell that the people involved ( i hope they changed their names to protect themselves ) were having a blast , and they definitely were n't shy . i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and really bad gore effects . i laughed out loud during most of the movie , so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time . beware viewer , the above words in no way construe that this is a good film , because it is not . all i can say in my defense , is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title !
jason alexander is a wonderful actor , but it 's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead . the fact that he dances so well , croons so effectively , and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy . in his more cutesy moments ( with the girl in the train station , in the final number with rosie ) , i could n't take my eyes off him he was so repellent . you keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling . vanessa williams was the real star , the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie . by the way , if you see a production of the stage musical , the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie , you 'll see three versions that have more revisions ( different songs , same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations ) than any other musical i 've ever seen .
this is a film where the actors are all fine , especially brigitte bako and erik palladino , in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion . in other words , it feels like they are contrived movie scenes , not like real life . even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers , it just does n't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film . also , when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film , it feels artificial , the way they look at each other seconds after arguing . again , the actors are all good , and moments of this film are nice , but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling .
have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before ? that happened to me with `` the young graduates '' . the cover of the video box , if you can find the video , is extremely deceiving . i 'd swear that the two women on the cover are n't even in the film . anyway , i was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or ... it is simply pointless junk . i 'm heavily leaning toward the latter but i guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie . hmm ... plot . a plot . let 's see ... there must be a plot around here somewhere . nope , i ca n't find it . it 's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago . one of the female students has a crush on her teacher . the teacher has a frigid wife ( whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg ) so he is receptive to the girl 's advances . there 's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing . our cat , booboo , was transfixed by the dancing high school kids . she watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor . it 's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic . 1/10
charlotte 's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it 'd be otherwise.the story is so poor and charlotte 's character dies in such a foolish way , that you wonder if this 's the ending they had thought of for this movie . i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists , but i fear it does n't . as for the rest of the cst , well i 'd say they simply did n't act very well ; although the blame should be put on the poor script.this movie reminds me of rush hour 2 where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way , since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie . i could give this movie 2/5
when i finally had the opportunity to watch zombie 3 ( zombie flesheaters 2 in europe ) on an import region 2 japanese dvd , i was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.the transfer is just about immaculate , as good as it 's ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it.the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.the sound is also terrific.it 's only 2 channel dolby but if you have a receiver with dolby prologic 2 , you can really appreciate the cheesy music ( actually a very good score ) , and the effective although cheap sound effects.it never sounded so good , and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment . i never realized just how much blood flows in this film , it 's extremely brutal with exploding head shots , exploding puss filled mega pimples , a cleaver to a zombies throat , a woman 's burned off extremities ( how come it did'nt burn the guy also ) , intestinal munching , zombie babies and so much more i lost track . this is no doubt for hardcore zombie action fans , especially of the italian kind.there is some excellent set pieces and cinematography to be found , i think people do n't give it enough credit , if you see a clean print , and not some horrendous pirate copy , it 's a whole other experience entirely . this film never lets up for a second , and i realize it 's inconsistent plotwise , the dubbing is horrible , the acting is stiff , and it 's sense of irreverence is celebrated in grand fashion , but that 's part of it 's charm . to me this is one of the best horror films ever made , you ca n't make a film this bad , so good , on purpose.it 's accidental genius of the highest order.if they played it for laughs it would have been a disaster , but they played it straight as an arrow and the result is a terrific cult classic that thumbs it 's nose at any and all traditional moviemaking standards . tons of action sequences , exotic locales , excellent set design , good , sometimes great cinematography , wonderfully cheesy acting , and inconsistent but still interesting plot , great makeup effects , beautiful women who can kick butt , excellent music , and sometimes hilarious , sometimes creepy , but always entertaining zombies.how can you go wrong with this film , it has it all , a cult classic that stands the test of time .
what a terrible film . it sucked . it was terrible . i do n't know what to say about this film but dinocrap , which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass . ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! sigh .. it 's not roger corman that i hate , it 's this god-awful movie . well , really ? but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics . which is another thing , the cgi sucked out loud ; i hate this movie dreadfully . this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b-movie , and probably the gayest b-movie too . it's-it 's -- - dinocrap ! i 'm sorry , i must have offended some nerds in these moments . it 's just an awful movie ... 0/1,000
who wrote this ? some guy named john cohen . i guess this was the first screenplay he 's ever worked on . someone should 've told him you 're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say . and who directed this ? scott marshal ? son of gerry marshall . my the nut has fallen far from the tree . someone might have wanted to let him know that you can , in fact , shoot a scene in a cab in new york , and it will look real , and you wo n't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason . might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson , but hopefully he 's learned that lesson now . and jessica simpson ... naturally she ca n't act . hell , she makes jessica alba look like audry hepburn , and yet she 's starring in this movie . oh wait , it was produced by her father . okay , that 's why she got the part . that 's really the only reason i can think of . so should i be surprised it 's bad ? no . should i be amazed at how bad it is ? i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did . i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad , but this ... it 's not just bad , it 's the complete opposite of a classic film . think of a great woody allen movie , this film is as bad as that film is good . it 's the anti-annie hall . i am so glad i did n't pay to see it , i stopped watching ten minutes in cus i could n't go on . no doubt i would 've walked out of the theater sooner . in fact i wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing . the film starts out laughably bad , and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture . and then , around when the first act is ending , you realize it 'll only get worse , and that 's when you either need to leave , or kill yourself . in conclusion , this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at guantanamo bay . although some prefer the water boarding .
horrible waste of time - bad acting , plot , directing . this is the most boring movie ever ! there are bad movies that are fun ( freddy vs. jason ) , and there are bad movies that are horrible . this one fits into the latter . bottom line - do n't waste your time .
alien hunter : 5 out of 10 : is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell , new mexico suck . take alien mixed with the thing , mixed with contact , mixed with of all things on the beach , the andromeda strain , the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot . derivative does n't even begin to describe this movie . of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right ? nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease . ( james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join him . he turns her down . aggh ! ) in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it . i mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke . with about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure . needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title . i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif . ( note that since jason of friday the 13th fame , pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield ? ) the characters in the cornfield dress like logan 's run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them . that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant . the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear . john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it . alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie .
i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story & good actors but mismatched , and i would also say rushed . it has been about 24years since i read the book as it was in school . but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out & therefore it does n't fully make sense . for example jane & mr rochester have hardly spoken & suddenly he is proposing marriage ! ! ! the actors do n't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story.the actors are good but are n't given enough time to do this story justice . i 'm sorry to say it but i did n't really enjoy this version.the 1970 version with susanna york & george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my preference but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke & timothy dalton in the 2 main roles . i love it so much i watch it regularly.there is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins .
i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean , hongkong or even china . strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film . i do n't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as i am , in fact , a fan of indie movies . however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace . i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going . the acting certainly does not make it better . rainie 's acting is sub par as she 'over-act ' , trying to be perky and cute . although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at . isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused , sad , regretful , extremely reserved character . overall i find this movie is a disappointment .
someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to high noon . now that is a real stretch ! i 'm a big sinatra fan including some of his acting roles but maybe the only person who could have played this part would have been don knotts . first off , as someone pointed out , sinatra just does n't have the build for a western bad-guy wannabe . he 's just too 'slight ' at this point in his life . maybe he was about the same height as say audie murphy , but murphy had a pretty solid build . sinatra comes across as the big talking little kid who nobody ought to take seriously . the story is uninspired and really not credible . i do n't want to spoil it but i think the ending and how the townspeople react in this story does n't make any sense . another thing , these people constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy ' . this is just a little town , so i do n't get the attraction nor do i understand why the people would let themselves be dominated that way . there is a 'love interest ' in the story and if i followed it right , she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so some other bad guy would n't kill him . now there 's true love for you . 'stand up for yourself ! tell him your name so he will kill you ! ' lol . stop , you 're killing me . unfortunately the basic premise of the movie is n't good enough and no matter how they tried this story did n't have a logical path to follow other than into the wastebasket . want to know why it 's not on video and never shown on tv ? the critics apparently panned it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad . i would almost bet sinatra paid someone to deep six the thing as much as possible . you want to see a good western where a town stands up against a bad guy ? try tension at table rock , or at gunpoint - two really , really good westerns with that theme . johnny concho is johnny stinko . frank , you were the greatest singer ever - but you did n't belong in a movie like this .
to call a movie like `` thinner '' bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore un-talented . no news , but how they got that way is what people want to know . as far as this movie .... the book was good , even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the `` be careful what you wish for '' genre . burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father ( constantine from tv 's `` room 222 '' ) to several pounds a day . like i said , it starts out good , but why involve the mobster ( mantegna ) ? why fire automatic weapons so much ? why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx ? i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes , diseases , death , gypsy lore and such . but no , it 's not to be . remember , this is stephen king we 're talking about . and the ending ... almost the same as the book , but a little too talky . in fact the whole movie talks too much , feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us . not that i expected `` the dead zone '' , but i could have done without another `` pet sematary '' , thanks anyway . one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job . however , the rest of the movie is left to be ... say it with me ... `` thinner '' .
man , even plan 9 from outer space is better than this movie . this flick does n't have enough plot for half an hour , yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour . jet li and corey yuen are pretty good , specially in those exaggerated fight scenes , but stuff like the legend of fong sai yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade .
i hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired . the only high points are a few of the supporting characters , 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season ( and one of them was a cat , to put that into perspective ) . the whole storyline is centered around sex , and nothing else . sex with vampires , gay sex with gay vampires , gay sex with straight vampires , sex to score vampire blood , sex after drinking vampire blood , sex in front of vampires , vampire sex , non-vampire sex , sex because we 're scared of vampires , sex because we 're mad at vampires , sex because we just became a vampire , etc . nothing against sex , it would just be nice if it were a little more subtle with being peppered into the storyline . perhaps have a storyline and then shoehorn some sex into it . but they did n't even bother to do that ... and anna paquin is a dizzy gap-tooth bitch . either she sucks or her character sucks , i ca n't figure out which . another part of the storyline that i find highly implausible is why 150 year old vampire bill who seems to have his things together would be interested in someone like sookie . she 's constantly flying off the handle at him for things he ca n't control . he leaves for two days and she already decides that he 's `` not coming back '' and suddenly has feelings for dog-man ? give me a break . she 's supposed to be a 25 year old woman , not a 14 year old girl . people close to her are dying all over , and she 's got the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her v-card to some dude because she ca n't read his mind ? as the main character of the story , i would 've hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in , not someone you keep secretly hoping gets killed off or put into a coma . i ca n't find anything about her character that i like and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not the least bit interesting . i will not be wasting my time with watching season 2 come june .
i watched peter jackson version of lord of the rings when i was half way through reading the two towers and i thought it was absolutely brilliant . at this time the animated version of the lord of the rings was released on dvd but i told myself that i will finish reading the two towers and return of kings before watching it ( as i thought it showed the whole of the trilogy ) . so when i did finish the trilogy i went and brought the dvd , which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish . i was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because i love the book and i am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film . none of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page , even my favourite character who is gandalf did not seem interesting at all . the animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks ( they looked awful ) and aragorn and sam face . i do n't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending , but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film could n't of got any better . i just hope that nobody judges the books by this film . 3/10
let 's see ... i 'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything , so what kind thing can i say about the pallbearer ? i know ! the performances were -- no , that wo n't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from gwyneth paltrow , usually so vibrant , and ended up creating caricatures out of carol kane and barbara hershey ... oh - how 'bout the story -- nope . that is n't gon na fly either , as it was doze-inducing . what was the genre anyway ? it was n't funny , that rules out comedy . it was n't interesting enough to be dramatic . was that a romance between schwimmer and paltrow ? i have to ask , as i ca n't be sure - let 's just call it `` losers in like . '' i 'm sure those behind this film started with a vision , i mean , they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits , but i need help finding it . even if i were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story , i could n't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy , fluffy , stupid hair . speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by hershey ? what am i doing ? i already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie -- i can not devote any more time to this loser .
despite unfortunately thinking itself to be ( a ) intelligent , ( b ) important and ( c ) interesting , fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly . the script makes little sense , the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite , and john lydon shows us all , in the space of one movie , why he should never have let himself out of music . his performance is one-note and irritating . the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn . his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act , but mercifully his performance here is restrained .
... cause they 're both pretty lousy . i think the best part of the movie is the horrendously imperial picture of faye dunaway at the top of the stairs . she looks like she could very easily step out of that picture , rip someone to bloody pieces , and calmly re-enter the portrait looking as if nothing had happened . now , you know a movie 's in trouble when part of the set furnishings manages to attract your attention . i admit , i paid $ 30 for the dvd just so i could see faye dunaway in a contemporary horror movie . i know what you 're thinking -- 30 bucks right down into a gaping black hole . and you would be absolutely correct . this movie sucks . there , it 's right out in the open . i was expecting some actual scares , and i waited and waited and waited . none came . the raven ( probably a crow in makeup ) did n't scare me , seeing small pieces of internal organs did n't scare me , and even faye did n't scare me . i 'm not that brave , i know , so it must be the movie itself that is the trouble . what 's more , jennifer was n't scared either . her internal organs were literally falling apart and she seemed more peeved than anything . her life was rapidly coming to a close and she 's worried about attaining more money . honey , you ca n't take money where you 're going ! ! ! `` i need money , '' she continually says , completely ignoring the fact that her lungs have collapsed and ceased to function . meanwhile , i spent the whole blasted movie wondering what was up with the grandmother ( faye ) . i was suspicious at first , faye playing a grandmother and all , and i was still suspicious at the end . there is another relative living in the house that jennifer and mary ellen the grandmother-from-hell are forced to share temporarily , and i 'm guessing she is of the same generation as said grandmother . here 's the weird part -- the relative looks like she 's just endured her eight hundredth birthday party . mary ellen looks like she 's just gotten a face-lift from a renowned surgeon . face-lifts ca n't work miracles , but i think faye 's appearance is important to the rice-paper plot . spoiler ! ! ! it seems that the family is plagued by an illness that affects bad acting ... sorry , my little joke . seriously though , there 's all illness that causes their organs to fail and ultimately disintegrate . yuck , huh ? interestingly enough , mary ellen is still alive and all her organs are intact . how did she avoid the family curse ? something 's up with her , obviously . another reason for mourning the loss of my thirty dollars -- this movie features one of my all-time movie pet peeves . i refer to the double ending . this movie ends twice . i absolutely hate it when that happens , and in this movie it feels like the director shot the ending , did n't like it , and forget to remove it during editing . i guess it 's supposed to be scary , but it is only if you 're a film editor . there is one perk to this debacle , though , and it 's one of the reasons i bought the dvd . the `` filmmaker '' commentary features faye dunaway , and i wanted to see how she acted when she did n't have lines to recite . guess what -- the movie sucked so bad i was n't able to sit through it again . drat .
flat , ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account . nicole kidman plays the deceptive tracey , married to the doting andy ( bill pullman ) . when an old school friend of andy 's named jed hill ( alec baldwin ) turns up as the resident surgeon , trouble is not far behind him . script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective , tantalising thriller , and the severe lack of character motivation , background and development leaves the whole show reaching . none of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters , especially bill pullman , whose own inexplicably curious andy is impossible to believe . poor director harold becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project , and is unable to make entertainment from any of it . by the time the 'secret ' of the plot is revealed , you just wo n't care . at least the cinematography has massachusetts looking good . also stars george c. scott , peter gallagher and josef sommer . sunday , february 25 , 1996 - t.v .
i ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews , on the request of a female . just out of curiosity , i thought , let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie . i am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it 's a scam . as far as my opinion goes , i have to ask , '' are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded ? '' the movie is atrocious on so many levels and i 'm not even talking about the story or presentation . so , these bunch of guys plus one girl ( the lead actress ) form a music band ; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a rock band . hell , when did dancers started becoming the part of a rock band ? ? ? anyway , let me accept it as the-bollywood-version-of-a- rock-band , but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool `` rock gestures '' and i am assuming they were playing the instruments , the sound of the guitar was completely missing ! ! ! i simply ca n't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here .... i am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie . bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i could n't help but think of behind the mask : the rise of leslie vernon ( a massively more amazing film ) when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea . this could have been a great film . the acting is ... from some of the actors alright . from others ... it 's downright horrible . that aside the idea is great and the format is great . the story is pretty good as well , though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind . nevermind that though right ? it is a horror movie after all . i really want to see this remade ... i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be . however ( and you ca n't really fault the minds behind the movie for this ) this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget . and the fx really hurt the film overall . great movie . ... if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx . whoever wrote it should keep going though , great idea here .
i really wanted to like this movie . it has a nice prison setting , conspiracy theories , bloodthirsty zombies , a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor john saxon , who also plays a bad ( you guessed it ) a bad guy . it reminds me of some ( beloved ) italian horror flicks . but the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there . it just goes on and on and on , and then it ( logically ) has to end . more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed .
i am a christian ... and i feel this movie is awful . nobody but hard-core , bible-belt christians are going to like this movie . the message is just too in your face . if you want to touch a wider audience , you have to be way more subtle . you ca n't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in every scene . ridiculous ! poor direction . the reveal of people missing should have been terrifying , but it was laughable . they leave their clothes on the ground ? it reminded me of old ed wood movies : `` oh my god ! people are missing ! '' that scene in the plane is just stupid . think about it : if you found your relative 's clothes next to you , you would n't just scream `` oh my god . they disappeared ! they 're missing ! '' and start crying and yelling . you would first be in denial ... you just would n't jump to that conclusion . watch jodie foster in flightplan . my favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him . i about fell off the couch i was laughing so hard . the music was so bad and so distracting . it was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies . `` here 's my chance to do a thriller '' , `` here 's my chance to do action ! '' stop telling me how to feel james covell ! a good score supports what 's happening on the screen ... this movie needed more of an under score , but instead it was as much in your face as the message was . the writing was bland . so was captain christian kirk cameron . chelsea was the worse : `` you do n't understand ! people are missing ! '' . brad johnson was laughable . the two stand out performances came from the anti-christ and the older guy ( sorry , ca n't remember their names ) in watching the `` making of '' ( to answer my question of `` what were they thinking ? ? ? `` ) , the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves ... saying `` we 're gon na reach wide audiences '' and `` brad johnson is amazing '' and `` this is just like a hollywood movie '' . i came to the conclusion that they just do n't know what the `` heck '' they are doing . i commend the effort . getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea . film is the best medium possible to do that . look at movies like wide awake , signs , contact , passion of christ , even o'brother , where art thou ? the bottom line is that the film needed to be made by people who have talent and vision . unfortunately , it was not .
... ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet , and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was . and i could n't have been more agree about it . then after that i saw this film on dvd , i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv . luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap . i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film could n't make me satisfy . so i ca n't be judging on how the film was made , but anyway ... it still sucks . as for those who liked this film , i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is . i do n't know what do you think about this film ?
this reboot is like a processed mcdonald 's meal compared to ang lee 's very good but very underrated 2003 `` the incredible hulk '' . ang lee 's `` the hulk '' is a comic book movie for the thinking person . the hulk takes some time to appear ( about 40 minutes ) , but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist 's core . he does his best to avoid losing control , but as he admits , when he does give in to his rage , he likes it . now compare this to edward norton 's turn , where there is no display of conflict in his personality , and he turns into the hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute ( not 183 , not 197 , but exactly 200 ) . to this reviewer , this felt akin to the introduction of midi-chlorians in the phantom menace , which tell how strong the `` force '' is with one , as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test . in the 2008 movie , all ed norton 's bruce banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 , as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist . and for the record , it is extremely difficult to get one 's pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run , especially for a physically fit person . emotions drive eric bana 's hulk . he has repressed memories of his mother 's death and his father 's role in his early life . on the surface he is calm , but there underneath there is significant anger , enough rage to fuel the hulk when it is unleashed . but the hulk never kills intentionally , even his attackers . mostly , he just wants to get away or close to betty ross ( jennifer connelly ) . he incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene , saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision . in the 2003 movie , the visual effects are there , but as necessary . the action scenes ( and there are plenty of them ) are necessary to the plot , unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action . in his quest to turn it into a `` fugitive '' story , ed norton loses focus on how bruce banner feels about the hulk . to him , the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry . and louis leterrier , the director picking up on ed norton 's cue , fails to add any emotional dimension to the banner-hulk relationship . the story can be summed up as : banner is pursued and hulk kicks butt , banner is pursed and hulk kick butt . repeat as necessary . the only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version . however , even as i am a fan of the comics , i would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy 's dream but has heart over the comics-loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day . perhaps ang lee should have read more comics . iron man , also released in 2008 , is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic-book roots and has heart .
this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver 's license . it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars . such things as dune buggies , drag racing , custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed . it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull , drawn out and even sexist at times . none of the people in the film are actually heard . instead , everything is done in narration and voiceovers . sorry , but i ca n't stand that . there is nothing educational or interesting about `` dad , can i borrow the car ? '' . it 's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their `` wonderful world of disney '' tv show . 1/10
there 's no denying the first azumi film was a commercial product ; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young , attractive actors and certainly was n't lacking in the budget department . yet it more than entertained for what it was , and i ca n't deny i enjoyed it immensely . `` azumi 2 '' lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful . the first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb ryuhei kitamura at the helm . with him , he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics , but the originals style , beauty and most importantly , its heart . while the first had a simple `` hitlist '' plot , this one has a corkscrew mess of a story , with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated . gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters ; azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest . characterisation is non existent ; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies , i 'll be shocked . the same applies to the villains here . the final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension . the fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness . the villains themselves try far too hard to be campy , and even if they were all combined , they do n't come within a country mile of the pete burnsian antics of jo odagiri in the original . # # # # major spoiler at end of paragraph ! # # # # # aya ueto tries her best it has to be said , and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films . azumi is now a fully fledged assassin , meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion ; unfortunately , now the character is instilled with a sort of man with no name style mysteriousness , ueto 's model looks become even more inappropriate . i know this is supposed to be the point , but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film , the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around . the less said about chiaki `` remember me from kill bill '' kuriyama 's performance the better ; it suffices to say her `` turn '' from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm . overall , this was just a colossal disappointment . any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film . a lazy , unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess .
children love dinosaurs . it 's somewhat part of their culture . but they 've got the land before time . the original . at least that movie had heart . this . this movie is just plain pathetic . just because kids love dinosaurs does n't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children . this movie has no plot , the whole premise is stupid , and it 's more by the numbers stuff . not as soul sucking as theodore rex , but it 's lightyears away from being a land before time .
this is n't cinema . it is n't talent . it is n't informative . it is n't scary . it is n't entertaining . it is n't anything at all . i got this because my cousin says , `` diablo ! cool ! '' yeah , right . the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i did n't buy it but rented it instead . it 's shot like a bad soap opera . no wait . soap operas at least look professional ... sorta . this ? this looks like it was shot with someone 's camcorder . it 's horrid ! wretched ! it sux . the cinematography is detestable ! who is this director anyway ? i do n't even care enough to look him up . he stinks ! the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap-fest deserved . 2.6/10 on the `` b '' scale . that registers about a 0.3/10 on the `` a '' scale from ... the fiend : .
i 'm afraid that i have to disagree with the majority . i found spike lee 's latest a wee bit boring ! although he was trying something different , i.e . not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer , i do n't think it worked too well . there 's really a bit too much going on - vinny ( john leguizamo ) and dionna 's ( mira sorvino ) relationship , ritchie 's ( adrien brody ) lifestyle and then the local mafia types . the story is good , but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories . with such a provocative killer could mr lee not have put more into that side of the film ? > there are some good points though . all scenes with the 'son of sam ' killer david berkowitz look very nice ( colour saturation etc ... ) and the acting is pretty good throughout . overall i felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings . it just was n't strong enough in the end .
the plot of 7eventy 5ive involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly ( to them , if not to fans of horror ) gets them in over their heads . the story of 7eventy 5ive , on the other hand , is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise , sadly outweighed by really bad writing . what could have been a fun , if somewhat silly , old-fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers ' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud , whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film 's running time . with the exception of a police detective played by rutger hauer , ( in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie 's only star power ) every character on screen is a different breed of young a-hole . male and female , black and white , straight and gay , an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film 's narrative . worse , since the tale deals with a party game gone awry , most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b * * * * * ds . because of this , there are few breaks for the viewer , who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly-drawn protagonists . even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends , invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner , long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen . this leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film : the audience , intended to care about the leads , instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer , but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier . the real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7eventy 5ive actually did have some potential . visually it 's fine . first-time directors brian hooks and deon taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood . they also manage to deliver on some competent , if sparse , moments of classic 80s-style gore . surprisingly , the production 's cast is also fairly able . it is n't that the actors are n't capable of expressing realistic human emotion ; it is simply that the screenplay ( co-written by newcomer vashon nutt and director hooks , who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard ) is short of such moments . 7eventy 5ive can hardly be recommended , as its familiar premise and few thrills ca n't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters . in this tepid whodunnit , the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who ca n't even manage to like each other .
boring . minimal plot . no character development . i went into this movie with high expectations from the book . it could have been an awesome movie . it could have probably become a cult classic . nope , it was a giant let-down . it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects . it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys : the rebels or the military or the church or all of them ? i am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie . i am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called `` prophecy '' , which is never really fully explained . i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel . it seemed very much like a made-for-tv movie . do n't go see this movie . it is a waste of time and money .
this movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the coppola family . it does n't seem to know whether to be an `` a '' or a `` b '' western . i mean , the hero is called hopalong cassidy for god 's sake . william boyd must be spinning in his grave . all the `` b '' western cliches are here . the two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed ( `` c'mon thunder '' ) , the all-in-black bearded villain , the heroine in distress , the rancher in trouble , the cowardly sheriff , over the top bad guys etc . the acting , with few exceptions , is strictly from the yakima canutt school of acting . chris lybbert ( who ? ) as the hero and louis schweibert ( who ? ) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30 's poverty row quickie . the addition to the cast of veteran performers martin sheen , robert carradine , clu gulager and will hutchins helps a little , but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one . what was the point of the martin sheen/robert carradine framing sequences ? are we to believe that the sheen character was a ghost ? what was the purpose of the black gloves ? it just did n't make sense . being a great lover of westerns from all genres , i tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film . the cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic . aside from the hero and main villain , the other characters looked authentic . if the producers were going to resurrect the hopalong cassidy character , they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul-mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder , the kind of part lee marvin would have excelled in . what else can i say but .. on thunder , on big fellow .
this was my first , and probably the last angelopoulos movie . i was eager to get into it , as it featured mastroianni , one of my favorite actors and was a film by theo , of whom i 've heard a lot . the opening was promising , a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the albanian-greek border . ok ! but that was all . nothing left . the movie had big holes and i do n't know which to mention first . the main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman . during a long walk . it 's like a 15 minutes monologue , killing the action and viewers patience , nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes , apart this old lady telling a story . all that is presumed to be shown through action , was simply told to the camera by the old lady . in a moment , the equippe of tv was heading to the bar . they turn the corner and immediately the winter begins ! probably , shot in different days , continuity leaked . a lot of problems with the story-telling , it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style , making the viewer asking questions that never got answers . poor mastroianni , given a role which lacked integrity or charm . on the other hand , as many greeks or albanians or balcan people would agree with , the movies showed lot of historic , ethnic , or politically incorrectness , just for the sake of making a movie about `` humanity '' as a red in another review . a lot more to say , but no time to lose on a poor movie , which was not movie at all , but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money .
do n't see this movie . bad acting and stupid gore effects . a complete waste of time . i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks , instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you , the watcher . disgusting . the murders are pretty lame , basically strangulation . one woman he stuffs worms in her mouth , one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her . btk = btk broiler , burger king 's `` killer '' new sandwich .... ha ha . i do n't think this movie relied too much on actual facts . i mean , he real btk killer did n't carry around a bunch of rodents , scorpions and worms .. and oh yeah ... a slaughtered cow head too . go figure .
it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any `` gray matters '' will agree that this movie just does n't work . the problems lay in the direction , cast selections and lack of depth in the character building . the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used . let 's look at the problems in direction/script . brother and sister both in their mid 30 's seem to be well adjusted . they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer . he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him . then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week 's time ? ? ? ? hello does anyone feel stupid yet ? he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her . not only was there no chemistry it just does n't make sense . sure it 's a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could , but the direction made it completely flat . now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan ( very shallow character ) kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there . i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather can not act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role . this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew . it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction .
great mystery , but the film goes down hill from there . the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer , edward . he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills . a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter . so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman . they do n't like outsiders . a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl . that made the movie too long . it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward . overall , not a well written story and too long . final verdict : i would skip this .
doc savage : the man of bronze is a horrible movie . poorly scripted , over-acted , and just plain silly . that being said ... it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level . this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer . it 's one of those movies like `` santa claus conquers the martians '' or `` yor , the hunter from the future '' ... so bad it is almost good . if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch . it 's campy . it 's fun . it has a theme by sousa . if you 're looking for a good movie though , look elsewhere . 3/10 . btw , i 've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake ...
the thing that really gets me about this movie ( that is , the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill ) is that someone actually paid to have it made . there is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie . it is not frightening , it is not thought provoking , it is not entertaining , it is not good . it is a sleeping pill made of cyanide . the dvd case compares it to blair witch , evil dead , and a few other decent movies , making the filmmaker 's desperation glaringly obvious . it is nothing like any other movie ever made ; it is far , far worse . the claims of an `` extremely shocking ending you will never forget '' are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings . please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash , because it may make you sterile . the man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the writer 's guild membership list , and never allowed to film anything again . because if he thought this was a movie worth making , he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future . zero stars . may grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this . i am going to go vomit now .
jack frost , no kids it 's not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man . it 's about a sadistic killer named jack frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid and is morphed into a killer snow man . i happened to catch a copy of this movie so i could have a nice sit back and laugh at it . a killer snow man ? ha , sounds like the perfect comedy/horror movie ! well i was wrong , very wrong . jack frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight . but it 's a snowy night and it collides with a government tanker carrying a new dna fluid . jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and morphs into a killer snowman . he returns to the small town of snowmonton where he was caught by a small time sheriff . here he is ready to kill again , now as a snow man with cooler powers . he can condense into water , shoot out ice cycles as spears , and grow killer fangs . the only question is , who can stop frost ? this movie is below the typical b-movie line . the movies begins cheesy but as soon as jack is burned by the acid , it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat . the acting for one is appalling ! here we have a whole cast of unheard of actors who either ca n't act , can act but has a pointless character , or is just here for a few extra bucks . the only good actor is scott macdonald who plays jack . he looks like a young richard kiel combined with frankenstein . sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice . plus his wisecracks are anything but funny . groaning , stupid , and bad . the plot is horrible ! throughout history there have been numerous murderers . a killer in a hockey mask , a killer with a razer glove , a chainsaw wielding moron , a rapid st. bernard , but now we stoop to a tacky killer snow man ? oh come on ! and the way the characters are introduced are terrible . for one i really wanted jack to kill the sheriffs son , i mean giving his dad oats with antifreeze in them so they wo n't freeze ? all the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to cartoony . one woman in strangled with christmas lights and has her head smashed into a decoration box and a girl is humped to death in the shower ( where is the carrot in that scene eh ? ) . and to top of this horrible movie is the special effects . the first big special effect we have is jack 's dna mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible . i mean it looks like a 60 's fashion of art design , pu ! jack looks fake as well . he looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin . all the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead stoops to low levels . jack frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made . i thought it would be a riot but no ! it does n't try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary . jack frost gets 4 out of 10 , it at least made me laugh from it 's awfulness . do n't even bother with this piece of trash . jack frost= d+
i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing . about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie . no proper character development , wait , i 'm not even sure they were characters . set-ups were hokey and inane , and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they could n't even synchronize with alternate shots . if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would . sadly , it is n't even worth the time for a few laughs . it 's just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood , and now i waste my time even thinking about it .
what a great word `` re-imagining '' is . is n't that what they call dawn of the dead mmiv ( 2004 ) ? a clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate , `` remake '' that is , and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination . well , damn , was i misled . at least i was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of `` re-imagining , '' though it played a role . still , why make a remake ? directors do it for only a few reasons really : to update a movie for a modern audience , or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it . an homage , if you will . nonetheless , it all generally ( i do admit exceptions ) boils down to one thing : stealing someone 's idea and reshaping it ( or `` re-imagining '' it ) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it . it 's like coles'/cliffs ' notes ; dump everything in a blender , purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors . in other words , a great marketing scheme . so what 's wrong with this one ? well , i 'll start with what i liked . i liked the opening scenes . thanks to cgi and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means . we see the city in ruins , thousands of zombies : chaos and death . two words that look beautiful on screen . then it all falls apart . this set-up leads nowhere . the movie does what almost every remake does . it adds more of everything except character , atmosphere , and story . it 's noisier , ( in some sense ) bloodier , and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots . the setting , the mall which played a crucial role in the original film 's story and theme , is purely coincidental . the idea communicated in romero 's film , the pure ecstatic joy of having `` a mall all to yourself as a fortress , '' is gone here . further , this `` re-imagining '' has no moxie , no spirit , no balls . it assumes ( probably quite rightly ) that the audience has no attention span and does n't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story . the film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original . you actually grew to care about those people in romero 's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall . here , you do n't care when or who goes : what matters is how they go . what else is their to say ? the film is not scary . it has one or two `` jump '' scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects . as a story it 's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it . the humor is also reduced to a few one-liners ( and one really good character : andy ) . after that , what remains ? an ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued , inevitable ambiguity of the original film . but , despite it being a pretty bad film ( though not quite as bad as some other remakes ) , it should be remembered for one thing : it kicked the passion of christ from it 's number one spot in the box office . well done zombies .
bangville police supposedly marked the debut of the keystone kops , named after the studio they worked for . in this one , however , they do n't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast-paced car that 's their trademark . anyway , mabel normand is a farm girl here who 's begged her dad for a calf . she later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police . one answers and the chase is on . next , mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in . turns out it 's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there ! so while mabel blocks her door with furniture , the mother and father try to fight their way in ! this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car . this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it 's over before it 's begun . the only real characterization that 's developed is mabel 's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except , of course , when she 's frightened . it 's easy to see why she became a star . it 's largely because of her that i 'd recommended seeing this at least once and why i 'm giving this a 4 .
though frank loesser 's songs are some of the finest that broadway has to offer , they 're bollixed by joseph l. mankiewicz ' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation -- when it 's over it barely feels like you 've watched a musical . mankiewicz does n't seem to know how to present loesser 's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect : for example , one of the best numbers , the showstopping ` adelaide 's lament ' , concludes by having adelaide ( vivian blaine ) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge ; and stubby kaye 's faux-spiritual ` sit down , you 're rockin ' the boat ' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there . mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue ( adapted from abe burrows ' stage book ) has none of the wit that his films like ` all about eve ' have . part of the blame has to go to the leads , just about all of whom are miscast : marlon brando looks bewildered as to why he 's in a musical , frank sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential ( the songs are not tailored to his style ) and jean simmons barely registers the way a shirley jones might . only blaine , as the lovelorn showgirl adelaide , commands our attention like a broadway pro should . the colorful art direction is by joseph wright and howard bristol created the flashy sets .
i loved the first season . the quality went down a little bit in the second season , which however had a great middle ( pegasus ! ) . third season was fairly novel and original and was ok. fourth season started going downhill fast , because they never even began giving us any explanations , when by now we were really starting to need them . what the hell was the cylon plan ? why were there two cylon factions ? what was the point of angel-kara leading the fleet to a devastated earth-1 ? what kind of a past did the last five cylons have , and how did they survive , or were they reincarnations ? questions everywhere , answers nowhere . and then comes the end . earth-2 ( our earth ) in the past . well , okay . but destroying the fleet ? ! giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life , and spreading a few thousand people paper-thinly across the planet ? ! that 's not only anti-science , it 's anti-reason and anti-life . and the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive a.i . that ruins everything . it is without vision , without hope for a grander future for humanity , and it is antithetical to proper science fiction . and do n't even get me started on the angels ! religious claptrap of the worst kind ! the ultimate disappointment ! ! the whole `` all this has happened before and will happen again '' thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series , not just to earth as we know it . making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius . frakkin shame . 1 out of 10 .
star rating : * * * * * saturday night * * * * friday night * * * friday morning * * sunday night * monday morning mcbain ( played by gary busey , before the name became synonymous with the character in the simpsons ) is a ( typically ) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten . avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film , the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to mexico where a top secret american super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through , only to be taken hostage , along with the crew , by a gang of terrorists . this cheap looking ( even by 80s standards ) , boring little action film was a bizarre career move for gary busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain mr joshua in lethal weapon . he just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here , edgy and zany as ever ( with 'butthorn ' being his trademark put down for the bad guys ) , but without the material to back him up . henry silva has presence as a screen villain , but he 's totally miscast here as an arab leader ( in a red beret ! ) and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden . he 's just one of a host of action film character actors , including l.q . jones and lincoln kilpatrick , who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix . after a dull first half without much exciting action , things do pick up a bit at the end , but it 's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun . *
what this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie . unfortunately with disjointed storytelling , frustrating plot-holes , and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly `` the greatest monster movie ever . '' let 's start with the good stuff : comedy , acting and special effects . from the get-go , this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky . the opening scene - the monster 's origin - is campy and quick , paying homage the the classic 'environmental ' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters . the pacing is fast , which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action . with in the course of 10 minutes you get the 'why ' , 'where , ' and 'how ' of the beast and are ready for action . in this the movie delivers . after another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced : the lazy son and his precocious little girl , kind grandfather , and talented sister ( aunt ) and , of course , the monster . the characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent , allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work . the monster it 's self looks great : alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid . the effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you 'see it 's strings . ' even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar , like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd , slipping on surfaces , crushing and eating those in it 's path . when the monster 's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment , and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie 's appeal begins to unravel . following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity . plot-lines are introduced , then abandoned , characters change their position for no apparent reason , and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent , while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random . as for the comedy , let me say this : i 'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural . i am not familiar with korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation . however , as an asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in japan for the last 5 years ( still here ) i 'd like to think i have a better grasp on asian humor than the average white-guy . that being said there were many parts of the movie that i understood were supposed to be funny , but , to me , were n't . * * * * * * * * * * * spoiler * * * * * * * * * * * * * for example : after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral ; everyone is mourning . a new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another . they both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder . this competition is , at it 's core , funny : two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy . this subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but , seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * end spoiler * * * * * * * * * * * * * * then come the plot holes . there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained , or , worse , are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end . finding out an obstacle is n't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character , but you 'd expect some comment to that nature . instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just 'are n't there ' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start . so i ask you : why even bring it up in the first place ? this was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems , and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other . of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition , but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation . not in this movie . instead it was as if you get several stories , each only explained 20 % of the way and , in the end , the parts never converge to complete the whole . again , i 'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be 'cultural . ' maybe its in korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy . maybe it 's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page , but never finishes one . maybe it 's ok to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis . or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves .
60 minutes in the beautiful christina galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she 's brought to at the beginning of the movie . is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate , a monster , black-gloved killer , or supernatural evil ? no , she 's running from a bunch of bullies . for the other 40 minutes that follow , various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught , which does n't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you 're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be alain resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like mario bava . we know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo , we get no sense of sinister mysteries/unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie la residencia wants to be but does n't quite know how to do it . we know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says `` something is seriously f-cking wrong here , man '' . when serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students , he does so with quick-cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched `` this-is-shocking '' music blares in the background . none of the aetherial beauty and longing of picnic at hanging rock to be found here . it 's all a bit clumsy and aimless , with no real sense of urgency or direction . a number of people are presented as suspects but there 's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie . i like the first kill , the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background , but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste . i have to say serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of who can kill a child ?
this movie sucked plain and simple . okay so it 's basically about a girl that gets raped , and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist . the rapist is a douche , but the girl victim is partly to blame . i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff , but when the rapist tries to have sex with her , she does n't allow it so the rapist rapes her . and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it does n't really expose or show anything , but when it comes to the rapist getting raped , it 's a pretty long rape scene . there is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching . 3.2/10
i guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized christian dogma , but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will , rational thinking , the separation of church & state and good science fiction it is a terrible joke ! there are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens . i was entertained by this movie in the same way i was entertained by `` reefer madness . '' that movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach `` christian '' principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do n't share their interpretations of our world . it had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century !
`` the dream child '' of 1989 is the fifth film in the ( generally overrated ) `` nightmare '' series , and at the latest from this point on , the series became total garbage . the only good films in the series were wes craven 's 1984 original , and the third part , `` the dream warriors '' of 1987 . the second part was disappointing and boring , and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for ( admittedly great ) visuals , and one creepy scene , a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence . the rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners , and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses , who desperately try to avoid falling asleep , because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams . lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson , and a bunch of uninteresting crap , such as a super-dumb 'eerie ' children 's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel ... in short : no originality , just a decline of the old formula , and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes . my ( generous ) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals , and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel , `` freddy 's dead '' , which is awful beyond belief . in case you 're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast , `` the dream child '' should be avoided , and even if you are , this is more than likely to disappoint .
the screaming skull ( 1 outta 5 stars ) this movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits ( an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie , a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music ) but , sadly , the movie is all downhill from there . a widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... admonishing his servants and friends that the new mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past . well , in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can . her husband assures her that it 's all merely in her mind and ... well , you can probably see where this all is going . you will have figured out what 's going on long before our hapless heroine ... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and tv shows ( and done better , too ) . to add to the movie 's myriad transgressions , most cuts of this movie ( on numerous cheap dvd compilations ) seem to be missing a few key scenes . you see the heroine slowly walking towards the window ... she goes to open it ... you know she is going to see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband 's arms . so what did she see ? ? ? i guess we 'll never know .
airport '77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman philip stevens ( james stewart ) who is flying them & a bunch of vip 's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum , also on board is stevens daughter julie ( kathleen quinlan ) & her son . the luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid-air the plane is hi-jacked by the co-pilot chambers ( robert foxworth ) & his two accomplice 's banker ( monte markham ) & wilson ( michael pataki ) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas , they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent chambers almost hits an oil rig in the ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the bermuda triangle . with air in short supply , water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor 's as they await help with time fast running out ... also known under the slightly different tile airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash-hit disaster thriller airport ( 1970 ) was directed by jerry jameson & while once again like it 's predecessors i ca n't say airport '77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . out of the three airport films i have seen so far i actually liked this one the best , just . it has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid-air hi-jacking & then the crashing ( did n't he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original airport with another popular disaster flick of the period the poseidon adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set-pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . even when the navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . george kennedy as the jinxed airline worker joe patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . the home video & theatrical version of airport '77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with george kennedy as patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of airport '77 . as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . along with the other two airport sequels this takes pride of place in the razzie award 's hall of shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that 's a little harsh . the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . the acting is n't great , two time oscar winner jack lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this , one time oscar winner james stewart looks old & frail , also one time oscar winner lee grant looks drunk while sir christopher lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too . airport '77 is the most disaster orientated of the three airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does n't help though & a film about a sunken plane just should n't be this boring or lethargic . followed by the concorde ... airport '79 ( 1979 ) .
relative to other columbo movies , this can only be rated a 1 ( awful ) . i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film . it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next . another reviewer suggested that it was falk 's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role . in fact , i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses , who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money . it 's a wonder they did n't murder him .
i was at this film 's premiere at the toronto film festival in 1997 . after the screening , when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions , no one could even be bothered to ask any . rarely has a film been so poorly directed ( why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes ? ) , wretchedly acted ( david arquette , to paraphrase dorothy parker , does not run the emotional gamut from a to b . he parks at a and brings a lunch ) and utterly pointless . characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions . at long last , the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that 's supposed to `` really make you think . '' unfortunately , what it makes you think is , `` well , there 's 90 minutes of my life i 'm never getting back . ''
if another hitler ever arises , it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film , which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start . far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land , sane people would cross the street to avoid him , and he would have died in a ditch , nameless and unknown . anyone who reads the accounts of hitler 's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly , intelligent , generous man . he was also a brilliant orator , and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made , when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches . ditto the overstated anti-semitism , which was neither a central plank of the early nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times . the film makes it look as though hitler 's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust . if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions , you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers life the one portrayed here . look instead for a charming , charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation , and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country . i 'm afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama 's than fred phelps ' . i hoped for much here , and got nothing but caricature . the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality . this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness ' .
a young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence , using human fetuses . he hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging . he 's pressured into concluding his research because he has n't published , so the university is having trouble justifying funding him ( i think ) . he does a trial injection on a monkey , which quickly dies . he then tries it on himself . he starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy ; she 's the one who had been demanding results from the research . initially , he seems to have no effects from the injection , except some new strength . he then realizes that he had some memory loss , and starts recalling what happened . additionally , he starts to appear very unhealthy . since the movie is named metamorphosis , he does eventually change into something else . you wo n't believe your eyes - either what he turned into , or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he 's turned into . incredibly , there 's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really , really absurd . about the only thing this movie has going for it is that laura gemser is in it , but she has a very small part . i 'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover . possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time , perhaps eyes that light up ( the main character 's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie ) . the copy i watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic , which had been removed . the novelty boxcover , if it still had it , would have been the only reason i would have held onto this movie ; i 'm definitely getting rid of it .
this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made . the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful . this movie misses the mark in almost every way . even the casting is baffling . take audrey landers as val . `` dance 10 looks 3 '' is val 's song . val 's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department . yes , she finds a solution , but ultimately she 's a great dancer . what do the brilliant filmmakers do ? they hire an actress who ca n't dance and is famous for looking great . way to miss the boat . then there 's the choreography . i 'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave . why did n't they use his choreography ? it really ca n't be improved upon .
i just got the uk 4-disc special edition of superman 1 for about $ 5 . the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole-men . so i slapped it into the dvd player last night , and here are my findings . some initial disappointment - i had n't checked , and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials . i 'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman , and i had n't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn - but hey ho , never mind . this black and white production runs for less than an hour . it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves ' early tv series , a two-parter , put together for cinema release , although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series . in any event , it 's an odd choice for reasons i 'll get to later . i 'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets , so there were no major surprises here . even so , for a low budget movie , this one is really low budget . the story concerns the small town of silsby - population 1,430 - which , puzzlingly , is also home to the world 's deepest oil well ( 6 miles ) . the story opens with the well 's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down . this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well , at the behest of the oil company . as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down , a couple of odd little guys ( small in stature , big in head , black in jumpsuit , and bushy in eyebrow ) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft , and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces . a deep breath now , here is the remaining plot of the picture . the little guys scare some kids , so jeff corey ( playing the town 's rampant xenophobe ) incites some pals to kill these `` creatures '' . superman steps in ( moderately ineffectually ) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital . corey 's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed , but he escapes and legs it down the shaft . corey incites a lynch mob ( despite the sheriff arresting him ) to hang the hospitalised mole-man . superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows . a total of 4 mole-men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey ( i call this an aargh ! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go `` aargh ! '' ) and superman saves him . he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved , the mole-men go back down the shaft . the end . despite the film only being an hour long , there is an inordinate amount of creeping around , bewareing and pursuing - i have left out all the `` mole-man 1 creeps from a to b , looking out to make sure no-one is following him '' stuff . the mole-men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up , get persecuted , and go back . they do look a little creepy , but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town 's reaction implies . reeves is quite a good clark kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter , much more so than phyllis coates ' rather indifferent lois lane . but he is a terrible , terrible superman . not only does he not look the part ( at least his hair is dyed black in this , which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes ) , the way he plays it is all wrong in my book . i 'm sure he was told to `` strike the pose '' ( which superman does constantly ) , but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips , not fists on ribs . and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he does n't actually wag his finger in remonstration , but he may as well have done . and superman does a huge amount of walking around ( i say a huge amount - he is n't actually in it all that much ) , and a bit of running . he takes off and lands a couple of times , but is n't seen in flight at any point . oh , some bullets bounce off him , and he uses telescopic vision as clark , but with no accompanying visual effect . in fact , visual effects are conspicuous by their absence , and the few which are present are n't very good . i 've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time : but even by those standards i think it 's a pretty threadbare effort . thankfully , production standards on the tv series were higher , and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them . something of a disappointment - i sha n't be watching it again .
watching that lady in ermine i was wondering what betty grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for marlene dietrich to do . someone over at 20th century fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another . darryl f. zanuck should have known better . betty plays a 19th century italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of hungarian hussars captained by douglas fairbanks , jr . her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree , sees no small resemblance in doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed . besides that the current betty has just been married to cesar romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment , before things have been consummated . that 's going to give anyone a bad attitude , i guarantee . fresh , wholesome all american betty is not the actress to do seductive and mysterious . marlene dietrich might have put this over , but with betty it falls flatter than yesterday 's presidential candidate . she and fairbanks have no chemistry at all , though doug is as charming as ever and someone i can watch in anything . frederick hollander and leo robin wrote the score for this film and this is the moment got an oscar nomination for best song . that lady in ermine 's one chance for oscar glory fell to buttons and bows . ernest lubitsch died midway during the film and otto preminger finished that lady in ermine . i ca n't believe lubitsch had grable in mind for the lead here . neither will you if you see that lady in ermine .
the `` wrinkle in time '' book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re-read them more times than i can count over the last 35+ years . the characters , with all their virtues and flaws , are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful , magical , spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement . if you have never read the book ( s ) i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable , the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie , and the story is interesting . however , if you love the books , avoid this movie at all costs . i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel : `` in an interview with newsweek , l'engle said of the film , ' i expected it to be bad , and it is . ' '' i , like another reviewer here , feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .
because of the 1988 writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days . it 's pretty much crap , consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from season 2 and was described by its writer , maurice hurley as `` terrible , just terrible . '' why the producers could n't just wait to shoot something decent who knows . i 'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery . this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur ( dr. katherine pulaski ) on the series .
i saw this movie , and at times , i was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me . ' munchie sullies the 'farce ' for years to come . re-watch star wars , don't-watch munchie . as a responsible parent ( i 'm speaking to those who are parents now ) , i ( you ) would not let my ( your ) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult . to insinuate munchie is satanic , to a co-viewer , is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh . ' he is fiendish , alien , rodential , and wholly malevolent - like the bogey man made flesh , invisible to adults , tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford ( without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship ) . he is a peddler of easy answers , and false ideals . he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not . he is the devil 's own ron popeil . i pray ( i mean this literally and figuratively , with an emphasis on the former ) that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd . it is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making ' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994 . munchie also loves pizza . i forgot to mention that . it comes up a lot .
i hired this movie expecting a few laughs , hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken . this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it ... aimed at an age group of 10-15 , this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied . worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives .
i am a huge fan of warrior movies . some of my favorites are braveheart , troy , the last samurai and gladiator . and after watching mongol , which is absolutely awesome , and which i strongly recommend , i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie . but it was terrible , awful , even pathetic is not a strong word in this case . the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen , but it did n't , then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end , but even that was a huge disappointment , just some random running around , waving with the swords ... there are so many good warrior movies , this one is not one of them .
first off i 'd like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film . what 's a movie without sam niel . did anyone see event horizon . d-wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly is n't . nope , no sam niel , no good movie . i recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent d-wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a sam niel film- apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend -jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red october -event horizon -not jurassic park three overall d-wars is a pile
it was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since i am a big fan the original 1944 movie . that , to me and many others , is one of the greatest film noirs ever made . realizing this is simply a shortened made-for-tv film and that most people had trashed it , i did n't expect much , but you ca n't help but compare this with the '44 film . scene after scene , i found myself comparing what i was looking at it , and remembering how it played out with fred macmurray , barbara stanwyck , edward g. robinson and others . now i was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by richard crenna , samantha eggar and lee j. cobb . when it was all over , i found it was n't as bad as i had expected but it 's no match for the 1944 original . the two main areas in which this made-for-tv film was n't as good were ( 1 ) the electricity between the two leads was missing and ( 2 ) being only 90 minutes , they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot , characters and chemistry between those leads . crenna and eggar were flat , and simply no match for macmurray and stanwyck as `` walter neff '' and `` phyllis dietrichson , '' respectively . where this re-make held its own was in the other characters , such as `` barton keyes '' and `` edward norton . '' cobb was terrific as keyes and robert webber as norton , head of the insurance company . it also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed , so the houses , cars , telephones , dictating machines , etc. , were all early '70s instead of mid '40s . otherwise , the storyline was very similar , just rushed . however , one viewing was enough and i will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film .
i 'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching , but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance . the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe , looking rather attractive , and the fact that this film is really short . the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film . none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone . i 'm not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film , but he should have definitely passed on this one . the only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything he 's done . save this one for last though . well , if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review ( or any of the other reviews on this site ) , then i hope you enjoy it more than i did . thanks for reading .
there are movies like `` plan 9 '' that are so bad they have a charm about them , there are some like `` waterworld '' that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident , and there are some like `` desperate living '' that you hate to admit you love . cowgirls have none of these redemptions . the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable , and from what i 've been told , the book is enjoyable . how then could this movie be so intolerably bad ? to begin with , it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings . then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations . open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way . finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law , because the meat packing plant just laid him off . he does have twenty years of cutting experience . this movie now defines the basement for me . it is so bad , it is n't even good for being bad .
the movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure 's spirit . the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality . the movie continues throughout to `` hollywood-ise '' the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold . the movie manages to be predictable throughout , even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences . all in all , a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king soloman 's mines and allan quatermain .
a short review but ... avoid at all costs , a thorough waste of 90mins . at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened . it 's full of cameos ( stephen fry ( 3mins ) , jack dee ( 30 secs ) , the `` philadelphia '' girls ) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just does n't make any sense . whether the story just got lost in the edit i do n't now but jeez ... put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest ! ! ! 2 out of 10 ( for the cameos and a morris minor car chase )
this is a bad , bad movie . i 'm an actual fencer : trust me when i say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that . this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop . the ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish . horrible .
first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel , revelation , matthew 24 , isaiah and other prophetic scriptures . there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message . so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations . as a christian , though an amillenialist , i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much . so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low . no , what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message , but rather its lack of production values , awful script , mediocre acting , and pitiful fx . this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s . no , this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace . this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel . the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this , but they failed . the left behind series , the apocalypse series , and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem , but their scripts are still poor , and their acting is wooden . there are great christian films , with extremely low budgets , but this film is not one of them . i 'm surprised the mst3k crew never lampooned this one .
this was one of the worst movies ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it was so bad , i was laughing through the whole movie ! the plot was so cheesy ; especially the end . this movie turns from an end-of-the-world-disaster to save-the-eels ! i mean , c'mon ! and i swear ... i think they use sock puppets for the eels ! and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced . how predictable ! it was so terrible that my mom , my sister , and i could n't finish it , and when we did finish it , it was about a year later ! the second time we watched it and we finished it this time , we did mst3k-like comments throughout the movie . summary : only watch this if you 're a movie basher ! make hilarious comments , watch this at a sleepover for laughs , and i mean huge laughs . also watch for mockery . the metaphor that explains this movie : this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets !
richard dix is a big , not very nice industrialist , who has nearly worked himself to death . if he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him , can he find happiness for the last months of his life ? well , he 'll likely be better off if he disregards the voice of the whistler . this william castle directed entry has some great moments ( the introduction and the depiction of richard dix 's life through newsreel a la citizen kane ) , and some intriguing plotting in the final reels . dix 's performance is generally pretty good . but , unfortunately , the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do . also , the movie veers from a dark ( and fascinating beginning ) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection ( full of nice urban ethnic types who do n't mind that they are n't rich ) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so . this is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role .
i guess that `` gunslinger '' was n't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that `` mystery science theater 3000 '' shows , but westerns just are n't roger corman 's forte . portraying rose hood ( beverly garland ) becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies , the movie is pretty predictable . john ireland is rose 's new hubby , secretly working for unctuous allison hayes ( yes , the 50-foot woman ) . also appearing briefly is frequent corman co-star dick miller as a mailman ( miller nowadays stars in joe dante 's movies ) . i do wish to assert that you 'll probably want to watch the `` mst3k '' version to really enjoy this movie . they had a great time with it .
`` house of evil '' aka `` dance of death '' of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez . unlike `` snake people '' ( 1971 ) , `` the incredible invasion '' ( also 1971 ) and `` the fear chamber '' ( 1972 ) which were all released after karloff 's death in 1969 , `` house of evil '' was released in 1968 , when karloff was still alive . `` house of evil '' is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies , which are without doubt all rather crappy , but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are . i personally prefer `` the fear chamber '' and `` house of evil '' over the other two , simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme , and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies , the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor . the odd story ( i do n't know if i can really call it a 'plot ' ) is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century . after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out , mathias morteval ( karloff ) , an enthusiastic organ player , invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion , which is full of eerie toys . his kinfolk includes lucy durant ( julissa ) , who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders . i wo n't give away more of the story , but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie . there are some very funny moments , especially some things karloff 's character says . boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived , and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness , and although ( or because ) his role is ( due to a poor script and and directing ) in no way scary , it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor . just like in the movie 's successors `` snake people '' and `` the fear chamber '' , the female lead is once again played by julissa . most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish , the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt . the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense . it is the poor story and dialogue , however , that makes this movie so entertaining to watch . `` house of evil '' may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie , but it is certainly as ( unintentionally ) funny as it is bad . fans of ed wood 's movies should be very amused , i personally found it hilarious . crappy but entertaining nevertheless , and definitely worth watching since there 's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor . 3/10
orca is not exactly bad , but it 's not really richard harris 's finest hour either . as a demented , ahab-like fisherman , harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale 's `` wife '' and unborn child . charlotte rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with harris . she yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone . he does n't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale . there are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale 's eye -- - there are endless shots of harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is . bo derek , as one of harris 's crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the orca and most of the supporting cast , including robert carridine , will sampson and keenan wynn do n't fare very well either .
i do n't know much about tobe hooper , or why he gets his name in the title , but maybe he should n't have bothered . as another commenter mentioned , there is n't really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre . the plot is incoherent , the sade sequences are gratuitous , and most of the acting is so-so . englund was doing his best with weak material , and zoe trilling has a really great bottom , but neither is enough to carry this film . this one 's a tape-over . grade : f
predictable parody , just about failed to impress throughout it 's looooooong eight minutes . the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits . shame something more entertaining was n't put on the dvd , like jonathan ross ' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show . '
its christmas eve and lazy and submissive housewife della ( kim basinger ) receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband . leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall . its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible , della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces , she leaves them a note saying as much . returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs , yup the owners of the car she left a note on , they are very angry and want some fun with her , a kindly security guard steps into assist her , but things get out of hand and the guard is shot , della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit , they shoot at her , she looses control of her car and crashes , quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk , she hides in a deserted building site , but is soon caught , just before they try to rape and kill her , from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench , wounding their leader `` chuckie '' , she manages to escape again into the nearby woods , in the fracas one of the gang is killed , it just happens to be the black guy here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues . a similar plot line to eden lake drew me to this , but that is where the comparisons end . this is a brainless and dumb film , shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved , the doe eyed disney-esquire twin kids are horrible to watch , but its lukas haas as chuckie , that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department , although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband . as a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through , even in the set up early on della 's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its christmas eve , now where could they be going with this i wonder ? ? ? the only surprising part of this $ hit is when after killing all the clichéd bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox , she demands chuckie to f @ ck her , if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness , it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor . even the ending is messed up , all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed .. i did n't think i could be further disappointed , but then i saw that guillermo del toro produced this dreck
i do n't know what you guys are inhaling , but please stop . this movie was complete trash . macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable , cute , sweet , loving , and extremely fun to watch . he had that innocence but at the same time , he was strong as well . this new kid , alex ? annoying as all hell ! just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin 's charm and grace , failing miserably at that . the villains , complete crap . harry and marv , they were such an entertaining on screen team . they were comedic , they were humorous , and just made you really want to root for culkin even more , which is what a good villain is suppose to do . these guys joe pesci and daniel stern , absolutely perfect for those roles . on the other hand , in 3 , we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again , try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains . not saying they were horrible , but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining . more on the corny side actually . then we got the actual movies . part 1 and 2 , classics . memorable . perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions . it makes you fall in love with the story , and care about the characters . simply , memorable and close to being masterpieces . part 3 ? masterpiece of crap . enough said . all and all , i do n't know why people like this . i think people really do n't know what a good movie is anymore . its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of . run , run away from this garbage . and lets not even start with part 4 !
for the first couple of seasons , i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show . the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job-interview was innovative , and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too `` out there '' . the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all . in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business-related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show ( that means lying , trash-talking , backstabbing etc. ) . the boardroom can be entertaining to watch , but it 's entertainment at it 's low-point - sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode . the tasks on the show are , at most , boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity . and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 ? that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life . i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season , they all seem like idiots to me . in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity , now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show . it also seems like donald trump 's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest , i ca n't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him . his rationality in the boardroom mostly does n't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it 's worth . r.i.p the apprentice . please nbc , for god 's sake , get the show off the air as soon as possible . it 's just too embarrassing to watch . the apprentice was once a great tv-show , but now it 's just a big fat joke .
del - `` you are the dumbest smart person i 've ever met . '' calvin- `` well , i had a brain , but they lost it in the re-writes . '' i think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of asimov 's work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed . in the books , she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists , able to think her way through a problem . here she 's just a damsel in distress , waiting to be rescued by wil smith . there are passing references to asimov 's laws of robotics , but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action scenes . smith is likable , as he is in most of his films , but honestly , the story is n't that good . you figure it out long before these genius characters do .
i rented this movie roughly 4-5 years ago and was instantly disappointed . i wanted to see a b-movie slasher flick , but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes . the acting was similar to watching grass dry . i 've seen better acting in a softcore film ... the idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me . how was this a horror movie ? this movie 's production value , was laughable at best . there were no scares . it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas . the plot was all over the place , if existent . if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent , skip this one . there are much better b-movies out there .
after watching this i thought to myself , there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers . at any rate , this is a terrible movie . terrible in a way that it 's not fun , but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver . makes you shout `` this is wrong '' at the movie . immersion is zero . by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors/weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc . in them . this movie is like that in every aspect . the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily , brilliantly played by eliza bennett . i hope she becomes big , and make this .. thing at least worth something . do yourself a favor . do n't watch this . there is not even proper action in it . total waste of time .
lame movie . completely uninteresting . no chemistry at all between indiana jones and the guy from black hawk down . the car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum . they manage to switch vehicles a few times , but always end up right on the tail of the baddies . the scene where hartnett grabs the family 's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be . he is telling them about eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die , which i imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty . it just came off as moronic , totally unbelievable and even cruel . some subplots were n't even explored , they were just used as filler . why does hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes ? why , and on what grounds , is the bad ia guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief ? why can ia pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist ? for some reason , even though ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor , ( he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer 's house to jack up his own commission ) , they keep coming back to him anyway ! they knew he lied to both of them ! yet there they were , coming to terms that both said they would never go for . stupid , just stupid . this is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders . there they were , just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover . amazing that they did n't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each .... the scriptwriting was terrible , the action sequences were boring , the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for ford and hartnett . it fails miserably . and ford 's phone ! turn the damn thing off ! how many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie ? 50 ? 60 ? it was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie ! every 30 seconds , that stupid tune would play ! and if it was n't ford 's , then hartnett 's was ringing ! it was incredibly annoying ! complete waste of time , ford 's worst movie since 6 days 7 nights , which was without a doubt , the lowest point of his distinguished career .
oliver hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see ollie 's new wife and baby . the problem is , they do n't exist -- ollie apparently made them up ! so , it 's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family . this is n't a particularly unique story idea , as i 've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot . the best of these was bobby vernon 's do n't kid me . it is much better than one too many -- probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later -- when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick . now i am not against physical comedy , but in some slapstick films , people starting shooting guns wildly , kick and strangle each other , etc . with little provocation . sadly , at the end of one too many , that 's exactly what they do . none of it makes sense and it was as if they 'd just run out of story ideas . overall , not exactly a milestone in entertainment . there 's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself .
written by stephen king , but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film . a mother and son move into a small indiana town with a secret . they are sleepwalkers , feline type creatures that feed on young virgins . this little story has its share of gore and special effects ; plus hints of incest . alice krige is outstanding as the mother . others appearing are madchen amick , brian krause and cindy pickett . look for very small roles for john landis and clive barker . stephen king cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery .
i do n't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions . i tolerated the first season . unfortunately , this is a show about lawyers who are n't really lawyers . god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows , which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show . it just made me gag a bit . that aside , spader and shatner , who are supposed to be the stars of the show , are the most annoying . while this might be a compliment in some situations , it 's certainly not here . their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first . but since that 's what they 're doing literally all the time , i 've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get . trying to intersperse some serious , dramatic , and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i 've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show . alan shore 's flamboyant and gratuitous `` public service announcements '' where he spouts off his opinions do not impress . denny crane is just annoying . i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane 's speech wearing a colonial outfit . i 'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show 's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care . i think the show 's writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start . the thing is , i do n't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well , but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more . i 'm not a teenager anymore , and i think this show is promising if its goal was n't to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings . of course , i 'm writing this after i realized that it 's really not gon na get much better than this . it 's a shame because it 's one of those shows i 'd love to love .
i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one 's heard of and could be a possible gem . i saw this and , since i 'm a fan of violence and gore , i got it . it got the rating of em which means : extremely mature . thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else , i got it . the warning on the box said : extreme violence , extreme langauge , and nudity . the `` extreme violence '' struck my fancy . the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick . it had one or two gory scenes but i 've seen worse in a pg-13 movie . of course the amount of gore in a movie is n't all that counts , right ? you have plot also . well , the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it . do n't rent it . i speak the truth . i ca n't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say : `` i 'm gon na rent that again . '' it had it 's moments where it kept you going but i 'm never going to see that film again .
typical troma-trash , this smutty 80 's flick is considered one of the `` highlights '' of lloyd kaufman 's notorious production studio , alongside `` the toxic avenger '' released one year earlier . `` the toxic avenger '' is far superior if you ask me , but this demented splatter-flick is nevertheless endurable as well ; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door . the events take place in tromaville , a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world , and they certainly are n't lying . the safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard , to say the least ( even homer simpson never was this nonchalant ) and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school . the first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd , who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities , but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house ! oh , the humanity ! shortly after , however , the nuclear leaks also affect the school 's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy . after smoking a joint at a party , the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum . `` class of nuke 'em high '' is bottom-of-the-barrel horror film-making , with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless . if you enjoy watching faces melting away , getting crushed or splitting in half , this is definitely a must-see ! unlike the aforementioned `` the toxic avenger '' , this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens , like for example when chrissy and warren try to figure out what 's wrong with their hormones . the crude humor is n't as effective as in `` toxic avenger '' and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish . proceed only if you 're an avid troma-fanatic .
the london underground has something inherently creepy about it , with its long winding tunnels , the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground , and of course the rats roaming the tracks.it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often . it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat , featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel , and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london . so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep . i thought the film started off well , with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving , followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london . however , creep went downhill from here , and i found myself wishing that i 'd switched it off after this opening scene , leaving me with a favourable impression of the film . all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable , even potente herself , and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness . he also made the mistake of showing the `` monster '' in full lighting , where he ceases to become remotely scary , and reveals his name to be craig . how can you have a monster called craig ? it turns into an x files-type thing , and reminds one of the episode tombs . in fact , i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me . as for the infamous sexualised violence , it is very graphic , disturbing and totally unnecessary . it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value . the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror , which is a mistake as it 's only halfway through the film . so there you go . the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell , one of my favourite occasional actors . you do n't see him very often , but when he 's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner . casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius , unfortunately the only one evident in the film .
film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar . ok . they 're talking about their imaginary lives , lying all the time , with no reason . still ok.from time to time , they even make you laugh . interesting . first 30 minutes you actually enjoy it ! but then ... things become worse ... nothing 's happening ... for a long time ... and then , when something happen , all you can see are naked old `` ladies '' touching each other ! not ok. disgusting ! by the way , this part should be the top of the movie , but it 's everything except that ! movie has no point , it 's boring , and sick ! the strangest thing is that here ( belgrade , serbia ) on fest ( film festival ) , this movie was the most popular according to researches , of course , before people watched it ! i even thought ( before watching ) : `` hay , this might be interesting , although it 's a russian movie '' ! but , god , no ! ! ! !
there are no words to explain how bad nightmare weekend is . it simply defies description . something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims ' mouth , which kills them or turns them into zombies . the whole thing is so wonky that it 's stunning . there 's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 'm not making this stuff up . the computer also controls things like cars , even though there 's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle . the `` film '' is total trash . surreal bad trash . spectacularly , one-of-a-kind bad trash . there 's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there , which are n't very hot or erotic . there 's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to french kiss a tarantula , which had me rolling on the floor . definitely one of the worst movies ever made . up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video boardinghouse , or boogeyman ii ( both nightmare weekend and boogeyman ii have scenes with a killer toothbrush ! ) . at least it 's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on .
first , i realize that a `` 1 '' rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst . this movie gets that from me because , as one reviewer points out , it 's not bad in a self-aware , over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value . it simply misses its mark on every count . * * contains possible spoilers * * the dialog is completely disingenuous . the continuity is so deliberate it 's painful . daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love , and with his final word the flamenco dancers start . the mock-shock of what 's her name ( see ? i do n't even remember her character 's name , let alone the name of the forgettable actress ) when her husband ( the baldwin ) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy . the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things . vegetable carts gone flying . cars crashing into each other . motorcycles going down the stairs . people nearly being hit , but remarkably , no one is . oh , that 's right ... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times , is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds , and an approaching car apparently did n't notice him there . hmmm . it 's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made . there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money , you 'd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing . now there 's a novel idea . my suggestion : do n't see this film . do n't rent the dvd . do n't watch it on cable . there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied .
there is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video . of course it really would n't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video . this one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential : amy adams ( am oscar nominee and talented actress ) , robin dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent , and sarah thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas . the film is also misstated : this film takes place before cruel intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that . this was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films . fortunately for the actors , hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes . so if you are looking to see something naughty , but do n't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter .
mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same year 's the public enemy . she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hood 's girl who finds that her past will always be with her . in some ways , this looks a bit antique for 1931 , almost as if you are looking at 1928 's famously inert lights of new york . but do n't be fooled . although ted tetzlaff 's photography is still in the big scenes , there 's lots of movement , indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set-ups to them . but in competition with the fast-paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at warner 's , this attempt to bring the woman 's viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker does n't work , nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort .
it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even show one asian or african person , not even as an extra . that fact probably describes norwegian race relations in general . - however . no spoilers - only a brief introductory description : buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in oslo . the protagonist are two young men that do n't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion , and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up . the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . quite the cliché . although the story is mildly funny , the acting is good and as a 'young person ' one can sort of identify with the characters ` crazy ' situations and complicated love affairs , i do n't find the story or the characters very believable . to polished and lacking in depth . this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as ` friends ' ( yes that show on tv ) . has norwegian film finally found its identity ? : audience pleasers in well known american style . how about watching lukas moodysson 's tillsammans ( together ) .
this movie was n't just bad - it was terrible . after i watched it , i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me . there is running 'gag ' with an elderly couple making out , it is not funny , but it is disgusting . the monster make up was cool , but that is all . the continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least i was . the editing is really poor . almost anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie . even if your group of friends are into 'bad movies ' this one is exceptional in its ineptitude , i could n't even bring myself to laugh at it . you have been warned .
why every horror director wants to imitate `` the exorcist '' is a complete riddle to me , as william friedkin 's `` classic '' is a very overrated film and , in my opinion , not all that tense or shocking . and yet here 's another clean rip-off , a spanish one this time , that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family . paul naschy ( who i must admit looks quite hot here ) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by john gibson because his sister leila 's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend . at first the priest does n't believe it but when john 's body is discovered with its neck twisted , leila 's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... `` exorcism '' is not only very unoriginal , it 's also an insufferably boring film ! here naschy and director juan bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore , and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that 'll nearly put you to sleep ! the last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments , albeit very stupid , and there 's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze . the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since paul naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money . this is just an awful film , end of story . other european `` the excorcist '' rip-offs are `` the antichrist '' and `` beyond the door '' and they suck as well !
this was a watchable movie , but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodney 's earlier movies . with that said , it was worth the time to watch . i gave this a 5 out of 10 . so basically , its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see , but if you find it on the tube , take a chance .
if you 've ever seen this movie , you 'd know that it ! if you have n't , and want to see a classic bad movie , i suggest you see this movie , because it ranks right down with the worst . so , if you 're really bored , go rent it . if you want to know what it 's like , here 's my little summary : adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people . adam does n't like how one passenger is getting all the babes , and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes . but wait ! it only gets worse ! you 'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is .
not even goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction . this is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say . the `` scientists '' gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers , psychologists and psychiatrists . would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro-surgery ? the field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support gores alarmist claims of global warming . as one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming . my analysis of this movie and gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant . no more , no less . ask any global warming alarmist or `` journalist '' one simple question- you say global warming is a major problem . tell me . what temperature is the earth supposed to be ?
... and it is this film . i imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife , damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity . okay , maybe it 's not that bad , but it is probably the worst film i have ever seen next to `` manos , the hands of fate '' ... and i have seen a lot of bad movies , believe you me . this is just a crummy b movie , bad film-making at it 's finest ( or is it worst ? ) the thing i really did n't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief . now , a little comedy relief is a good thing , but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons , rather than on the `` heroes '' of this film , who are actually in it for less time than them ! to be fair , crown international really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing . but honestly , this was probably a bad film to begin with , so crown really could n't have done that much to hurt it . this really needs to be in the bottom 100 list . i would n't wish this one on my worst enemy . actually , it 's my kind of campy b movie . it was bad , but i still liked it , despite my one star rating .
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was . was the viewer supposed to learn something , or reflect on anything here ? what was up with the pumpkins ? was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots ? does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel ? why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews ( it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery ) . the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished . i am truly amazed . i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .
this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen ! ! there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie . i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it . there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you ca n't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it . i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half . please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life .
well ! what can one say ? firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . the actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . swayzee is really not a quatermain character at all . after seeing sean connery 's interpretation of the great man in `` the league of extraordinary gentlemen '' , swayzee really does not make the grade . this chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . for example . when the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . i was waiting for doug mcclure to appear at any moment . in some ways i wish he had . the leader of the russians pursuing quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to london , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . he is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play . 4 out of 10 . barely
saw this film ran in the wee hours on tcm . several problems with the film were apparent from what i saw . first , the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years . several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed . the copy i saw was missing about 20 minutes or so , at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . it is too bad , because even though the script left something to be desired , bergman & russell both did fine in the film in their roles . it is a shame the large chunk is missing , but what is here is watchable . i just wish it was all intact . the script makes little sense in that bergman 's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults ? some of the time lines do n't make sense either . there is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in world war 1 . all the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film i could not see as it was missing .
as a physics student , i 've become aware of many idiot professors , and other so-called experts , in the field . as i continue with my studies , i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on , and about the people who are doing things right . then , my friends tell me of this `` physics movie '' they want to see . knowing nothing of it , i 'm excited , hoping that the information will be presented well . i 've done real quantum mechanics ; this was n't it . this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can , and will , occur to you , if you just open your eyes . let 's think about that , for just a moment . our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10^30 such subatomic particles . that is a million billion billion billion particles ! the more `` mysterious '' quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 % probability of cancelling each other out completely . as you add more and more particles into the mix , it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result . to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption , with no rationality behind it ... it 's just stupid . my friend , also in physics , and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie . but they were presented in the most misleading manner i 've ever seen . i can not say as much for the neural portion of the movie , as i have not had any kind of medical training . it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it , remembering my days in biology , but i can not say . at least this film had a redeeming quality : the dancing peptides ( or whatever they actually were ) scene . not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie , but the main character goes to a wedding , where she sees all different types of personalities `` driven '' by their peptides * , and then the film cuts to the dance floor , where we are spliced between people dancing , sometimes surrounded by cg peptides , and a fully cg scene , filled with dancing peptides . the film , at that point , was trying to tell us how we 're `` addicted to emotions , '' so we 're treated to the full song of that smash hit , `` addicted to love . '' this scene was redeeming , because anyone who could go through that scene , and still take this movie seriously ... well , you are the ones that need to `` open your eyes . ''
... bad at being intentionally bad ... this little gem shot straight onto the mst3k big screen . while it 's obvious the movie is n't trying to be taken seriously ( hopefully that their goal , anyway ... ) , the movie is still plain bad . hell , it makes leprechaun in space look big budgeted ... in short : paint my muscle car prune colored !
just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof , kate capshaw ( does she still get work ? ) as his wife ( slight age difference ) and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop ( ! ) and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer . weird casting , but the movie plays serious mindf * * with the audience . ( do n't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this film or to ever watch this film seriously due to the spoilers ) first of all , i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes : the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence . the coroner , witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him ( he is accused of the rape and murder of a young girl ) because he is black . connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty . he is approached by the convicted man 's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial . connery is stonewalled ( yawn ... ) by the small town officials and the good il ' boys club but finds that the case against blair , the alleged killer , now on death row , was all fabricated . the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him . the beating was administered by a black cop ( ! ) who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him . connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting , hannibal lecter-like ed harris , he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon . he gets a re-trial and blair is freed . i think ... film over .... then suddenly ! it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used `` white guilt '' to enlist connery . he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris . now blair is on the loose again , thanks to connery 's deluded pc principles ! the final 30 min . are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama , connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts ( yes , you read that right ) in the everglades . that was one weird film . so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient , the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers , but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry . truly depressing on every level ! the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too . two thumbs down . connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something .
i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama ( in the same vein as remember the titans ) ; however , i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture . the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie . actually , one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment . at least with the televangelist sermon , there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self-help pulp . the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long-enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie .
this thing is horrible . the ben affleck character is self-centered and gleefully sadistic -- punch-you-in-the-nose fratboy sadistic . and he 's the romantic hero ! his cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end , but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness . if i were a socialist , i would screed beyond belief , but i 'm not a socialist . we capitalists like a little christmas magic from time to time . this ai n't magic . i do n't know what it is . it 's just awful . and it 's a horrible waste of talent . o'hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s . gandolfini . applegate . these people were all underused . if ben was out of the equation , these folks might have dreamed up something excellent .
i ca n't really say what i think about this movie , its against the guidelines , i 've watched many many films , and this has got to be the worst one yet , extremely low budget , i 'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes , cause i could of did a better job with a b & w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys . it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment , cause i had to tell someone , movie rental place was n't enough . but this is my 2 cents worth , i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself . cause i sure would n't waste the money on it myself again . now i leave you with this comment . i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money .. = )
this was without a doubt the worst thing i have ever spent money on . i feel dirty for admitting that i rented this 'movie ' and actually paid money to see it . this does not even rate trash . no no . this is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer . to call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere . it was so bad i felt i had to register at imdb and warn my fellow man . this luvahire character claims this movie is great . one has to question his grasp on reality . let 's take some of his comments and analyze them . `` the actor who played ricky ( i forgot his name ) did a very good job . '' i see . well , if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers , then yes ; ricky did an outstanding job . `` i 'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it 's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off . '' wow . i too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes . luvahire , you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off . still , they can help you if you need to practice crying . just watch the movie . ha . ha . ha . `` bring on the sequel '' if i was your theater teacher at school i 'd fail you based solely on this comment alone . i am too disgusted to continue . i shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate , mr. bangla . howdy ! if you 've continued to read this far , i take it for granted that you 've already seen the movie , and you 're now looking for one of two things in this comment : 1 ) additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie . 2 ) additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself . whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee , if i say anything good it 'll only disappoint you -- so let me assure you , there is little chance of such disappointment . the other negative comments here at imdb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie ( e.g . the acting , the soundtrack , the directing , the dialogue , the editing , etc . ) , however all of these faults can readily be forgiven , in and of themselves . few people will rent a movie titled `` hood of the living dead '' if they require these elements to be top-notch . the ultimate failure of `` hood '' , however , is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name . `` hood of the living dead '' practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one-liners and gruesomely creative kills . here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto , to have gangsta-thug zombies bombin ' on the innocent living while rockin ' do-rags , to have undead pimps drivin ' over all-too-mortal po-lice in their tricked-out rides . the mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious . instead , the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing , but do n't understand . to avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video-rental audience , i suggest that the quiroz brothers re-release the movie with the following new title : `` hood of the living dead : a home-made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored '' . or perhaps they could release it as a documentary . `` the day creativity died : an exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio . '' the potential renter whose interest has not been quelled , should find the following blurb on the back of the video case : `` the quiroz brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting. '' -- mr . bangla
not exactly my genre , this straight-to-dvd street fight action is one i only encountered due to a friend putting it on whilst we had a few beers . i 'm relatively open minded , and quite a fan of eamonn walker , so i sat back ready to enjoy myself . blood and bone is the story of isiah bone , an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for unclear reasons which eventually unfold as the film progresses . blah blah blah . what a tedious film . i understand that films like this do n't rely hugely on plot , but do they have to stuff in such a silly , predictable and entirely stupid storyline ? it may not be important , but by golly gum does it annoy me . better no plot and pure action than a clíche-ridden fleabag mongrel of a narrative . infused with entirely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel , it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten innards . i should probably at this point mention what is , of course , the film 's drawing point : the fighting . even in itself , the fighting is rather poor . bone manages to take out well established tough-man street fighters in single punches ( a large oaf or two is the filmmakers ' laughworthy attempt to rectify this inconsistency ) ; fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy . even this is repetitive and stupid , arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we get to see time and time again . a run of the mill , film-by-numbers movie which fully deserves its straight to dvd status , doing absolutely nothing new and everything we 've seen time and time again . and not even particularly well .
the worst movie i have seen in a while . yeah its fun to fantasize , but if that is what you are looking for , i suggest you see brewsters millions . this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny . unless you are five or like terrible movies , do n't see this one .
there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version . the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got . the us version of this show is everything that reality tv should n't be . instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt . i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive . the rather vulgar product placement that takes place , particularly by sears , is also uncalled for . rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires , it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home , build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to . giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses .
1 ) i am not weapon expert , but even i can see difference between u.s. army riffles in wwi and wwii . in movie we can see privates , armed with `` m1 garand '' ( invented in year 1932 ! ) , not authentic `` 1903 springfield '' ( aka `` silent death '' ) , who privates use until wwii . difference - m1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate ! m1 was semi - automatic , springfield requires reloading after every shot . little difference ? ! 2 ) german army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 year too . especially - helmets . german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top , we can not see even one in movie . and if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this `` true story '' ? i am surprised , how much `` truthful '' can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation .
it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations . mac ( akshay kumar ) and sam 's ( john abraham ) characters are not properly built before mac 's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess . rest of the drama is about how mac , sam and uncle mambo ( paresh rawal ) deal with situations which at times seem forced . about the cast , paresh rawal is a very talented actor , i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook . akshay kumar is tolerable , john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie . the second half of the movie is funny at times , but in all a dud ( songs are boring ) and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy .
some fraud girl tries to compete in the big leagues of motorcross by swiching places with her brother . she gets to the top by lying and manipulation . she should have been disqualified . the movie promotes lying and cheating to win . also the idea of a 9 yr old mechanic is absurd . it takes many many years to get good . go back to the tonka toys .
at what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? when does a movie go from `` watchable '' to `` where 's that & ^ @ _+ # ! * off switch '' ? thank goodness for dvds , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! likewise , thank goodness for the `` fast forward '' switch on the dvd player . i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office . at one point ( i 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a blur ) , our `` hero , '' luke wilson starts running through traffic ; i think he was looking for a cab . it was at that point when i gave up , realizing i could n't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck . the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the `` heroine , '' uma thurman . that scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing luke and uma . that was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? ten minutes into the flick ? every time the movie tried to become `` funny , '' it could n't . every time the movie approached `` excitement , '' it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent . the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . when uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend , i felt like i was watching `` the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction '' ; that 's when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked `` the 40 year old virgin '' and `` pulp fiction . '' luke wilson 's sidekick , rainn wilson ( also seen in the dreary `` the last mimzy '' ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . rainn wilson , the king of television boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . hey , rainn wilson ! leave full-length motion pictures alone ! every time uma 's rival , anna faris , came on screen , i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see anna faris in `` scary movie , '' that 's all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium . the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick .
why review good movies when you can review `` trancers ii ? '' ooh , this film is soooo lame . i can just picture the cast and crew driving around l.a. with a camcorder , hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor , long-suffering tim thomerson . the stars ' families actually turn up to play cameos , probably because full moon could n't afford `` real '' extras . lame effects , lame sets , and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic trancers ! and yet ... and yet ... it rules . note this is the same thing i say about `` trancers iv . '' i say it because it 's true . what can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies , then bust out with quips like , `` do n't worry ladies , they 're bio-degradable '' ? well , lots of things could be better , but anyway this is still good stuff . my only significant reservation is megan ward , who really stinks up the joint . she 's a lousy rival for helen hunt 's character - they 're both young pieces of eye candy , and it would 've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more . oh well , you ca n't have everything . at least the wonderful plot device of the `` long second watch '' is back in place , and we 've got more of hap ashby , the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema ( oh , wait a minute - he 's got a rival in the form of david ogden steirs in `` creator '' ) . i have n't seen this lately , but i do seem to remember that martine beswick runs away twice during the final battle . hooray for lousy continuity ! just one of the many highlights in this fine film .
this film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie . but for me , it failed . i wo n't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line , but if you are looking for a detailed explanation , the comment by user `` reluctantpopstar '' gives a good description of it . but it did n't work for me . i found it slow , which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere . the viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films , one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason . i do n't think that this is the case here . as for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users ... i see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the `` action '' . and i suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one .
disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer , who was easily one of the last century 's most recognizable degenerates/serial killers . released straight-to-video back in early 2003 , `` dahmer '' is an overtly talky , boring , badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do ! what it does , however , attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely , nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin ' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold , calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was ! overall , 2003 's `` dahmer '' is one that true-crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because i 'm not kidding when i say that it 's one of the worst serial-killer biopics ever done ! it 's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like `` gacy '' , `` bundy '' , `` ed gein '' and `` the night stalker '' ! ( turkey-zero stars )
end of the world is an uneventful movie , which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth . the main character is some kind of scientist , i 'm not exactly sure what kind . he has two jobs at a government ( ? ) facility guarded by four security men . his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space ( although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job # 2 ) . job # 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least that 's the best i can figure . apparently the `` plant '' is not exactly top-secret , as the scientist brings his wife there . she hangs out ( they 're on their way to a dinner ) while he discovers a message from space : major earth disruption , repeated over and over . he says something about it being the first message from space he 's ever been able to decipher ; his wife tells him they 're going to be late for the dinner party . so they leave and go to the party ( ! ? ! ) . moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake . from there , the movie goes ... nowhere ! yes , christopher lee is in it , but that really does n't help much . besides , lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii . this movie is boring , but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z-grade sci-fi . plus , there 's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .
well , you know the rest ! this has to be the worst movie i 've seen in a long long time . i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role . the lead role is played by ( to me ) a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey . bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70 's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques . this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts , however , even this ca n't disguise the fact that the lady does n't know how to throw a punch . an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing . sorry , the only mystery on show here is how this did n't win the golden raspberry for its year .
what is left of planet earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors . they must eat bugs and insects , or whatever , after a poison war , or something , has nearly wiped out all human civilization . in these dark times , one of the few people on earth still able to live in comfort , we will call him the all knowing big boss , has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air . it seems that the all knowing big boss is the last person on earth that knows that these spores even exist . the spores are located far away from any living soul , and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems . the all knowing big boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers . so , he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location . sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret . sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air . how about letting sleeping dogs lie ? ! the one pleasant feature of encrypt is the radiant and elegant vivian wu . as the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing , engaging vivian wu 's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much . she is an object of love , an object of desire -- a very believable concept ! fans of vivian wu may want to check out an outstanding b-movie she is in from a couple years back called dinner rush . dinner rush is highly recommended . encrypt is not .
do n't get me wrong - i love david suchet as poirot . i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : death on the nile . everyone has done this one ! we know who dies . we know why they die . we know who the killer is . we know how it was done . so i say enough already ! mr. suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie 's novels . i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . the sets were terrific and very realistic . i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how 'awful ' he looked . i hope he does n't look that way in 'real ' life ! i honestly ca n't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . somehow i do n't think so . i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms. christie wrote it that way . i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison !
i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's tom ( bighouseaz @ yahoo.com ) . the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement . i have seen zatoichi 1-13,15,16 ; i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 ( usa ) . zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing . the story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines . at one point , i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film . this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character . all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects . i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend . this is the first zatoichi film from his studio . i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films -- and recommend them .
even steve martin and dan aykroyd could n't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg . based on the classic phil silvers tv series , it bombed because : a ) it was updated to the 1990s , and b ) the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing , feeble and silly screenplay . the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks . to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble , and it shows . no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time .
lois weber , self proclaimed missionary via the cinema , wrote , directed and produced other films on controversial subjects , but this may be the first to get wide viewing , thanks to tcm . this film is her indictment of abortion , but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control , leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion . her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here , but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically . if you have wondered what tyrone power , jr. 's `` famous father '' looked like , here is your chance . 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece . it 's enjoyable even if you do n't appreciate the propaganda .
well , the writing was very sloppy , the directing was sloppier , and the editing made it worse ( at least i hope it was the editing ) . the acting was n't bad , but it was n't that good either . pretty much none of the characters were likable . at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential . it was a great idea , but yet another wasted good idea goes by . it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what was n't predictable was done so badly that it did n't matter . the ending was not worth watching at all . sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies . the movie looked rushed also . the movie just was n't really worth seeing , and had i paid for it i would have been very mad . maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one . the movie over all was not horrifibly bad , but i would n't reccomend it . i gave it 2 out of 10 b/c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character ( justin i believe , the super smart one ) . and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes . it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape , it was not pretty . anyway , if you see it , wait for the $ 1.50 theater or video , unless you like pretty much every movie you see , then i guess you 'll like this one .
this is really a new low in entertainment . even though there are a lot worse movies out . in the gangster / drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline ( this movies does not , i mean sebastians motives for example could n't be more far fetched and worn out cliché . ) then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable ( this movie does not . ) sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again ? what 's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age ? interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family . but this movie does not go in this direction . even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes . was n't he already down and out , why does he do it again ? so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama ( but then again , this movie is just not , because of focusing on `` cool '' production techniques and special effects an not giving the characters a moment to reflect and most of all forcing the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breath and naturally evolve . ) it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence ( would be political incorrect these days , would n't it ? ) but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie ( like there are so so many out there ) with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin what 's left of his reputation by doing what he always does . so all in all i .. just ... ca n't recommend it . 1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing .
maybe you should n't compare , but wild style and style wars are original hip hop . beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop , but they 've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break , of course for some it was and that 's nice . but if you view this as original hip hop culture you 're wrong . it 's overproduced and has a hollywood sauce . rather look for the first two movies i mentioned . they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto . yes , the rating for this movie is low , but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving . this is probably because although the story , the acting , the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful , the music and dancing is what the people love about it . me , i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop ( i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic hip hop artists appeared , like krs one , public enemy , ultramagnetic mc 's , jungle brothers , bizmarkie to name a few ) , and i still do n't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it does n't work for me . i mean , wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic . of course tastes differ and that 's alright . but as far as i 'm concerned , this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i ca n't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten .
you 've got ta hand it to steven seagal : whatever his other faults may be , he does have good taste in women . if you pick a seagal movie , chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it . and usually , they do not function as mere eye candy ; they get involved in the action and fight , shoot guns , kill with knives , etc . `` flight of fury '' offers the duo of ciera payton ( who has a very sexy face , with luscious lips to match angelina jolie 's ) and katie jones , and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling ! and if it seems like i 'm spending a little too much time talking about them , it 's because the rest of the movie , although passable , is so unexciting that it 's hard to find much else to talk about . ironically , the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself , who looks as if he ca n't even be bothered to try to pretend to care . this being a military-type actioner , there is very little fighting in it , and he does n't fit into his role ( a stealth fighter pilot , `` the best in the world '' , of course ) very well , which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking . ( * 1/2 )
this may very well be the worst movie i 'll see if i live to be 100 . i think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this . i 'm dumber for having watched it , and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film . and after i finally turned it off , i actually had the urge to vomit . no one had a clue about photography when made this . no one had a clue about acting . no one had a clue about just about anything . i ca n't believe f/x shows this crap on occasion . the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz ! channels - not even the main one . and it was on at about 3 a.m. at that .
the exploding zeppelins crashing down upon 'sky captain ' jude law 's base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is . first off , let me state right off the bat that i sincerely doubt that paramount will ever recover any money from this film . a cult hit it might become , but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve . i can see the studio pitch now . `` let 's combine 1920 's german expressionism and a 1940 's globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene ! wow , wo n't that be a success ! `` skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess . there are too many fake explosions , too many unconvincing dogfight scenes , and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two-dimensional . after all , why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three , or five , or one hundred ? ! moreover , what could have been a groundbreaking film , seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting , will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using cgi . quite simply , the graphics are amazingly poor . from the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights , everything seems to be just a little off . i 'm not being nit-picky here in any way . an infant could notice that a car does n't glide along the road like a maglev train ( unless its a mercedes s500 ) . and for those of you raising your voices in protest , crying out 'this is a stylized film , it 's not supposed to be like reality ' , let me just say this . lord of the rings has set the standard for integrating real-life actors with cgi , starship troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films , the rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920 's back into the hollywood film portfolio , and tim burton 's batman created a unique picture of new york city/gotham that has yet to be repeated . sky captain falls so short of all these films , it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence . plus , the acting is so poor , it makes me positively ill . so there you have it . i spent $ 9 to see this film and you get my review . i hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that i did .
corridors of time . the movie you can watch if you 're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide . some use guns , ropes , or gas , but you want to ruin your brains ? do not wait any longer ! corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes : thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun . i do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me : sometimes , one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero . this film deserves a 2/10 , but that 's only because i like jean reno . too bad for him , he also stars in ronin . i think i 'm gon na dislike him ...
i have seen bad movies before , but this one takes the `` worst movie of a lifetime '' award by far ! ! anthony hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one - anywhere ! i will never see another movie with him in it , directing it , etc. , etc . ! i ca n't believe the other actors & actresses that i liked , ( in this picture ) , that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster ! there must be some great drugs out there ! for anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film , is beyond me ! save your money on this one ! huge flop from beginning to end ! shame on you mr. hopkins ! also , shame on christian slater ! i ca n't believe you put your reputations on the line for this one !
this movie was terrible ! i rented it not knowing what to expect.i watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb.the acting was bad and there was no plot.the monster is soooooo fake.it growls and its mouth doesnt move.also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster.just plain bad do n't even waste your time . ( 1 out of 10 )
i 'm a don johnson fan , but this is undoubtedly the worst movie , done by anybody , that i 've ever seen . the acting was bad , as was the cinematography . don should stick to doing action , because as the king , he just did n't cut it .
i saw this film on its release , and have watched it 3 or 4 more times , including last week . i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr. branagh 's performance . this is really a glorious , sumptuous film , to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed . derek jacobi , julie christie , kate winslet , richard briers , and many others do fine jobs . then there 's kenneth branagh . if ever there was a vanity project for an actor , this is it , and mr. branagh spares nothing in putting the `` ham '' in hamlet . from the stunt casting ( which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon ) , to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of `` naturalness , '' to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others . his performance confirms that , while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary , he has never been a great film actor . the scenery budget could be charged to catering , mr. branagh eats so much of it . his performance is a perfect example of why people do n't go to see shakespeare - `` full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . '' and if there is fault to his direction , it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance . no matter what theories people may posit on the bard , he was , after all is said and done , a playwright . the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless . although there is no `` right '' way to play his plays , there is most certainly great acting , good acting and bad acting . shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of `` hamlet '' itself . it amazes me how mr. branagh `` mouthed '' it , but did not hear it . it was an example of spending too much time working out how he 's going to say something , and too little figuring out what he 's saying . while mr. branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions , he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it . his direction has always been better than his acting . i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare . he set a great template for other productions . and , it would be interesting to see him onstage , from about 20 rows back . but , i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less . is it worth seeing ? certainly . there are many little joys to be found in the film . but , it 's a long , long movie and , by the end , one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it .
i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it 's original release . it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly . the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow , and the ending was ridiculous . it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen . i wo n't say that i 'm a huge peter sellers fan , but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there . but this film should never have been made . from what i 've read , he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him . fine , but that still does n't excuse the studio actually releasing the film .
i came at this film with high expectations . i was aware of greenaway 's work and 'the tempest ' and was interested in an adaptation . i first wanted to switch off after ten minutes , but felt that it would be unfair . there was a representation of a storm , but where in your mind do you conceive a small boy peeing over a toy boat ? it is symbolic of what ? i continued another ten minutes my finger twitching over the 'off ' button , somewhere something would capture my interest . this is not shakespeare , it is not cinema . there is a time and place for it , but i will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of shakespeare . after twenty five minutes i gave up and that was the end . i then read all the comments on this website and the pretentiousness of the film is only matched by its defendants . 'its a painting ..... then put it in a gallery ' , 'it 's a ballet ..... keep it on the stage then ' . shakespeare can be done intelligently , and the plays were performed to mass audiences , they were accessible , and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large - and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that .
this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation . on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on . the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved . she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened . the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer . then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell . the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just ca n't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that . the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind . this movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller `` blood song '' with frankie avalon staring in it , the same motive just a different character part . it 's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80 's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back !
anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions . 1 . the angry eyes look he gives every enemy . 2 . the holding of the hands to face , mouth agape and frightened eyes . 3 . the smiling tommy turnbull . i have to say that i pretty much hate this show , i do n't watch it but it 's like code lyoko , we 've all watched at least one , i must say that this show is borderline racist , uninteresting and pointless . every episode ends with robotboy winning , except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack . the jokes are pretty crude too , i think it 's mostly people saying the word `` suck '' or farting , i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too . is n't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate , and the other uses a chain , for god sake , what kind of school is he going to . not to mention his older brother , who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities . the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters . like you could say the trio of coop , jamie and kiva , as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he 's free spirited despite being a robot . there is simply no appeal to this show , i 'm surprised that it 's still running .
the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german ( post ) war movies . it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet . however , the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés . it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie , which is a direct copy of the cover of 'pearl harbor ' . luise kielberg ( bettina zimmermann ) gets to hear that her husband , who is a doctor , ( ulrich noethen ) has died in russia and after the war she 's struggling to survive . she finds a job at the american base , gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer ( heino ferch ) in town , falls in love with 'm , gets pregnant , and all of a sudden her husband turns up again . come on ! ! ! we 've seen this once too often . heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well ; bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince . for some reason it always seems she 's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes . it just did n't work for me . the action scenes with the planes and the air lift , we 're sometimes exciting , more often not . nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot . unless you 're a big fan of wwii movies , i suggest you spend your money on something else : chocolate ice-cream brings a lot more satisfaction ! 4 out 10 !
i 've seen most of ryuhei kitamura 's work and i 've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action . scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts , gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage . with `` versus '' and `` aragami '' kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget . so what happened in `` alive '' ? to be more blunt , the answer would be - nothing . nothing happened in `` alive '' it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot . adapted from a comic book by tsutomu takahashi `` alive '' is an examination of the life of one tenshu yashiro ( played by hideo sasaki ) a death row convict who survives his execution . he is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments . he chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it 's host 's humanity grants supernatural powers . naturaly at some point that parasite moves into yashiro , the bad thing is that does n't happen very soon . similar to `` aragami '' , `` alive '' sets it 's first half in establishing the basic exposition . characters are introduced , their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered . the whole thing even takes place in just one set . the first major problem of that comparison is that while `` aragami '' was just a 70 minute movie , `` alive '' drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long . that length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case . dialogue is dry , monotonous , delivered without any sense of emotion or depth , characters themselves are n't much interesting . there were some small attempts at making `` alive '' a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic : evil government people against , super-powered protagonist , whom yes you guessed it , saves the girl in the end . like i previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set , and after two hours that does get boring , even worse the set design itself was n't even interesting to begin with , and does n't do much to improve on other aspects of the film . now , after that first part is over , one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning . sadly that is not the case . the two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from hollywood movies , complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers . they 're just not interesting or fun , kitamura 's creativity from `` versus '' is gone , the small set even limits his often very impressive camera-work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights , a shame really . evidently `` aragami '' was better on all accounts and `` kitamura '' had learned something from `` alive '' . so it was n't at least a total loss watching this movie . if only to understand the errors made , how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie .
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with `` book of shadows '' , i was wrong . this film makes that look like `` the magnficiant ambersons '' compared to this piece of shameless , unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie . i 'd write more but i 'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it , bobbins . and were these people english ? and where is the forest > i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands . the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation . those angels looked like anorexic pornstars ( turned most of them were , did my research ) . i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in pieces . p.s i love and admire tom savini but he can not act
no matter how you look at this movie , it is just awful . if you view it as a horror , then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets . if you look at it as a comedy , then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame . if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b * * ch ! if you look at it as an action you ca n't really pull for the whiny hero . as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining . as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a gremlins type movie . this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre . critters looked pretty good , so did the ghoulies , heck even the puppets from the munchies looked better than these . the characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable . the hero is a whiney security guard , his girlfriend is always complaining , they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend , and another friend who is a spaz . at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes ... this movie is just utterly stupid . i like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum ( which is obviously not a club , but more likely a diner ) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 . give me a break , i am 25 and i look younger than any of them .
holy @ # % & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with . i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen . i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv , and thats saying something . i once witnessed a cow crap in a field . i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half , who knows ... it might have moved or something . well that was time better spent than watching this tripe . the acting was non-existent , the plot was somewhere other than on this film . i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er . please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs . it 's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i 'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal . bah ... i ca n't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone . let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack , walk to your car , start the engine , then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you ca n't feel your bones vibrate anymore . be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway . you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself . by the way , i watched this after a `` buddy '' of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it . he dint come over , she had too . whats worse is that she had to watch this $ % & @ thing twice ! i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month . i hope it was because of this film .
near the closing stages of baby mama , one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it 'was all just a mess ' ; i really could n't say it any better than that . and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again , the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone 's time . a lacklustre cast , mundane script and vague , caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly is n't taxing on the ol ' noggin , but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour . consisting mainly of very routine , cliché jokes based around an odd couple ( rich and poor ) trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world , the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic . as a story on finding love , it 's not that bad , but playing this plot line as a side-story of sorts to work alongside the comedy-orientated odd couple tangent , characterisation is notably weak , resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles . as characters themselves , both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces , but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness ; so while we may eventually come to find the character 's interactions with each other amusing at times , the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles ; we do n't feel for the characters and do n't find them inherently interesting , but rather their dynamic . unfortunately however , although this dynamic works best , or at least better than the individual personas , as mentioned above , it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd-couple formula . kate ( tina fey ) is a successful business woman who has hired working class , dumb-blonde angie ( amy poehler ) to be her unlikely surrogate , and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl ( dax shepard ) , both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences . yes , it 's the typical odd-couple premise , and one that we have already seen in this year 's what happens in vegas , yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi-layered characters . kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air . in fact , the movie 's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of romany malco who gets lumbered with playing a door-man . of the few times that i laughed during baby mama , most of those moments were because of this man , and the remainder usually fell to shepard . it 's a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script 's themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera , and yet director michael mccullers goes from page to screen effectively enough . yet , for a film about babies , multi-million dollar business and cultural stereotyping , this is n't necessarily a good thing . baby mama is grade-a , hammy , plastic tinsel-town with capital bore topped with sugar . so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two-dimensional nature , but i simply did n't care for the world they inhabited . the dialogue , along with sets , costumes , and the script 's general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director 's incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy ; these are n't characters and that is n't our world in any way so why should i care ? at the end of the day however , a romantic comedy 's ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests , and the frequency of its laughs ; baby mama has little going on in any of these departments . of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair . i 'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings , but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored . in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable , but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience ; a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch , baby mama is too light-headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining . - a review by jamie robert ward ( http : //www.invocus.net )
an actor asks , `` what 's my motivation ? , '' to understand his or her character . after viewing this this `` docudrama , '' this vague and haphazard farce , a viewer wonders what anyone 's motivation was . this inept offspring of daytime t.v . ( the oprah show ) missed by a mile a great opportunity to explore weighty issues . its characters were all shallow and superficial , its story line far less socially redeeming than a `` simpsons '' episode . it gratuitously portrayed investigating police as unprofessional and incompetent . it failed to offer why the court might treat the main character , a female child molester , so differently than it would have a male perp . why did this unrepentant woman begin `` grooming '' her second grade student , beginning an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade class ? why did the boy 's mother testify in her behalf ? the simple answer is overwhelming narcissism , plus generational rationalization and greed . the movie gave no hint of that . why was n't the viewer informed that the victim 's mother sold interview rights to print and television tabloids , parading her adolescent son on `` the today show '' ? that mary kay 's lawyer cashed in , she herself appealing a `` son of sam '' statute so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder ? why was n't it explained that letourneau 's father was a former right wing republican congressman , the 1972 american independent presidential candidate , the john birch society president ? in 1983 john schmitz 's political career ended when he was found to have had children by his own community college student , exposed only when that mistress sexually mutilated their infant son ? yet letourneau 's dad had removed his many kids from `` too liberal '' catholic schools , fighting to keep all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education ? a month after her conditional release , again pregnant with the now 14-year-old 's second daughter , mary kay received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous probation violations . a prophetic editorial regarding the sad affair then appeared in the seattle times : `` at the end of two wretched hours , letourneau was led off to jail , and this salacious melange of made-for-tv seaminess was over , until casting begins . '' sure enough , 18 months later , filming of this travesty was underway .
dear god ! i kept waiting for this movie to `` get started '' ... then i waited for it to redeem itself ... and when it did neither , i just sat there , dumbfounded that : 1 ) it could possibly be this bad , and 2 ) that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity . i had faith that drew could n't possibly have made this bad of a movie ... and boy , did i ever lose my faith ! do n't bother with this one ! drew tried , but the movie was poorly written , poorly acted , and just poorly conceived ! i ca n't believe a script this bad ever got funded ! it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea , ( the word `` concept '' is too big for this movie to even qualify for ! ) and it still did n't go anyplace ! its just pitiful ! where the other reviewer got the idea that it was n't the worst , baffles me ! because believe me , if it got any worse i 'd have slit my wrists before finishing it !
dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards . the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands . first , a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing . second , the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed . the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains . it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted . as the movie goes on , the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect . however , the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings . unfortunately , the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once . just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast ! and the low budget can not be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here . i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor . the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site . the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue , without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them . the direction is uninspired . the inspiration from j-horror movies such as ringu , the grudge and one missed call is evident . unfortunately , the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j-horror . j-horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown . tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation ( a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example ) , and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning . there is no humour or tongue-in-cheek element in these movies . everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you ca n't help but be convinced and captivated by it . the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact , very much unlike the `` jump scares '' used in hollywood movies . the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi . the homage to j-horror could have been well intended . unfortunately , the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed `` scares '' on the screen . the make-up effects of the `` ghosts '' were n't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic . i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie . i could n't give away the ending even if i wanted to . i simply could n't understand it . all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax . what remains ? the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom . the movie is a chore to sit through . thankfully , the pain ends after an hour and a half . however , most would probably switch off long before the end . there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the `` f-word '' in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find . this is what the 2 stars are for . those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house , the changeling or the j-horror sub-genre . if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget `` r-rated '' horror movie about ghosts , watch death of a ghost hunter . it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store . i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague .
rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie `` our gang '' release schedule , `` a tough winter '' features two storylines . first , wheezer and mary ann , home alone on a wintry day , decide to make some taffy . little wheezer relays the directions to mary ann from a radio cooking show . the problem : wheezer relays information from different shows and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix ! funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house ! the second storyline deals with stepin fetchit , a neighbor/handyman of the gang , and his interactions with the gang . `` a tough winter , '' to my knowledge , has never been shown on television , although it is available on home video . the reason for this is the stepin fetchit characterization which shows a shifty , sly , and slow-moving character . `` our gang '' producer hal roach called fetchit a `` skilled comic '' and used this `` our gang '' entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day . understandably , fetchit 's characterization is offensive to many people today , which explains why the film has been shelved . although there are some funny moments both with fetchit and the taffy , `` a tough winter '' is a plodding and meandering effort . if one positive came out of this film , it was that the hal roach studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies . the sound in the film is good , and some of the sound effects used are very funny . for this reason , this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 `` our gang '' films . 3 out of 10 .
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmuller 's film is incomprehensible . this new film is a mess . there was one other person in the audience when i saw it , and she left about an hour into it . ( i hope she demanded a refund . ) the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i 've never walked out of a movie . but i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film . the dialogue is laughable , the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery . ritchie took lina 's movie and turned it into another `` blue lagoon . '' this is a film that you would n't even waste time watching late night on cinemax . time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this .
a 1957 ( yes , that 's the correct date ) j. arthur rank production with james robertson justice , margaret rutherford , wilfred hyde white ; it has to be a smash comedy , right ? oh , it 's just awful . it 's a one gag film : watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator . music is thrown in , most inappropriately and forgettably . jeannie carson is a lively dancer and competent singer . but what was she doing in this film ? diana dors is here too , providing oh-so-daring shots for use in the previews . her acting level is not bad , but she 's in the film to provide someone to leer at . well , one must do something beside groan during this film . the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on e-bay . spare yourself the expense and the waste of time . a comedy without a laugh . a musical without a memorable song or dance .
what is this ? a low budget sex comedy ? anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain . they could come up with a better idea , i mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s .. and people like them ! this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one ( you ca n't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing , he 'll never want to go to spain ) . this should be rated `` r '' , because only people 35+ seem to laugh watching : s i 'm truly disappointed , maybe i do n't like gays ( which is quite an important part of the movie ) . foreign humor is awful in films ( except kusturica ) , stick with doing dramas ! if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
ugh . this is a terrible film , full of disastrous comic relief , no scares , and scary leaps in story and plotline . the only creepy thing here is the leading lady 's hats . lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows . i give this a 1 , and this ai n't no fun .
there is a lot to like here . the actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit , likable family . however , for that reason the film does not ring true . we see leo , who apparently just learned of his hiv positive diagnosis , essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself . as well , the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what leo , his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him . the young actor who plays leo 's brother , marcel , is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast . unfortunately , the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of hiv on a functional , appealing family or what the devastation hiv is on the victim - so it only hints at both . while this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers .
the film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about 5 mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see , i do n't like this film and would n't recommend it to anyone , the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home . this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually ran out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish . i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that . if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy , better still do n't go and see it at all .
i had a video of the thing . and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep . it 's slow-moving , and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform , which may have been revolutionary at the time , is now just a great big yawnaroony . apart from conrad veidt , the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable , and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting . when the water started to spill big-time it even , on one occasion , woke me up . but give the man his due . no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt . he does n't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals . he holds it in his fingers , while showing us the old pearly-browns . there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background , and looks very artistically done . but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke .
i generally do n't give worry much about violence in films , or a vast amount of philosophy , symbolism or psychology . all this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us . there is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature , a good setting of characters , a good direction . this film could be voted for as a good film . however , it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting . first of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film . not movie violence , i am talking about real violence . this violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two ; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women . not that we all do n't have some real twists with women . ( respectively men ) . but the conclusion of the film ruins it all . * spoiler * our `` heroine '' finally dies , ( by here own hand if i remember correctly i saw this film years ago and it enraged me , now the guy is out with a new film witch i am certainly not going to watch ) and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon , nature growing over her , in particular her sex .. of course it is the director who `` kills '' the women heroine . women have to die , especially if men are attracted by their sexuality . that seems to be the final conclusion . * * end spoiler * well , well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself . but to use big pictures , artsy directions cruelty to living creatures , just to say men can be frightened of women , and men are cruel to women . thats just not enough . i knew when i saw this film it would achieve good critics for the `` philosophical , eastern and artistic '' and whatever approach . but to me this film is just totally marred .
there are two kinds of 1950s musicals . first you have the glossy mgm productions with big names and great music . and then you have the minor league with a less famous cast , less famous music and second rate directors . 'the girl ca n't help it ' belongs to the latter category . neither tom ewell or edmond o'brien became famous and jayne mansfield was famous for her ... well , never mind . seems like every decade has its share of bo dereks or pamela andersons . the plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one ca n't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for fats domino , little richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie . if that music appeals to you this is worth watching . if not , do n't bother .
documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass . watching this silent , black and white feature , marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition , is even duller than it sounds . the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen , and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line . i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins , but despised this movie , notwithstanding the similarity of the theme . physical hardships alone are just not that interesting .
what in god 's name happened here ? how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies ? was zombie '90 ever supposed to entertain someone ... anyone , or even make a dollars profit ? but mainly , what happened here ? zombie '90 extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas , who specializes in earth-shattering gore films , such as goblet of gore , and anthropophagus 2000 , and some of which contain profanity in the titles . in the gore department , this one is n't much different than the rest . although , the level of ineptness ... well , earth-shattering . zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson 's dead-alive is gory , think about it . getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time . an accident , involving chemicals causes the dead to come back , and eat the living . never has the concept been treated in such a manner . the gore effects are a whole , new low . just a z-grade nightmare . i ca n't tell whether , or not this was originally meant to be funny , somehow , i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script , but stranger things have happened . the whole thing just reminds me of a shot-on-video introduction to a troma movie , except it lasts a hell of a lot longer . i 've seen only one film that was worse than this , the chooper . for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director , i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie , give extreme pestilence a try , but you 've been warned . it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through . but if gore is all you 're here for , then you might be able to stomach this one . other than that , no atmosphere , no , and i mean no budget , no entertainment value , but mostly , no pride . show some pride , schnaas . 1/10 updated 7/5/09 : after a few more viewings of zombie '90 , i 've had a change of heart , or i guess i just get it now . zombie '90 is hilarious , so nevermind the harsh words , although , extreme pestilence still only deserves one star .
granted , this seems like a good idea . steve martin , goldie hawn , and john cleese in a neil simon comedy . where can you go wrong ? watch the movie , and you 'll find out . in truth , martin , the lead , is mis-cast . he 's not doing the great slapstick he 's known for , from movies like `` the jerk '' , but instead plays a sort of in-between character that does n't work . hawn , with no one to play off of , is terrible . cleese is the only even partially funny member . to top it off , the plot is pretty stupid . i ca n't say how much of it may have been changed , but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense . they blunder through new york , not doing anything right , and unfortuneatly , nothing funny . not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable , it seems to give the message that people who do n't live in new york are n't very bright , a theme repeated throughout the movie . in summation , instead of seeing this , go rent the original `` odd couple '' again .
some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to stuttgart and finds that germans are `` racist . '' this is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-wwii anti-german propaganda films , aimed to make germans feel `` bad '' for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase german blonds and sell drugs to german teenagers . if you 're looking for good german films in general , see `` der tunnel , '' `` der untergang , '' `` europa europa , '' and `` lola rennt . '' but not this . also , `` das experiment , '' with the same male actor from `` lola rennt . ''
my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video . although it had great actors/actresses , there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest . plus it just was n't that interesting . dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable . i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn 's last movies . i 'll always love john ritter best in slapstick . he was just too pathetic here .
i realise that the us army was demoralised by 1971 , but this film was unbelievable . it was supposed to be a training camp not the ss punishment battalion in a sven hassell novel . the writer must be a real army hater . the psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell , and the useless black top sergeant should have been sacked as well . these men were going overseas , the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from , and an investigation would have ensued . the scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one . farrell , the alleged barrack room lawyer , would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture pows in contravention to the geneva convention ) , actual assault on an enlisted man , sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer . intead he just walks away . after this , discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable . i do n't know how it ended , i went to bed .
warning : this review contains spoilers . do not read if you do n't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film . with a cast like this , you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into . did they see the script and say , ` hey , close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one ca n't fail . ' unfortunately , it does . did they even think to check on the director 's credentials ? i mean , would you do a movie with the director of a movie called ` satan 's cheerleaders ? ' greydon clark , who would later go on to direct the infamous ` final justice , ' made this . it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer ` final justice ' and completely miss out on ` the return . ' the film is set in a small town in new mexico . a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them . in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film , the ship spews some kind of red ink on them . it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it , so right away you are treated with cheese . anyhow , the ship leaves and the adults do n't believe the children . elsewhere , we see vincent schiavelli , whom i find to be a terrific actor ( watch his scenes in ` ghost ' for proof , as they are outstanding ) , who is playing a prospector , or as i called him , the miner 1949er . he steps out of the cave he is in , and he and his dog are inked by the ship . twenty-five years go by , and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd , who works with her father , raymond burr , in studying unusual weather phenomena . or something like that . shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town , and she travels there to research it . once she gets there , the local ranchers harass her , and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on , and deputy jan-michael vincent comes to her rescue . from this point on , the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other , especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier . while this boring mess is happening , vincent schiavelli , with his killer dog at his side , is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item . you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at halloween , the kind that you shake to make them glow ? schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people . it 's the second-worst effect in the movie . every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick , the scene 's atmosphere suddenly turns dark , like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement . it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is . and what does all this lead up to ? it 's hard to tell when the final , confusing scene arrives . see , burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of ` calling card , ' but none of it makes sense . why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not ? schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead , but even that does n't make much sense when you really think about it . i mean , why does n't he kill jan-michael vincent ? after all , he had twenty-five years to do it . and the aliens wo n't need him if shepherd is dead anyhow , so why try to kill her ? speaking of the aliens , it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent . what is their goal ? why do they wait so long to intervene ? how could they be so sure shepherd would come back ? not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made ` the return ' any more pleasant . you would still have bad lines , really bad acting , particularly by shepherd , cheesy effects , and poor direction . luckily , the stars escaped from this movie . cybill shepherd soon went on to star in ` moonlighting ' with bruce willis . jan-michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b-movies , often in over-the-top parts . raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death . vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films . martin landau , who played a kooky law enforcement officer , quickly made the terrific ` alone in the dark ' and the awful ` the being ' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently . you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to ` the return . ' zantara 's score : 2 out of 10 .
i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting , instead of watching this `` movie '' ... anything will do , even stare at the walls is better . and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text , i tell you also is a low budget movie , bad acting , no name actors , a stupid mutt as the wolf , and so on ... also the story brings nothing new , the special effects are made in the 80 's style . the movie is almost as bad as the movie `` megalodon '' . so have fun ! ; ) ( not watching this movie )
n.b . : spoilers within . assigning an artistic director to an operatic production naturally and inevitably means you are going to get a piece of that director 's mind . but directing a wagner opera is an especially tricky task , as he was perhaps the most explicit opera composer in terms of what things should look like and how they should unfold . hans-jurgen syberberg loads this filming of `` parsifal , '' wagner 's final masterpiece , with enough extraneous ideas to cause it to nearly burst at the seams . you get more than a piece of the director : you get the whole fatted hog and then some . syberberg is to be admired for his penchant for tearing back the covers on the uglier aspects of german history . but does it work to meld that desire to a wagner opera already brimming with its own concepts ? the scenes with the knights of the holy grail in acts i and iii are especially laden with visual allegory and symbolism . these are drawn come from wagner 's own time , from long before , and go well beyond . if you know what these things mean , they can enrich syberberg 's vision for you ( but not necessarily enhance wagner 's vision ) ; if you do n't know what they mean , they 're simply confusing , if not annoying . i wo n't bother uncoiling the plot of the opera here . suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements , in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles , practices , and pageantry of christianity . the theme of redemption plays the main role here , as in nearly every wagner opera . i personally had to sweat to get through syberberg 's first act ( amidst my jarring acclimation , the music saved the day ) . but act ii picks up the pace . here we meet klingsor , the evil sorcerer , out to entrap the wandering `` innocent fool '' parsifal . the greatest seductress of them all , kundry , will be used to entice him to the dark side . after an initial dalliance with more symbols , these get stripped away , and the long , gorgeous , transformational duet between young fool and temptress really takes off . finally the film starts working a genuine magic , and it is chiefly due to syberberg 's choosing to set things naturally and simply . suddenly the acting starts to work ( the expressive actress edith clever and the luscious soprano of yvonne minton team to create a wondrous kundry ) ; suddenly the music seems to come to life and make vivid the inner turmoil of the two characters . the camera work stays simple and quietly fluid . in other words , wagner is allowed to tell his story more on his own terms . and it works beautifully . for me it was the most engrossing part of the film . with the re-entrance of the knights in part 2 of act iii , the weird extraneous symbolisms unfortunately creep back in . some other loony syberberg ideas : using a huge wagner death-mask as a major set-piece ( causing the composer 's protuberant proboscis to loom comically large ) ; dressing the act iii knights in all manner of costumes , wigs , and makeup ( what is the director saying ? that the knights are a bunch of buffoons ? that they express multiple or timeless layers of significance beyond their surface functions ? it 's anybody 's guess ) ; the insertion  just after the incredibly touching baptism of kundry by parsifal  of rear-projection footage of the conductor rehearsing , in modern-day realism , his orchestra in the studio ( this completely snapped my dramatic thread , requiring a few minutes to regroup ) ; the complete avoidance of having any time pass between acts ii and iii ( when we meet the knight and `` narrator '' gurnemanz again , he should be an old , old man , and parsifal should re-emerge as a world-weary but wiser middle-aged man ) ; but certainly the most bizarre stroke is to split the parsifal character into male/female components . some find this the most brilliant stroke . no doubt i can credit karin krick , who plays `` parsifal 2 , '' with acting of strength and dignity ( she also happens to be the best lip-syncher of the whole cast ) . but please ... wagner 's conception of parsifal is already so complex . his growth from a completely innocent boy who knows nothing of his past , to his breakthrough realization in act ii of what amfortas 's eternal wound means and how it has become his own , to his return as the great redeemer of act iii  this is the journey of a masterfully constructed character . the bi-sexual emphasis is just gimmicky and absurd . ( and what 's with this nonsense about a homoerotic gurnemanz and parsifal ? ? ca n't we just accept a mentor/apprentice relationship , which is marvelously reversed in act iii ? ) the monte carlo philharmonic under armin jordan plays with passion and beauty ( though the chorus is disappointing ) . but after watching this film i only wanted to whip out my solti-led recording ( highly recommended ) and get my wagnerian bearings straight again . the film experience for me ranged from bizarre to entertaining to infuriating . to syberberg 's credit , he 's created a visually arresting work , and he certainly offers a unique take on an important opera . but instead of sticking to `` parsifal , '' he seems to have wanted to bring in all things wagnerian : the man , the life , the enormous influence ... all of it in crude symbolic code . `` parsifal '' the opera is already full of weighty symbolism : the grail , the spear , the holy sacraments , baptism , amfortas 's ever-bleeding wound , klingsor 's self-castration , the kiss , kundry 's curse , and on and on . this is not to mention the * musical * symbolism sounding constantly in the score , in the form of wagner 's leitmotif system . `` parsifal '' itself is one huge symbol ! getting back to my first-paragraph question , syberberg 's whole hog is all way too much for me . but if this project sounds like something to tickle your fancy , then go for it . i wo n't recommend just staying away from this ; you may find yourself heartily satisfied . or if you need something to crack your wagner barrier , try it ... but please , please , do n't stop here . `` parsifal '' is in a late , very ripe league of its own .
* * spoilers * * this is one bad movie . seriously . acting in absolutely horrible , the fx are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful . but hey , its so bad that its fun watching ! the script is so bad that its enjoyable ! you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as `` i guess thats what you call crocteasing . '' as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile . i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad ! it has such horrible jokes that they 're funny ! but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap . i really started to fall asleep . trust me though , the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time . though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do . heh heh mindless movie , which has to be nominated for the mst3k line ! !
awful ! absolutely awful ! no plot , no point , no end . it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch . every day . i 'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it . i 'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like benigni . roger , i 'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one .
cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity . unacquainted with the work of the director , i am well-acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - ozu yasujiro . while not even approaching ozu in greatness , hou has communicated nothing of ozu 's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space . one of the things he misses entirely is ozu 's attention to character - we are not even `` introduced '' by hou to his lead character ( a perfect blank page ) . there are no medium or close shots of his people . one of the dvd extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what hou does n't - a good look at their faces . there was a great spanish film by bardem called nunca pasa nada , which translates to something like `` nothing ever happens '' . that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise . all through the film we are given clues about an obscure taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack . but the clues , like everything else , add up to nothing . unless you 're a trainspotter , this film has nothing to recommend it .
there is no suspense in this serial ! when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy , the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day . no , in fact , the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode ! this show is so boring that i ca n't see how it ever got made , let alone released on dvd ! obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films , but even the script is awful . an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that , i am not quite sure , because it is too awful to follow . watch the 60s version , or the 90 's versions , or even batman begins , just anything over this version !
this is possibly the most boring movie in history . i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director roman polanski . i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again . it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage . my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well . i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie , it is slow , dull and has no real plot . you wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started . i understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around . thank god disco and three 's company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers . oh well just my thoughts .
this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning , but never fleshed out to it 's expectations . the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas ( typical of the asian directors ) , but does n't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film , never finding a solid , explainable , interesting angle . basically , the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . the acting was very good , however . all the actors gave good performances , and jude law was outstanding as he is always is . it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .
i went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful . and it was . i really felt sorry for the star-studded cast- kathy bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this movie- vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson could n't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for . fred 's dad , played by trevor peacock ( of vicar of dibley fame , amongst others ) , had about one line . the plot was predictable and all over the place , and the humour was ... lacking . ( however , there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family ... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic ) do n't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train ( actually- maybe the train would be better ... )
franco rossi 's 1985 six-hour italian mini-series of quo vadis is a very curious beast , creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion ( very few long shots , no big cityscapes ) , but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background . the shifting structure ( much of episode one is played out via voice over letters ) and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six-hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding , and certainly far too often uninvolving , but it has something going for it . the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius ( a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest , whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue ) as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he 's become incapable of experiencing emotion , and klaus maria brandauer 's unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience ' will receive it . elsewhere , max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes , being rewarded with the show 's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome . it 's the kind of thing the show could do with more of , but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional , inspiring or exciting moment under it 's relentlessly low-key direction . unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero , blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet , slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties - you know , the one who you think is called dave or something like that . the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends . not a trip i can particularly recommend , i 'm afraid , but if you do embark on it it 's one not entirely without its small rewards .
whoa boy . ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him ? well they exist , in many forms . but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who did n't ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone 's praises about how much of an artistic `` genius '' he is ? well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene ( i know they 're everywhere and i do n't even follow the local scene ) , or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe . the premise is good and , honestly , it 's not as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that 's one of the difficulties of doing a documentary . we are made to follow two bands , the brian jamestown massacre , lead by anton , and the dandy warhols , lead by courtney . i 've heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie ... not so the brian jamestown massacre . why ? well from this documentary 's perspective , because the brian jamestown massacre 's intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry . however , instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed , the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity . because , see , anton is a `` genius . '' because he plays rock music . he really `` understands the evolution of music '' ... because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments . his music is considered `` post-modern retro but the future '' ... because it 's rock music . he wants to bring out a `` revolution '' ... through rock music . okay so let 's face it ... twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i 'd care to watch a documentary about . the documentary itself does n't really lend itself to showcasing any of anton 's talent , because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we do n't really have the time to focus on that . so instead we watch anton , `` the genius '' , the socio-maniacal loser , be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music . whether he did or not i wo n't know , because its not like the documentary had enough time to prove it . what i do know is that then we 're left with a story about some self-centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up . why even bother watching that ? people like anton do n't deserve the attention they seek , the hope and admiration of all those different people , and especially a post-failure paean to lost potential . this movie plays like a two-hour rough-cut vh1 special for a reason : he goes on and on about the music , but it 's all about the image and the attention . look at the guy , look at how he dresses , look at how he acts , look at how he tries to create controversy because he ca n't afford marketing . honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel , and that 's because of anyone in this documentary , joel is the only person who seems to have any fun . maybe it 's because he 's the tambourine man . the rest of them are all `` rock stars '' ! they deserve our attention , and admiration , and interest , and engagements ! they are out there to `` save rock and roll . '' do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to `` save rock and roll '' ? yeah , that was because of anton , and it 's `` selfish of them not to mention me ( anton ) as an inspiration . '' what a load . people like anton are best left forgotten . this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull -- because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless . thanks a lot , anton . your antics ruined music for everyone you touched , whatever the opinion to the contrary is . and if people `` in the know '' about anton disagree and he really was a genius , it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way . -- polarisdib
i decided to watch this one because it 's been nominated for oscar this year . i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie , but ended up bored and disappointed . first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in `` shaky hands '' camera mode is really annoying . i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this : american `` military machine '' ( people , who makes money on war ) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something ( sort of ) patriotic . why these `` heroic '' efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of `` loving-war-like-a-drug '' ? .. oh , please , come on ! what a bore ! watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall ...
one of boris karloff 's real clinkers . essentially the dying karloff ( looking about 120 years older than he was ) is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies . moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories . desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying . she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo ( who i think is married ) . if you think i got that from watching the movie you 're wrong , i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened . why ? because this movie had me lost from two minutes in.i had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines . little is spelled out and much is n't said until towards the end by which time i really did n't care . its a dull mess of interest purely for karloff 's performance which is rather odd at times . to be honest this is the only time i 've ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory . its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out .
mario van peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo . glenn plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way . stacey dash and lisa raye have been in better projects . bobby brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen . this is how it was pitched ... five tough women shootin ' and lovin ' in the wild wild west . four black and one asian . oh and lil ' kim is a tough talking ' heartbreaker and marie matiko can bring in the pacific rim market . we can shoot it for less than 15 million . straight to video and we 'll double but more likely triple our dollars . greenlight that puppy . you got it boss .
the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery . this movie was long and boring . the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed . how many times can his boys take the lord 's name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background ? it does n't fit . i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly , smirkish , selfish story of paul ( brad pitt ) . so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn't-so what . it 's very uninteresting . we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl . that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real 'wild western ' . what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister 's sons have nothing to do but 1 . norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies . i 'd rather watch a show about fishing that that film again-which will be never .
the youthful group in `` st. elmo 's fire '' who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university . for the most part , these kids are irresponsible , selfish , greedy and stupid , yet co-writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation . with a now-outdated cast of `` up and comers '' , a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of `` terms of endearment '' , and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us , `` fire '' is a paltry blaze , one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on . * 1/2 from * * * *
after being a big fan of the ten minute t.v episodes of 'stella street ' , i awaited this film with excitement and anticipation . unfortunately i was left feeling very disappointed . i was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the t.v episodes , and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing , as if the actors had said them once , and could n't be bothered to say them again . i bought my copy on dvd and felt cheated that i had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again . * spoilers * the plot of the film starts with stella street ( a normal english street in surrey ) , gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years ' , including michael caine , al pacino , jack nicholson and the rolling stones . all the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster , and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people . there are some nice moments , but on the whole , the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring . * end of spoilers * in the t.v episodes , all the characters are performed by john sessions and phil cornwell ( including females ) , but in the film ronni ancona is added to the cast . i think this was a mistake . her impersonations were n't funny , and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do . if you were not a fan of the episodes of stella street , you may find this film entertaining . but if you were a fan , i think you may walk away feeling a little bit cheated . 4/10
well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast .. i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who ? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who ? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who ? race against time ? u mean waste against time ? ok so first you spoil your kid , then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway !
a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes , edited together and with added voice-over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first . pretty cool idea , but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof . as it 's just not as funny as `` anchorman '' , and really let 's face it that film was n't exactly comedy gold either , so you get a 'movie ' worse than one that was moderately funny . in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above `` kicking and screaming '' , or `` bewitched '' . chross your fingers that `` the wedding crashers '' is a return to old school form ( no pun intended ) my grade : d
first of all , this is a low-budget movie , so my expectations were incredibly low going into it . i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest , and essentially that 's all it is . plot ? there really is none . it 's basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse . cast ? there is none , period . special effects ? absolutely awful in my opinion ... there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts , splatter , color , texture , etc . i believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal , shock film . now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting , poor dialogue , awful acting , what seemed like camcorder video shots , and just plain unbelievable `` gore , '' made this movie truly awful . there are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews , even `` b-rate '' movies deserve some opportunities ( blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it ) , but this was simply awful . i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against it . i 'm all for brutality and shock , but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience . save your time/money and chance something else , you wo n't be disappointed .
human pot roast joe don baker ( mitchell ) stars in this dull , unremarkable ` action ' movie as deputy geronimo , a fat , gassy slob who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit , listening to country music and eating too many donuts . meanwhile , a vaguely criminal guy named palermo ( played by the guy who owned the drill in fulci 's gates of hell ) stumbles into joe don 's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene . joe don- slowly- gives chase and offs palermo 's brother after uttering his now legendary catch phrase ` it 's your move . think you can take me ? well , go ahead on ' . for some reason joe don , a texas lawman , must transport palermo to italy ( ` mr. palermo 's been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government , ' says mr. wilson , another vague character played by bill mckinney , who was in master ninja 1 , she freak , and a lot of good clint eastwood movies ) . anyhoo , joe don 's plane must land on the island of malta , where palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like jon lovitz . and that 's where the movie grinds to a halt . for the rest of the movie , joe don looks for palermo , looses palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more . then joe don keeps looking for palermo , looses palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more . then joe don looks for palermo , looses palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the malta chief of police , and then is let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more . this is one aggravating movie . at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea . all the other characters wonder if he 's dead or not , finally concluding that he is . but then he shows up ( he was rescued by a poor family ) and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days . even his cute , julia louise-dreyfuss-esque sidekick does n't welcome him back . she does , however , offer to help him find palermo , so joe don looks for palermo , looses palermo , ends up in a jail cell , is yelled at by the malta chief of police , and then let go with a warning not to look for palermo any more . highpoints include , a bizarre carnival with strange colorful floats , some sexy strippers , a shoot out involving a kid dressed like napoleon and a cart of tomatoes , a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk , and any scene without joe don . lowpoints include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat hanger . it should be noted that this is from greydon clark , director of angel 's revenge , who appears as the sheriff . ick !
spoiler warning . when the main character 's sister is pushed down the stairs , the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her , to make it appear that she 's been drinking . but right before she is killed , tells her sister 's business partner ( teri garr ) on the phone that she has n't had a drink in 4 days . yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report ! and , the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs . huh ? really bad mistake in this movie , which is pretty awful , overall . surprisingly bad , considering the great cast . some faults : the writing is n't very good , the music is made-for-tv bad , and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie .
this film was on late at night when i saw it . it was interesting at start but it did n't convince me as a whole . i am no tyson fan . in fact i do n't like boxing at all . it 's barbaric , obscene and double faced ( by society ) that some get money for beating each other up . nevertheless , i felt the start of the film was ok . actors alright , especially george c. scott ( as cus d'amato ) . i do n't know how reliable the flick is . i have n't read books and books about boxing or tyson . i do n't know anything about the man , but it was quite entertaining . as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it 's charm and i also lost interest . i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough .
well how was i suppose to know this was `` the '' dumb ass promotional `` lordi motion picture '' ? i mean , i realized this when that `` dinosaur '' costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance i was humming `` hard rock hallelujah '' to myself ... even though i hate that song . `` dark floors '' is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they , and the rest of the people in that particular elevator , become momentarily trapped ... when they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around . the hospital is empty ... except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason ... they run through the hallways and stairwells , encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish , shock-rock costumes ... nothing really memorable here , except the lousy acting , lack of gore/nudity , and the utterly shameless promotional edge , reminding me very much of `` kiss meet the phantom of the park '' . yeah , remember that dud ? wish i did n't ... i would just recommend avoiding all of these ghost house films like a fungus and not listen to lordi since they are a gwar ripoff band !
i watched this knowing almost nothing about it , other than the brief description i read here . after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish , then i looked at the other stuff he 's done to see if this was his first or second movie , but no , he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com . he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one . the story was pretty awful too , could someone just fall in love with a girl because she 's pretty but has the mind of a child ? i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible .
( aka : the bloodsucker leads the dance ) lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in . the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me . gothic lesbians get invited to a count 's island castle for the weekend . one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around . it 's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit . go figure ... ( sic ) dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity . directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo , this is one snoozer . pretty boring 2 out of 10
i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood 's novel 'the robber bride ' , and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version . a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder , and his buddy , an ex-cop journalist , tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman 's crazy female friends . it 's fortunate that the movie script fixes ms. atwood 's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men , victims of scheming women ... heh . okay , you got me . if these guys are mentioned in the book , and i 'm pretty sure they 're entirely made up for the movie , i 'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy . apparently , the three main female characters of the novel are n't enough to carry the movie . zenia 's manipulations are n't interesting unless we see them happen to a man , and a man 's life is screwed up . roz , charis , and toni tell their stories -- to a man . because it 's not important if a man does n't hear them . i liked the characters in the book . it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man 's story . i normally do not look for feminist angles on media , and i tried to enjoy the movie as is . if i had n't read the book , i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more . so if you like the cop and the ex-cop , and you want to read more about them , you 're out of luck . read the novel , if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot . it 's the same plot : the movie excavated it , ironed it , and sprinkled it with male angst . it 's like zenia 's revenge on margaret atwood .
the movie is about two stories : one is a political murder of a call-girl , the other an upper-class political party . the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino , as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening . if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama , the performance of al is memorable : how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man ( as `` the godfather '' ) as here as a little servant ( see also `` donnie brasco '' ) . actually , the big young lion has become a tired old one . this passing of ages is very moving , because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too . but his slowness is only a make-up because he can get back his energy in church scene . maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al 's talent !
i never finished this movie for a reason , it was dreadful and thats just the acting . i was n't even sure what the film was about tbh it did n't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful . i mean ususally i like some nude in a film ( lol ) but it was just sick because of what was happening . all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities . this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please . i would n't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it . ( n )
i went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son . he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did . the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / disney excursion . in fact , i had a very hard time paying attention at all . the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk out . not to say that the film is n't an interesting concept , it 's just told so oddly , ( bad screenplay ? ) especially when we `` meet the family '' for the first time . i know we 're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord , they could 've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes ( seemingly , i did n't actually time it ) . by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit .
disappointing and irritating . the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion . character is not explored in depth . these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element , the mother 's affair with her daughter 's lover . anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines , such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye . the script portrays darren ( daniel craig ) as a dr. jekyll/mr . hyde without any hints about why , except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene . a mature writer could have done so much more with this topic .
based on the personal experiences of director john singleton 's time at the university of southern california , comes higher learning . a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges . there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story : malik williams , an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male . kristin conner , a sheltered soft white girl , and remy , a unsophisticated unconnected white male . all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared ( malik ) , by being naive ( kristin ) , and by being unwanted ( remy ) . one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large . the colleges are not places to build character , develop potential , or enhance personal advancement , but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere . it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students . it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics . but it did n't and that 's where the films falls apart . singleton , it seems , had a pretty bad experience at southern california . through this film he lets it all hang out . there is no need to beat around the bush here . singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen . the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains , save for kristin , who was raped by a fellow white student . who can understand the inconsistencies of this film ? black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her ? the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence ? the performances of omar epps ( malik ) and kristy swanson ( kristin ) are disappointing . they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie ( tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable ) . o'shea jackson aka ice cube , busta rhymes , and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles . and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor . only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character , of the three main characters , changed the most in the film . john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film . and he did so quite badly . it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun . life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this . higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all . seeing the film , then and now , would only confuse , disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to . not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest .
this video nasty was initially banned in britain , and allowed in last november without cuts . it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 , ursula buchfellner . the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures . i am not sure what the purpose of that was . it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene . laura ( buchfellner ) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom . peter ( al cliver - the beyond , zombie ) is sent to find her and the ransom . of course , one of the kidnappers ( antonio de cabo ) manages to pass the time productively , while another ( werner pochath ) whines incessantly . the ransom exchange goes to hell , and laura runs into the jungle . will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal ? oh , yes , there are cannibals in this jungle . why do you think it was a video nasty ! muriel montossé is found by peter and his partner ( antonio mayans - angel of death ) on the kidnapper 's boat . montossé is very comfortably undressed . peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura , who has been captured by now . they pass the time having sex , and do n't see the danger approaching . guts , anyone ? great fight between peter and the naked devil ( burt altman ) . blood , decapitation , guts , lots of full frontal , some great writhing by the cannibal priestess ( aline mess ) , and the line , `` they tore her heart out , '' which is hilarious if you see the film .
i knew i was going to see a low budget movie , but i expected much more from an alex cox film . the acting by the two leading men was terrible , especially the white guy . the girl should have won an oscar compared to those two . this movie was filled with what i guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud , which is rare . without these laugh-out-loud moments i would have given this film 2/10 . what happened to the alex cox who made all the 80s classics ? spoiler : there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over . why did the mexican guy go to the other guy 's house at the beginning ? what did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job ? why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him ? i guess i should have gone to the q & a after the movie , but i did n't want to get up at 10am .
after we counted the use of the f word , oh , about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film , listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse , and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together , well , we turned it off . relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie , the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers . we did give it a second chance , thinking surely it would get better . no dice . later , my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved , still no dice . the main character did have a cool bike . i would n't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents , or frat boys .
very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci , who tries , but can not save the poor structure , dialogue , direction , or talent of our leading man . pretty much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has , is its quirky side characters . but without a realistic backdrop , such characters are pointless . nothing to see here , keep moving ...
in my lit . class we 've just finished the book , hatchet , and this movie is nothing like the book . ( 1 ) brian never ate worms in the book . ( 2 ) he did n't know the pilot 's name . ( 3 ) his mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see . ( 4 ) the man the mother is cheating with does n't have black hair , he has blonde . now for the unrealistic parts of the movie : ( 1 ) a thirteen year old ca n't punch his fist through a window in one punch . and for the acting , the kid who played brian was a horrible actor . however , i do believe that the scenery was impressive , though i highly doubt the director even read the book . this movie is good if you have not read the book hatchet , by gary paulsen , but if you have , then begin a complaint letter to the director .
! ! ! ! possible mild spoiler ! ! ! ! ! as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn ` t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge / joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s . it starts with a murder and it ` s left for the audience to muse `` is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney ? `` , but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a `` lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client `` type film which ends in a ridiculous manner , and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect . this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men
i wanted to like this film , yes its a saw , blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films . if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good , not brilliant , but good film .... unfortunately those ingredients had gone off ! the acting was terrible , and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one ( hoods taken off ) , the remarks and one liners are just terrible , yes i know , bad writing .... but this is more than that , it was bad writing coupled with bad acting . two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film ..... sorry , im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all . i will end with plot holes , plot holes & more plot holes ! disappointing !
`` true '' story of a late monster that appears when an american industrial plant begins polluting the waters . amusing , though not really good , monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out whats going on but not in a completely involving way . give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy . an amusing exploitation film thats enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind . ( my one complaint is that the print used on the elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago . )
i could only get through about 25 mins of it . not one laugh in the 25 minutes i gave it , one of the most painful films i 've ever had to endure . chris kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him . just a horrible movie .
it 's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do , and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark . film students should take this as a lesson and a warning . would be graduate has an idea . he wants total control . so he writes , directs , produces , his cinematic masterpiece all by himself . usually , his concept is far beyond his budget . usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with . usually , he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes . usually , he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it 's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget . usually , he ends up with a series of encounters ( we can not do justice by calling them scenes ) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old . and usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer . when you look at judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it 's just the usual fare .
i am not from america and i know what 'wife swap ' is . when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program . but what i got was a real sucking stupidity . i was misjudged by its title name , it has no adult contents , no nudity , not even vulgar dialogues ( broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited/mute out such contents to make it neat ) . a show which gives a picture of current american/western family state , overweight chubby peoples , polluted teenagers , and their sucking family goings . in each episode two wives/two mothers ( more correctly ) were chosen to live in each others home and re-changes each others family routine with their new own rule . sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad . on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days . it 's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights . i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff . i mean who make this program , more than that who gave the name `` wife swap '' ; its better to be called as `` mother swap '' . all in all it corrupts all the great things the real wife swap stands for ! wife swap = average sucking reality show .
ludicrous . angelic 9-year-old annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old annakin , who somehow seems appealing to amidala , 5 years his senior . now 22-year-old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams , and so takes to slaughtering children , his friends , and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a ) his precious wife might really die , and b ) only he can prevent this . ludicrosity squared . i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention . the story is ridiculous . the characters are unbelievable ( literally , not the perverted sense of `` fantastic '' , `` wonderful '' , etc. ) . obi-wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series , but in the climax , he hacks off annakin 's legs , lets him burn in the lava , and leaves him to suffer . does n't anyone think that 's a little out of character ? not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living , as it turns out . i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations . none of that here . the story could have been written by a 10 year old . oh yeah , the cgi is pretty cool .
the premise for circle of two is an intriguing one . a forbidden love between a sixty year old painter ashleigh ( richard burton ) and a fifteen year old girl sarah norton ( tatum o'neill ) ; and the question of whether such a relationship is acceptable given society 's standards . the problem with circle of two , however , is that it fails to live up to its promise . director jules dassin and hedley should have put more thought into the screenplay . when i watched this film , i expected to learn something new about love and sexuality . instead , i got boring dialogue , a pointless lecture on art , outings where sarah seemed to have more fun away from ashleigh , and a closing scene so artificial that its emotional impact was lost . this script makes good actors look bad . so one can imagine how the film 's problems were compounded even further with the largely amateurish cast that jules dassin assembled . tatum o'neill was not in her element . i did not believe for a second that her character sarah was in love with ashleigh . her performance seemed superficial , like a contestant at a beauty pageant . it was as though she forced herself to be happy , when the script required her to be happy , and to be sad , when the script asked her to be sad . the only scene i liked with her in was at the very end when she said nothing at all . that was probably the closest tatum 's sarah norton ever came to being real . but tatum was not the only one at fault . richard burton 's ashleigh lacked the charm , the charisma and the complexity to attract even women of his own age , let alone a fifteen year old . the rest of the cast was also dismal . even their arguing was unconvincing , because they waited to take turns . who does that ? michael wincott as the jealous ex-boyfriend paul was probably the best thing in this film , but his role was small . to be fair to the actors , dassin 's direction let everyone down ; but it is also true that a great movie goes beyond the script . kubrick 's lolita did that with james mason and sue lyon ; konchalovsky 's runaway train went beyond the script with jon voight and eric roberts playing convicts . the directors of these films also knew how to use music to dramatize their films and reveal something about the characters in them . in spite of its own score ( a combination of antonio vivaldi , carl off and bernard hoffer ) , circle of two never succeeds in doing that . in conclusion , the idea of a forbidden love story between an elder painter and a teenage girl is a good one , but its execution in circle of two is terrible . in many ways , it is a shame that a controversial , lolita-type story  which most film directors for understandable reasons would prefer to avoid  did not have receive more intelligent treatment ; that a script which actors would have gladly rehearsed was not written ; that actors , who were committed to their part or had the talent to make their characters real , could not be found ; and that the director jules dassin ( who did so much better with films like rififi and topkapi ) did not have to will to put his foot down and say , `` before we do any filming , we must rethink the love story and revamp the script . '' the only silver lining is that one day an intelligent film about an elder painter and a teenager girl falling in love may one day be made . if such a film ever appears , this it will be surely spark controversy , debate and questions for many years to come .
this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on . totally sucked . we saw it in omaha even . not funny at all , looks like a 14 year old kid wrote the humor . i ca n't believe these real politicians were actually in the movie . awful .
i am a great fan of the batman comics and i became disappointed when i could no longer find batman : the animated series on tv anymore . i was excited to learn that there was going to be a new batman cartoon on tv . i watched the first episode the day it premiered and i was very disappointed . first of all , the animation is very poor . it looks like a cheap , crappy japanese anime . then again , just about every modern-day cartoon is like that . the character designs are even worse . batman looks more like birdman , catwoman looks more like chihuahuawoman , bane looks more like a red version of the hulk , the penguin is a kung-fu master , mr . freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head , and the riddler is a gothic marilyn manson look-alike ( which is funny because i do n't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be gothic ) . the worst character design is that of the joker . they turned him into a monkey/demented bob marley/kung-fu fighter ! the joker is supposed to be batman 's deadliest enemy , but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless . in one episode his plan was to put his joker venom in dog food ! oh , how evil ! batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents , which is why he fights crime . this version of batman does n't seem haunted by his parents ' deaths and is not interesting at all . he 's also not a detective , just a fighter . if there 's an enemy he ca n't defeat , he wo n't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would , he 'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them . a lot of times this show does n't even feel like a batman show , just another brainless anime that 's nothing but pointless fighting . what i hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains . they 've taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys . man-bat is the biggest example . in the comics , he 's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness . when experimenting on himself , he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature . in this show , he 's a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason . just about all the villains are like that ; none of them , with the exception of about one or two , have an actual motive for their crimes . the worst characterization is that of mr . freeze . in the comics , freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer paul dini wrote the btas episode `` heart of ice '' , which gave freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic , three-dimensional , and likable villain . the episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin . even that crappy movie batman & robin used it as his origin . in this show , he 's a petty jewel thief before becoming mr . freeze . after becoming mr . freeze , guess what ? he 's still a petty jewel thief ! great origin . no wonder they used it over the one dini created . as a batman fan , i do n't dislike this show just because it is n't like the comics because i also liked btas , the batman cartoons that came after it , tim burton 's batman films , and obviously , the superb christopher nolan batman films . none of them were 100 % loyal to the comics , but they were still very good . the problem with this show is not that it 's not exactly like the comics or btas , it 's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other batman media so popular . i 've given this show so many chances , but the more i watch , the more i find that disappoints me . i miss the good old days back when batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy .
this movie is horrible . the acting is a waste basket . no crying , no action , hopeless songs . though the scenery is great . i have always wanted to go to greece . anyway , as for saif , you 'd expect a great performance , but even he let down the people . akshay kumar , recognized as the pimp of bollywood and the voice of singhs . he was sensational in this movie . for only this performance , filmfare should introduce another award . the toiletries award for the worst performance . by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat . kareena kapoor . she first of all is not comparable to her sister karisma . in acting , in looks , or in body . she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her . she comes into this movie wearing bikini 's and tank tops and short shorts . i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife-to-be dress like that . but , she must 've impressed some people dressing like that . and if you ask how , then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie . they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom . including me . personally i think that she dressed like a whore , but i really liked it . i am forced to give it a 1/10 , but i 'd really give this movie a 0/10 . an unachieved film .
adrian has just gone out of the asylum , being rich and with no parents , his life seems empty . one day , he meets gonzalo , a poor boy whom mother is prostitute . desperate for earning some money , gonzalo helps adrian to search about his life and who where his parents . this is a movie from a new director , and it is perfectly clear in most of the film : scenes not correctly directed , dialogues a little forced , some incoherences in the script ... anyway , the ending is unexpectedly well done ( well , just a little ) and that saves a little the film . actors are known and with great quality , nevertheless , they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting ; all of them have done better papers in other film . the film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends . of course there are lots of worse films , but , sure , there are many many better ones .
i watched this film not really expecting much , i got it in a pack of 5 films , all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect ? and you know what i was right , they were all terrible , this movie has a few ( and a few is stretching it ) interesting points , the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch , the drummer is very like a drummer , i.e damned annoying and , well thats about it actually , the problem is that its just so boring , in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension , a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious ( i had my thumb on the fast forward button , ready to press for most of the movie , but gave it a go ) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking , coz they do n't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot , i thought he looked a bit like a meercat , all this and i have n't even mentioned the killer , i 'm not even gon na go into it , its just not worth explaining . anyway as far as i 'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london ( who was actually quite funny ) it was n't because of their acting talent , i 've certainly seen a lot worse , but i 've also seen a lot better . best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry .
deathstalker is directed by john watson and it stars rick hill , who is some kind of body builder and famous of that , if i have understood right ? the plot follows as deathstalker ( hill ) tries to get something back from the evil lord , and he has to travel to the lord 's cave . he meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey , and the settings are very close to tolkien , and of course conan the barbarian . this is a rip off of huge success of conan , and even though this is very stupid film , it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies ! there are no many cinematic merits in this film . couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating , but what deathstalker concentrates to show , are nude females and huge muscles of hill . females are usually helpless victims and very stupid , too , so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists ! the fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull , and the monsters are not either anything special . and all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done , but what did you expect from low budget effort like this ? this tries to be as great as conan but fails pretty miserably . as i said , this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else . this belongs to the category it 's so bad it 's great ! deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be , and as a turkey film , i appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys , enjoyable ones of course ! if bad films are your cup of tea , then try this and have fun , but if you do n't understand `` enjoyably bad films '' then stay away . and if somebody ca n't stand large amount of nudity , then stay away as well . there is more nudity here than violence , and due to these scenes , the film has an r rating . otherwise this could be some safe pg family film ! 4/10
this should be re-titled `` the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non-horror snorer as a shock film . '' it 's one long , boring tale of a fraternity hazing , a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it . jeff east , an actor in the dues-paying stage , can be forgiven for taking any work he could get . the same ca n't be said for charles martin smith , who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah . once available on tape but , thankfully , not out on dvd . misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else .
please do n't waste your time . this movie rehashes the worst of bram stoker 's dracula ( van helsing ) , anne rice 's vampire lestat ( rock music and silly biblical references ) , and blade ( high-tech toys ) . i really like vampire movies and novels , and there are many out there that are very good . but not this stinker . not even the soundtrack helps it , mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the `` kick-ass metal '' some reported . only a few times did i hear any metal ; mostly it was tortured violins . avoid it like garlic and crucifixes .
this is the worst movie i have seen since `` i know who killed me '' with lindsey lohan . after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this . hey , tim burton , i used to be a big fan of yours ... did you even screen this movie ? i mean seriously , what the f % # k ? without giving anything away , here is the story in a vague nutshell ... nine wakes up , he does stuff , his actions and decisions are irrelevant ... and the movie ends . oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... spoiler alert ! spoiler alert ! at the end of the movie .... it rains . i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie .
before i begin , you need to know that i am a huge fan of many of sonny chiba 's films . his biographical series of the life of his master , mas oyama , were amazing and among the best martial arts films ever made , as were most of his street fighter films . the action was practically non-stop and with the possible exception of bruce lee ( depending on who you ask ) , he was the greatest martial arts practitioner on film during the 1970s . because they are so good , i 've seen at least 15 of his films and recently bought some more ( which i am in the process of watching ) . unfortunately , despite my love of these films , i am not a mind-numbed zombie who worships the man to such a degree that i rate every film a 10 . there are a few reviews like this here on imdb and i truly think that anyone giving this film a 10 should be ignored because this is such a bad film from a technical standpoint and is n't even close to the being chiba 's best work . a score of 10 is n't a real rating -- it 's some zombie fan trying to make a statement about chiba , not this film ! as i said , technically this film is awful . some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version , with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing . but most of the problem would still exist with the original japanese print . the camera-work is simply atrocious -- like it was done by chimps ( smart chimps , but still chimps nonetheless ) . often , much of the fast martial arts action is missed because the camera is so slow or the tops of the actors heads are clipped off due to the shoddiness of production . and , again and again , the camera pans in and out like it is a new toy being used by an idiot plus the editing is beyond wretched -- with cuts being done haphazardly and confusingly . i do n't know whether the musical score is original or not -- but it was also very , very bad . sort of like acid rock of 1970 blended poorly with ennio morricone 's `` spaghetti western '' music -- it was annoying , distracting and just plain silly . as for the martial arts action , i think that having chimps do the choreography would have improved things a bit . instead of the great fight scenes you 'd look forward to in a chiba film , the fights are too brief and often missed by the camera ! ! so what you are left with is the story ... and this might just be the worst part of the film ! it 's supposed to be an anti-drug film starring sonny chiba as .... sonny chiba ! and when the film begins , he vows to destroy the drug trade in japan . but , the mafia ( complete with not a single member who looks italian , but who are all japanese ) vows to stop chiba . and , when a lady comes to chiba with promises to give him information about how to destroy the drug trade , he agrees to help her and risk his life with no conditions -- even though she 's never forthright about telling him what she knows ! in fact , later it turns out she is just trying to use chiba to protect her while she herself sells a huge briefcase full of cocaine -- and he continues trying to protect her ! ! this makes no sense at all and throughout much of the film it looks as if they just shot the film without a script -- such as when they went into the bars and brothels and had chiba walking about as if he was drunk . so if it was that bad , why still does it merit a 3 ? well , first , there are many more horrid marital arts films ( such as many of those from hong kong in the 1970s ) -- including one with guys dressed up in gorilla suits doing kung fu and their handlers with 3 foot long tongues they used for fighting ( now that 's bad ) . second , while the action is very bad compared to other sonny chiba films , compared to its contemporaries , it 's not that bad . still , you could easily do a lot better than this horrid little film . by the way , if you are wondering if this is the worst sonny chiba film , it certainly is not ! in one of his first films , invasion of the neptune men , chiba plays a leotard-wearing super-hero who battles pointy-headed invaders from the planet neptune . it 's so bad that it rivals plan 9 from outer space and they saved hitler 's brain for awfulness . a final note to parents -- like most of sonny chiba 's films , this one is very violent and has its share of boobies . do n't let little kids watch this no matter how much they beg ! make them wait until they are older before you let them watch wretched rated-r martial arts films !
a man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50 's and that he now has the power to ... burst into flames ! i was really geared up for this film , what with being directed by the great toby hooper and staring wild card brad dourif . unfortunately it did n't rise above the average individual-with-violent-powers movie . spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it , unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much . the special effects are n't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale . the cast is n't bad , dourif does steal the show . all around , no classic but it 's not the worst of its kind either . * * out of * * * *
okay , i was bored and decided to see this movie . but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage , then basically that same hour repeated 4 times . it consists of 1 . gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan , 2 . flashbacks to the men 's wives 3 . the approach of the troops marching in a long line 4 . men running up hill and shooting , usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him . 5 . defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 . men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs . that was the basic movie , and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times . and every time it did a flashback to the wives , it would show the man , then his wife and him . there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time . other than that , the men could n't kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades . i liked the music and there was a lot of action , though the action was repetitive . overall , i probably would n't see it again , but it was n't too horrible .
good grief ! while i still maintain that manos : the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available , hobgoblins came awfully close . this ... this ... thing insults the audience at every opportunity . at least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on mst3k , this one was a struggle to get through . i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish . this thing managed to embarrass me - alone ! even if you are a die-hard mst3k fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment , think twice about seeing this one . it 's that bad .
in the ravaged wasteland of the future , mankind is terrorized by cyborgsrobots with human featuresthat have discovered a new source of fuel : human blood . commanded by their vicious leader jōb ( lance henriksen ) , the cyborgs prepare to overtake taos , a densely populated human outpost . only one force can stop jōb 's death marchthe cyborg gabriel ( kris kristofferson ) , who is programmed to destroy jōb and his army . in the ruins of a ransacked village , gabriel finds nea ( kathy long ) , a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by cyborgs ten years earlier . now she wants revenge . they strike a pact : gabriel will train nea how to fight the cyborgs and nea will lead gabriel to taos . five-time kick-boxing champion kathy long has all the right moves in this high-speed adventure that delivers plenty of action . also stars gary daniels ( as david ) and scott paulin ( as simon ) .
all the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character jim being either a bad father , a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish . how can that be funny ? of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed , but jim 's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner . and why it that ? my guess is that it 's because `` he should now better '' . jim 's not a stupid guy , he can take care of things and he 's got the opportunities to do so . but he chooses not to . it 's a conscious choice he makes , when he chooses to not play with his kids , not go shopping because he does n't want to buy `` lady products '' and it 's a choice he makes , when he puts down his relatives . the other characters seems to only be in the series so jim can have someone to be a jerk to . if the cheryl character was a real person , she would have left him years ago , and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years . but alas , she 's just a catalyst for jim 's quirky middle-class extreme selfishness .
despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating , this is an awful movie . awful enough , that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is . the movie is set in the final period of the raj , during the time of india 's fight for independence . what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief . what the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era . for instance , would the young married hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married englishman master , knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment ? unlikely , but still maybe . however , would the same young hindu housemaid , in the conservative society of india of that era carry on like a half naked britney spears in heat , partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment ? that is not only bloody unlikely , that is a retarded plot line . such idiocies combined with the poor acting , drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie , so i did not watch the second half of the movie . one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half .
in the standard view , this is a purely awful movie . however , it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale . i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie . andy griffith 's ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime . i would n't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it , but if you happen to be laying on the couch at 3 in the morning and it comes on tv , check it out .
once again , disney manages to make a children 's movie which totally ignores its background . about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names . the most glaring errors are the characters - penny does not have her book , brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop , dr claw is more a show-off than an evil villain , etc . but there are more than that . the horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having gadget as a security guard called john brown does n't help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget . and right in the beginning we see disney 's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce brenda , who only serves to make this movie disney-compatible . add to this the fact that the `` claw '' seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and you 'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline . what would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed , disney failed in that too . the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for silliness 's sake and lusting after brenda . as if to add insult to the injury , disney introduced the `` new '' gadgetmobile - it does n't look , function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all , it 's just the canonical `` comic relief '' figure . disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy , so they made the film a comedy too , but they took out all the clever running gags ( like the assignment paper exploding in the chief 's face ) and replaced them with gadget being a moron , the gadgetmobile being a wise-ass , and `` claw '' showing off . someone should tell disney that `` children 's movie '' does n't imply `` total lack of any brain usage '' . gadget should be targeted for children of 10-12 years ... not children of 10-12 months like this movie . whatever this movie is supposed to be , it is not , repeat not , the real inspector gadget . because i love the old gadget , i hate this .
terrible acting , lame plot , stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk . it was excruciating to sit through . just awful . do not waste one penny on this . the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch . this `` horror '' film was not even in the least bit scary , creepy or disturbing . it was in no way visually appealing . the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the actor/actress opening their mouth . plus the entire story , i do n't know why someone would make a movie with this story again . do not waste your time or money . even if it 's a free ticket do n't waste one moment viewing this movie . you will feel dumber for watching it .
i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster . being an adam sandler fan at the time , i rented it . honestly i could only watch about 30 mins . of it . it was terrible . do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public . i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon , and i hope it stays that way !
as has been noted , this formula has been filmed several times , most recently as `` you 've got mail '' , with tom hanks and meg '' trout pout '' ryan . of the several versions , this is my least favorite . the problem i think is that the studio coasted on the stars charisma , which does n't quite cut it here . the chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie . there are no real sparks . van johnson and judy garland remind me of day old donuts , pleasant but bland . and when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow . judy in particular is disappointing . she looks like she has no neck ! i do n't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it 's head into it 's shell , all hunched up and everything . i could n't figure out what van johnson was getting so hot about . i would have made a bee line for that cute violin player . and van was n't great either . i 've always thought of him as a rather generic hollywood leading man and he does n't do anything to dispel that image here . if you 're a fan of the stars or the early 1900 's then you might like this movie . but there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there , and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection .
you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  `` herbie : fully loaded with crap '' and yes it is true . this movie is really dreadful and totally lame . this got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen . the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie . i do n't see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie , is n't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it ? what i did n't like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle . i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining . little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable . final words : unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie . what wastage of my money . i feel like cheated . rating : 3/10 ( grade : f )
i 've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with michael jayston and sorcha cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment . i just did n't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars . a lot of staring and theatrical acting just does n't do it for me , and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester . had the casting director actually ever read the book . very strange ! he 's a fine actor but mr. rochester he definitely is n't ! and zelah was just , well , strange , bit of a mix matched couple . in it 's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation , but overall did n't capture any of the magic of the novel . certainly would n't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel . a real let down !
ok , but does that make this a good movie ? well , not really , in my opinion.there is n't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow , tediously , in fact.it 's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable , but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times , which i did n't really think fits this series and the character.jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he 's a decent enough actor , but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie , which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus , there were some pretty bad one liners.arnold vosloo returns in the title role , but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved , as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway , for me , while this movie is not abysmal , it is pretty bad.my vote for darkman iii : 3.5/5
when i first watched robotboy , i found it fresh and interesting , but then i noticed , that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself , what is good/bad . episodes became predictable . and main characters are not interesting . again we see a hyper-smart boy , beaten by his older brother , parents who do n't understand their kid , and his friends : girl and fat boy . also this show has no logic . a super-modern robot who works on two aa-size batteries , and can use a lot of weapons . but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes . we see two different robots , and it declines main idea of the show : `` robot must learn how to behave himself in human society ''
misty ayers had a smoking body , and that 's all this movie was about . pure exploitation flick . i started playing a game with myself , counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music . and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes . case in point : casually walking into a room and saying `` hello '' was scored with chase music from a roman epic . i 'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released . what i learned from this movie : that women 's low-rise panties existed in 1954 . i 'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties . at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing ( except for bra and panties , sadly ) . also includes horrendous dubbing , leading to a `` look out ! godzirra ! '' effect .
what did i just watch ? i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i 've ever seen . the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns .... but having it be a 300 pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre . i still am wondering how the character mark was n't able to run away from the clown ... he 's 300 pounds , he 's got ta get tired eventually . the whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud `` what did i just watch ? '' apparently brandon is denise 's cousin .... and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin ..... yeah that 's something people want so see * shudders * . another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says `` what did you do ? '' well bytch , what do you think he just did ? the last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch-hiker and calling her a c * nt and then 5 minutes later saying violence is n't helping anything .... did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy ? none of this movie makes sense anyway . the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying ( all 3.99 ) and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes . i 'm surprised the fat clown did n't join the orgy , would have fit right in . i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have , but i was wrong . this is a moronic piece of garbage that 's not even worth watching . 1 out of 10
i 'm not sure how related they are , but i 'm almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie ( or the story that it 's based on ) . very similar plotline , and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very , very similar . lost & delirious is actually a much better movie , so see that one instead . this one moves very slowly , but being a late 60s french movie , that is to be expected of the style . told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school . the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first , particularly since the audio from each overlaps ( ie , hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa ) . also , the `` girls '' are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school . finally , not much character development to even get you attached to the movie .
be warned ! this is crap that other crap wo n't even deign to be in company with because it 's beneath them ! okay , got that out of the way , let me say something more substantive . i 've seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director , wong kar wai . well , despite of all of that wkw has n't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans ; mostly it is just shots of dripping water , beads of sweats , legs of horses running , etc . i could n't sit through most of the movie . fast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr. wong 's movies another shot after hearing many praises , especially from cannes . i was intrigued by his latest , 2046 . a friend told me to start w/ chungking express because it is his most accessible movies . so wrong ! i was just p.o . that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness . some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city , blah , blah , blah . it 's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it . but no , he merely shows what is . faye wong 's acting is very typical of hong kong 's style : garbled enunciation , deer in the headlight wide eye expression , try to be cute and girlish kind of acting ; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired . i think the word , auteur , is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different , which is to be applauded , but not one who has n't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling , which is what mr. wong is , for the last 17 years !
the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub ! this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of `` real '' uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public . i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a mystery . worse than the worse low budget `` b '' film of the 50 's . an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get back . avoid it like the veritable plague .
where to start ? ok , do n't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous . if it was even a patch on fight club , the violence , blood , gore etc would be much more evident and realistic . secondly , this film is no football factory - which is so much more real ( and danny dyer makes nicholas nickelby look like an embarrassment ) . fair enough , the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add . but the film on the whole is poor , seriously poor . as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error , or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some american/geordie was playing the role . do n't get me wrong , good looking guy , who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan . i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward ' situation . also , when the gse are going to play united up north , they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - does n't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs , which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people . in terms of accuracy - did west ham and milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together ? hmm , ten years ok. and i 'm sure 'bother ' would be able to just waltz into a milwall firm pub . basically , a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football , and hooliganism . if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism , , you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence . ross george
one of the worst films i have ever seen . got so bored that i switched it off midway through to watch the news . when i switched it back on , i fell asleep . the film starts with a dream , continues with a dream , and ends with a dream . then there are a few more dreams in between . come on , what is supposed to keep me interested in that ? a film needs to have a reason to be interesting . the minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film-goer switches off . ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them ? this is it ! ! ! absolutely awful .
shame on julia roberts and john cusack . they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie . the storyline was dumb and predictable . the jokes were not funny . the romance was not really romance . i was all too happy when this movie ended .
me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good . but we were wrong . first of the acting .... wow ... the acting was the worst , the effects were really bad as well , it seemed like a film a college kid made . the plot was pretty good , but it 'd been done . the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors . the main guy was the worst actor ever ... it 's a shame i 'm even calling him an actor ... the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh see it .... but other than that ... stay far away from this one . i usually love b list movies and such , but this one ... i do not know how it was passed to even be put on video ... this one is the worst i 've seen .. and i 've seen some bad ones .
this is a terrible , terrible film ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! first of all tooo long . the longest movie i have ever seen . the stories are all too damn over the top ! ! ! ! as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined . the comedy was n't comedy ! ! ! ! ! it was n't funny at all .... the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die ....... i had some expectations from this movie ......... but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes ...... the only thing good about this movie is the music ...... and obviously vidya balan . she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors ...... she 's just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic ! ! ! ! ! govinda and the blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie . govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver . and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance .... another talented actress ayesha takiya is completely wasted in this movie ! ! ! ! so is priyanka ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top ! ! ! ! ! anil and juhi are also totally wasted ...... the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! all in all this is a very impossible movie with mishmashed screenplay and tooo masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes . imagine how stupid this movie is ! ! ! ! ! ! 3/10 it is four hours long ! ! ! ! think and rethink before going to the cinemas ! ! ! ! ! better avoid it ! ! ! ! !
i am not an artistically inclined individual . i am a science minded woman and i felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget . i watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter . we tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest . my fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to ocean 's 13 , but that is another story . not to be deterred i awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot . i began again watching this movie in earnest . i just do n't get it , i thought i would get it.i thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers . interesting and still it had dead stuff inside . it was an odd and bizarre movie . maybe this is what they were after , however i wo n't be tricked a second time !
you 'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it . however , this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light . it talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions armstrong 's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle , as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other . it makes the computer overload problem ( the 1202 and 1201 alarms ) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all . and it takes the `` thirty seconds '' call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out , when it 's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory . if you want to see a documentary or dramatization of apollo 11 , go for `` from the earth to the moon '' or one of the pbs documentaries , but skip this one .
i hated this movie . it was absolutely horrible , poor , poor , pitiful acting , real real real stupid criminals that were n't even the least bit funny ( unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good ) . all the boobie traps are weak , pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck did n't go above 20 bucks a week . this movie is absolutely lousy , it 's not worth even renting . in fact do n't even watch it on t.v. ! go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two ! i barely give this 1 star ( out of 10 ) . just trust me when i say , if you liked the first two , and you are not a complete stupid person , you will not like this movie , do not watch this movie ! ! !
i saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70 's whenever it reared it 's head like a reindeer with rabies every november-december as a saturday matinée kiddie show.it was always stiff competition for the chrstmas that almost was n't ( oops-can i say `` christmas '' ? ) , perhaps the greatest , most iconic christmas-season film of all time.but that 's another review . at the time , i marveled that the on-screen tint of santa claus was almost `` pink and white '' , so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color . the film is kinda creepy ! i thought so then -- and still do , actually . i was highly entertained then , as i still am ! it 's amusing in a `` retarted-elf '' sort of way . by the way , the image quality looks much better on the dvd i have now than it did in the theater , circa 1969-74 . if you are expecting maybe `` the lost rankin-bass christmas special-forget it ! if you want fellini does christmas -- read on ... by nature , the dubbing on these foreign films ( the original version here was in spanish ) always makes them seem `` surreal '' . this adds to the films inherent oddness . it is also pretty scary in that a `` mishevious demon '' ( as described in the original us trailer ) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids `` evil '' . one particularly nightmarish scene has a young `` latch-key '' boy wishing he had parents for christmas-suddenly the `` port-a-family '' emerges out of giant `` christmas presents-of-the-mind '' until he realizes he 's just daydreaming ! see this , christmas lovers -- and if you 're a stoner , save your stash -- this film will make you think you 're hallucinating ... without drugs !
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance ? i want a refund ... can i have my $ 16 back ? while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen , nothing did happen . the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot , which was not really like the film . why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out ? it was not very artistic . why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes ? why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading ? or was that the point ? i felt like phantom love had no story at all , and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film .
although it 's an r rated movie , i really doubt that you 'll really enjoy it unless you 're a teenager why ? because there 's no real plot , no character development , no funny jokes . the only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity . tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks ( pretty nice ones i might add ) to feast your eyes on . i really ca n't understand why this movie has the american pie title since it 's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them . my suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks , but you 're too shy to rent/buy an erotic movie . gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks
i was n't really fond of the first `` cube '' movie . it was a good idea , but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much . did n't really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original . i was intrigued , thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original 's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters . well i thought wrong . `` cube zero '' starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the cube . the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men 's daily routine . several questions are created from it , concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation . all of which are left entirely to the viewer . the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie 's first half moved relatively well . with the story moving on , one of the two `` watchers '' begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing . and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped . here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese . sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character `` jax '' . along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure . to start of `` jax '' looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever `` popular '' glass eye , that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half 's relatively nice pace . whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie . with some incredibly corny lines , perhaps the screenwriter got bored and did n't care . the acting itself degrades to a further low when the former `` watcher '' meets the group in the cube . the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it . again failing to impress on anything but weak characters , dialog and acting `` cube zero '' is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie .
what starts out as a gentle country yarn , inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton 's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister , as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western . an amiable rancher ( norton ) wanders into town and charms a young girl ( evan rachel wood ) , seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance , but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye . edward norton  a real chameleon actor ( with changing facial hair to match ) playing a country hick , accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he 's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent . he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan . however , with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from , and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused . evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton . down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace , and by never really making the protagonist 's motives clear the audience 's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain . should we like this drifter or not ? even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear . this ambiguity is to the film 's detriment , as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch . had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film , but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess . fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone . completist fans of norton aside ( or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley ) , give this a miss .
my wife and i just finished this movie and i came onto to imdb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory . however , of the 10 pages of reviews , only a handful are negative . i feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and i want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future . i admit , i 'm more inspired to write reviews when i do n't like a movie than as to when i do , so my handful of reviews are all negative . still , that does n't mean i 'm biased towards not enjoying a movie , but i often find more eloquent reviews of movies i do enjoy . paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie i 've seen in years . by using an `` intelligent '' concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the way to many short stories , the movie ends up the worst of all worlds . it is art for arts sake , but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish . giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment . directors ca n't write , writers ca n't direct . ( i 'd like to throw in also that clint eastwood is overrated , but that is because he 's an actor turn director { which rarely works , either } ) . what ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that do n't make any sense , are not completed in 5 minutes and in total , spoil paris to me . why call it paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f * ck ? there are only a couple stories that are watchable , most notably the piece by alfonso cuarón , but everything else will fall into obscurity . the coen brothers short is passable , but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar ? it 's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose paris as the place to do it . as we all love paris , present company included , we are blinded by the fact that this movie sucks . in fact , i think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes . seriously . seriously . people , natalie portman is not a good actress . she is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours . and maggie gyllenhaal , why ? ! ? are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies ? i 'm looking at you natalie portman ( garden state , closer ) , elijah wood ( sin city ) and catalina sandino moreno ( maria full of grace ) . one final comment on the acting : i give double kudos to nick nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again . find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable . writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right . i 'm thinking of ernst hemingway , raymond carver , f. scott fitzgerald , and john cheever , just to name a few . it is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this . the same can be said about short films . it appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history . if you uphold paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story , then do n't expect to enjoy this movie at all . the directors either did n't care or were lazy . in either scenario , by the time you are reading this it means you rented it . praise be that you did n't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it .
scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick ( tim young ) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike . the poor kid suffers daily humiliation , bullying , teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers . unfortunately he does n't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid . however something magical happens ( no , the film does n't suddenly become good ) , lester 's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell ... co-written , co-produced & directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr. duforq although i do n't remember any character of this name , i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it 's terrible reputation & i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it 's terrible . the script by itier , bill cunningham & jason white uses the often told story of one of life 's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick . we 've seen it all before , we 've seen killer scarecrows before , we 've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before , we 've seen one of life 's losers get his revenge before , we 've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we 've seen incompetent small town sheriff 's make matters even worse before . the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it 's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level ? the answer is a resounding no to be honest . the film has terrible character 's , awful dialogue , an inconsistent & predictable story , it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask 's 'can you dig it ? ' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame . the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it is n't that exciting & the kills are forgettable . you know i 'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn ... director itier does n't do a particularly good job here , the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there 's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off . also i 'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix ( 1999 ) or some japanese kung-fu flick ! to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit . do n't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring ? i know he 's a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day ! there 's no nudity & the gore is n't anything to write home about , there 's a decapitation , someones face is burnt , someone is killed with a stick of corn , someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat , some sickles are stuck in people 's heads , someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth . with a supposed budget of about $ 250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days , well at least they did n't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development . technically this is pretty much point , shoot & hope for the best stuff . if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing ... the acting sucks , the guy who played lester 's mum 's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & do n't get me started on his accent ... scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made , badly acted , silly , too predictable & very cheesy . if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows ( 1988 ) . not to be confused with the gene hackman & al pacino film scarecrow ( 1973 ) or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow ( 2008 ) which is currently in production . scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels , scarecrow slayer ( 2003 ) & scarecrow gone wild ( 2004 ) .
peter sellers ( one of my favorite actors ) is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey , but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie hawn 's youth ( just after her oscar win ) can not begin to pull this one out of the mud . as a skirt-chasing celeb in his 40 's , sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth degree . a 3 out of 10 . best performance = ? nicky henson plays a young study type . i hope hawn and sellers were paid well , because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 ( a very good year for films - catch-22 , m.a.s.h. , husbands , joe , wusa , five easy pieces and many others ) . you ca n't win them all !
oscar wilde 's comedy of manners , perhaps the wittiest play ever written , is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast . sanders is , as one would expect , casually , indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington , but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time . jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy ; indeed , the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the hays office insisted . preminger 's direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal . stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs. erlynne ; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words . but skip this version .
first off ... i never considered myself an uwe boll hater since i think i never even saw one of his movies but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie named `` seed '' ( which is the name of the serial killer this movie is about ) i am close to joining the hate club . this movie makes absolutely no sense at all ... the plot is a joke and although boll clearly tries to get attention by shocking people 90 % of this movie is just plain boredom . you can sum up this movie like this : 1 . hooded killer watches clips of animals getting tortured on tv . this is real life footage from pelt farms and the movie opens with the ridiculous reason of `` making a statement about humanity '' and giving a peta address . since this movie has no message at all and is the worst piece of torture porn-exploitation you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning onward . 2 . death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this movie printed on screen so every retard gets it . 3 . cops watch videos of animals , babies and women starved to death and decomposing in seeds basement , having stupid nightmares and crying into their whiskey because seed is such an evil bad mofo . although the acting is ok the movie takes a dive every time it tries to incorporate any emotions ... 4 . cops bust seed in his house , act stupid and get slashed in the dark . this sequence reminds me of a video game , you barely see anything except flashlights . seed is a super killer that is everywhere at once and all cops act stupid enough to be killed ... except for one who busts him . 5 . seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as lengthy as everything else in this `` movie '' ... he wo n't die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he must be set free if he survives 3 electric jolts . guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem . 6 . seed comes out of his grave , kills everyone off in another slashing part and then seeks the main cop to take revenge on . 7 . a woman gets her head bashed in with a hammer in an endless sequence from one point of view just for the fun and shock value of it . 8 . seed captures the cops family , lures him to his house , threatens to kill his wife and daughter . after killing his wife with a nail gun the cop shoots himself in the head considering thats whats seed wants ( its hard to get into that guys head since he not just wears his mask even in prison but also never utters a word ... the movie has barely any dialog anyway so do n't mind ) . 9 . boll goes for a nihilistic shocker end where seed locks the daughter in with her dead dad to rot like the persons we saw on video on sequence 3 . this is it ... no message , no plot , no reason , no face behind the mask , no background except a stupid story that seed was burnt as a child . this movie relies purely on few key scenes and their shock value . i hardly remember a movie this empty of any emotion or message or entertainment . its like watching august underground ... thats fine with me , some people will enjoy this brainless snuff . but what is really hard to stand about it is the pseudo-message in the beginning and the fact that the movie is well made considering camera-work , effects and even the acting is too good for this waste of celluloid . so how does boll get money to make such `` movies '' when thousands of talented directors work on shoestring budgets ? ? `` seed '' is not just the essence of ridiculous , its living proof that the free market is flawed ... lucky uwe that the german taxpayer is paying for a lot of this waste to get deductments .
this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen . i could n't care less about any of the characters ; susan walters was so annoying , and the leading actor ( forget his name ) also got on my nerves . ca n't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film , things did n't quite carry off . my dad told me it 's s stupid movie ... i should 've listened to him .
live ! yes , but not kicking . true story : some time ago , a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show . a contest rather . the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure . for real . the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd , saying it was appalling , immoral , what-is-this-world-coming-to , and the like . in a way , i had to agree . as the months passed , the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not , instead of running the country . the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead . and up to the last moment the country was up in arms , the prime minister making speeches , every newspaper writing about it , everyone in the country holding their breaths . and the network pushed on . towards a new frontier in television . and they definitely succeeded in doing just that . they pushed the envelope . the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live , whilst she would die shortly after . and then , in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax . the woman was not ill , but all the candidates were . there was no kidney auction . the whole show , that , with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions , built up for months to a fantastic climax , was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors . the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease . now this is television . leaving everybody far behind in amazement . do n't give me a poorly acted , poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv . as if . * spoiler * as if i 'm going to believe they would get this through the fcc . as if i 'm going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression . as if i 'm gon na believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air . it 's all been done before . watch running man with arnold instead . at least it had a semi good ending . * spoiler * this is an appallingly bad piece of film , together with a ridiculous ending . so she gets shot in the end , is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice ? do n't take my word for it , but i would say this : leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead , you 'll get more quality .
seriously , what is this ? hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre , then he made this god awful film , what happened ? did he dip into the crack a little too much ? this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on fire , ( firestarter , anyone ? ) the acting was godawful , the plot was rubbish , and the special effects were extremely rubbish , they looked like something from the 70 's . van damme should be pleased that derailed is no longer the worst film ever , and what was with the ending ? he started glowing blue , turned into a glowing blue blob , sucked out his girlfriends fire , and the film ended . what was that ? huh ? when the film ended i hoped the dvd would spontaniously combust to save me from my pain . stay away from this film . do n't think , obey , you 'll thank me later .
a good cast and they do their best with what they 're given , but the story makes no sense , the characters ' actions are inexplicable , and there are too many moments of unintentional humor , as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off . the scene when the two witch and her victim ( played by the same actress ) are in the house together sets up like a 3 stooges routine , and the plot begs the question : if the witch wants to possess this other woman 's soul , why does n't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase ? not to be missed is christopher walkin 's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife ( paraphrased ) : `` the ancient egyptianas - they wee materialists . they expected the body to last through eternity , like a used car that you souped up . but the druids , they knew you could n't drive in the afterlife . you had to get out and walk . '' huh ? the ending is absolutely indecipherable . seems like they just ran out of film .
the most horrible retelling of a great series . it should not have been named battlestar galactica , because it 's only the same in name alone . too many changes to just have changes . you have characters turned from male to female , black to asian to cylon all in a way to `` attract female audiences , '' when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger . gone are the egyptian feeling . gone are the quest for earth . the lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film , especially when one is made a fembot . granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it , but it had a large following . they tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it `` their own story . '' changes are good , when they make something better , not to just make them .
'the curse of frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to mary shelley 's story for one word of the title , which would n't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with ... nothing . the heart and moral centre of the story is gone . it does n't help that this frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichés . even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . as it 's the first of hammer 's horror films , directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee , its place in horror history is secure . but it 's crap .
bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress . on the other hand , starting in the 1980s , actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood , so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake edwards ' `` 10 . '' that is if she had n't allowed her husband , john derek , to take over her career . numerous playboy spreads and bad movies like this one ( this one in particular ) directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke . in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold . john figured that putting bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype . maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps . this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of burrough 's lord of the jungle , a slap in the face to character 's book and film legacy . tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for bo 's breasts and richard harris ' wonderful over acting ( remember , the pair had worked together in orca ) . his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes , the film is quite boring . nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance . bo 's body can only get you so far . miles o'keeffe who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs , but bo and john derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first place . and how did the orangutan get to africa ?
i saw this film first in the soviet union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee . but then , in poland in 2000 , i watched it in a complete form . and so what ? the plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong , straight and fundamentally severe ladies . the men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive , constant masculine desire for sex , feminists who are shown like complete idiots ( you may agree with them or not , but idiots certainly they are not ) , and so on . the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like `` i am in the elevator with a nude chick and i have n't done anything to her ! '' . this was intended to be a comedy , instead , it turned out to be a vapid farce , full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos . do not waste your time on it - this is just bad .
this british film is truly awful , and it 's hard to believe that glenn ford is in it , although he pretty much sleepwalks through it . the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film ! no action , no movement , just a static train . the area where the train is parked is evacuated , so it 's not like there 's any danger to anyone either . in fact , this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film . true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters do n't , a fact apparently unknown to the director . spoiler : the train actually has two bombs on it , but we are led to believe there is only one . after the first bomb is defused , it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more . but at the last minute , the villain , who has no apparent motivation for his actions , reveals there are two . nor are we certain when the bombs will go off , so we do n't even have a classic `` ticking bomb '' tension sequence . a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn ford 's french wife thinking about leaving him , and then wondering where he is . she 's such an annoying character that we do n't care whether she reconciles with him , so when she does , there 's nothing emotional about it . most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality , and none have any problems or issues . it 's only 72 minutes , but it feels long because it 's tedious and dull . do n't waste your time .
when 'my deja vu , my deja vu ' aired last season , i was pleased . scrubs , i thought , is doing something clever and unique in regards to the clip-show concept . instead of replaying footage , they 're replaying jokes in a self-aware manner , and i really enjoyed it . i found it really unfortunate that i was wrong . one season later , they succumbed to that which almost all sitcoms inevitably do , the clip show ... and it looked like it was put together by the work-experience kid . dr cox 's shaved head shows just how lazy the editors were in putting it together , as it does n't appear again until 'my long goodbye ' some 4 episodes later . i ca n't imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-constructed sitcom . who knows why it was slotted there , it just seemed lazy and out of place , reminding me ( largely ) of episodes that have aired within the past year . three second clips jammed together with background music is a dvd extra for a ( very ) rainy day , not an episode of prime-time television .
yeah , madsen 's character - whilst talking to the woman from the tv station - is right : the lapd is a corrupt , violent and racist police . and this movie changes nothing about it . okay , here are the good cops , the moral cops , even a black one , whow , a christian , a martyr . but this is a fairy tale , admit it . reality is not like that . and most important for the action fans : the shoot out is boring . it 's just shooting and shooting and shooting . nothing more . play counter strike , then you will at least have something to do . the only moral of this film is : the lapd is good now . no more bad cops in it . if you like uncritical , euphemistic commercials for police and military service , watch this movie . it 's the longest commercial i 've ever seen . ( 2 points for camera and editing ) .
the british claymation series putting `` witty '' conversations taped from `` average '' people in the mouths of `` cute '' fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non-british viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you could n't get on u.s. television . someone made the mistake of putting it on u.s. television . sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit-com coupling which died in a month on nbc when the same basic scripts did n't `` translate '' from british english to american english , what seemed droll and cultured ( and just a bit dull ) in england , comes across in creature comforts , the american version , as simply boredom with puppets . there 's no through plot-line , no characters and after one and a half episodes watched ( of the three ultimately aired ) , no reason to suffer through more . the only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set-up for the single worst show on the cbs schedule , the new adventures of old christine ( or `` how to be a horrible mother - or person - in one interminable , unfunny lesson '' ) , kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show , and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when `` two and a half men '' ( guilty pleasure ) and `` how i met your mother '' ( actual quality writing ) come on .
i am a huge fan of david lynch . this film , however , was a quite disappointing experience . apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that i 've come to associate with lynch 's work . the visuals are dull , to say the least , and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest . this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director . i 've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work , scenery , sound and script . this film lacks almost all artistic qualities . i feel as though i 'm watching one of davids home videos , produced during a weekend trip with some friends .
the progression of the plot is enough to `` rope one in '' and create curiosity about the outcome . however , ultimately , the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it . if the intention was to create a perpetual circle ( occasionally done in the twilight zone ) , it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort .
i thought harvey keitel , a young , fresh from the sex pistols john lydon , then as a bonus , the music by ennio morricone . i expected an old-school , edgy , italian cop thriller that was made in america . istead , i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying : wtf ! ! ! too many unanswered questions , and not enough action . the result : a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet . keitel and lydon work well together , so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script . oh , and the morricone score : ok , but not memorable . overall , not a waste of time , but not a `` must see '' , unless you are a hardcore keitel fan .
- a newlywed couple move into the home of the husband 's dead former wife . it 's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone does n't want her in the house . she sees skulls all around the house . but when the husband investigates , he ca n't find anything . is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from ? or , is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house ? - this is the first time that i 've watched the screaming skull without the assistance of the mst3k crew . and , it will in all likelihood be the last time i watch it this way . can you say dull ? i 'm not talking ordinary dull - i 'm talking watching grass grow dull . there are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens . the screen could have gone blank and i would have gotten as much entertainment out of it . the characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable . the screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide . - the actors do n't help matters much . most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play . i have n't looked it up , but i would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value . i wo n't even go into the script the actors are given to work with . let 's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film . - you 've been warned ! either avoid this one at all costs or , at least , seek out the mst3k version .
i am going to keep this short.this `` adaption '' of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more.of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and , as a result , this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250 . jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall.the story , that has nothing to do with the book , is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes . my advice to anyone that has n't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story : stick to the tv series .... oh , and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is ... not a good writer should stick to reviewing `` masterpieces '' like `` eyes wide shut '' .
this u.s soap opera , 'knots landing ' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator . every episode contained plots such as rape , murder , kidnapping and drug smuggling , not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period . as for the cast , i 've seen better actors on a cereal box . from the mid to late '90 's , repeats of 'knots ' stunk up u.k-gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies . i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously . though since then , re-runs have been few and far between ( let 's hope it stays that way ) . the only positive thing that can be said of 'knots ' is the catchy saxophone signature tune , later used as the title music for the i.t.v sitcom , 'the upper hand ' . great legacy that , eh ?
i have seen already fantastic stories , but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous . a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage , and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him . even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls ? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son . there is no shade of suspense or thrill , just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life . this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume , fabulous jessica alba and super-gifted lena olin . all would have deserved a better story .
while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing , i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery . perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age : the movie was made , as it is now 2002 , an official five years ago -- after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings , and science fiction feats like star wars , as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer 's the odyssey . my beef , basically , is that i could n't relate -- i am just about the same age of the children ( a young adult ) , and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available . but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence . i did n't find myself saying 'ack ! i would have done the same thing ! ' . it did not open the doors to my imagination . even without comparing it to high-budget films or other tv movies , standing alone , certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche : the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking , seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run . even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement : a typical set of one or the other stereotypes . there was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious , accompanied by mr . perfect image of combining athletics , good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude , and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days . while i know the personalities pushed the story along , i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable -- and believable ( as far as character ) -- movie . i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design -- that made it worth finishing to the end for me . do n't get me wrong : all movies are worth seeing for yourself , and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many , but i think that with a little more depth to the script , and a little more ( i can not believe i am saying this ) realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical .
i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out aug 3rd . it stars andy samberg from saturday night live as 'hot ' rod kimble . he 's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father . when we meet him , he 's jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped , yes , a mo-ped , and almost makes it . this would be worthy of a 'jackass ' movie if he was n't honestly trying to do this . isla fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl-next-door , denise . she seems to like rod enough to join his 'crew ' . jorma taccone ( also snl ) plays his half brother , kevin , who documents the stunts with a camcorder . sissy spacek plays rod 's mom , marie . she remarried frank powell , played by ian mcshane . frank 's a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out brawls . it 's clear that rod 's not going to earn frank 's respect till he can beat him . we find out frank needs a $ 50,000 . heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he 'can beat his ass ' once he 's healed , and prove himself a man . a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to 'go big ' on one stunt . rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life . like the human torch- at a children 's birthday party . there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts . just when all hope and money is lost , along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses rod wants to jump . he gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations . rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle . the whole town turns out and the world tunes in . does he make the jump ? does he get the girl ? do they raise the $ 50k ? does frank get his ass beat by rod ? wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out .
for those who 'd like to see this movie ? i 'd say : go ! without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary . but the music , the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me . following several animals , their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we 're watching . but the melodramatic point of view just does n't cut it for me , moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey ( one exception left there ) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene . i ask myself why that happens , if they were to show reality , why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains ? i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd , cause after all : it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet .
i still ca n't believe this movie . they got so much unbelievable things in it , that it 's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it . the story is a joke , but in the sense of being funny , but more like no story at all . how can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery , a prison movie , town conspiracies , sex-jokes and a fbi-agent ? you ca n't . beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors . i watched this film and thought : 'is this really marlon brando ? no , it ca n't be . ( 5 minutes later ) is this charlie sheen ? wow , maybe brando is true . ( 5 minutes later ) this ca n't be donald sutherland . ( 5 minutes later ) no , not mira sorvino . this movie is too bad for all of them . ( at the end ) . no , no , no , this ca n't absolutely not be martin sheen ! ! ! not for 10 seconds of such a movie . ' then it was over and i down with my nerves . so many good , oscar-winning , usually convincing actors in such a stupid , dumb , awful movie . i rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one . they could n't got so much money . only just an unbelievable silly idiotic movie . 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 ( 1+ - 6- )
i saw this film for the first time not too long on tcm 's `` essentials '' series . the eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos . this beholder saw little of value in this one . i was puzzled by the infinite attraction that lucy ( lauren bacall ) possessed . granted , ms. bacall was a beautiful woman , but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive . i would think men like mitch wayne and kyle hadley would more likely ignore lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her . in bacall 's defense , this film was made at the time of humphrey bogart 's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance . of course part of this mousiness on the part of lucy was to contrast her to slutty marylee , played to the hilt and beyond by dorothy malone . the scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film . malone 's performance outshines the rest , although jasper hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by robert keith . generally , though , i would have to say that i 'm just not much of a fan of melodrama . the cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes .
the world may have ended . unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canada 's inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable . maybe it 's because all our really good people ( norman jewison , martin short et al ) go to hollywood . ) in fact it 's too bad short was n't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film . he might have given it some credibility . the canadian government should realize -- - and this movie is a magnificent example -- - that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema . if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete , they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile . as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment .
satan 's little helper is one of the better b horror movies i have seen . when i say better i mean the story . the film hatches a new plot , something that 's not so cliché in the horror genre - something fresh . but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it . questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie . the film first caught my attention while i was cruising the horror section in hmv . i was tired of all the so called `` terrifiying '' hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different . the cover art for satan 's little helper immediately caught my attention . as you can see , the image draws you in - it 's chilling ! i knew it was a straight to dvd release - but i took a chance . i mean , i just seen `` boogey man '' the night before - so it could n't get any worse ! after i watched the movie , i was semi-satisfied . i loved the plot of the movie . it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend , so he could kill . in some sick deranged way , he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners - a duo of terror . it was a great idea to set the film on halloween night . this way , no one would think anything of a masked man beside a little kid . they would simply think he was his guardian . but , this is also where the `` plot holes '' begin to surface . if your son came home with a `` friend '' he met trick or treating - that 's fine . you would n't think anything of it - if he was 9 ! , or round about the same age as him . if however , he appeared with a strange man in a mask , you would be startled and protective of your child . you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself . you would ask why he is with your son . he does n't know him . you would tell him to please leave . he is n't a family friend . he 's a stranger . now , we 're supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers . in this case , the mum is completely fine with it . huh ? they never seem to think it 's a tad odd that the `` man '' does n't speak - at all . gruanted they think it 's the daughters boyfriend , but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he 's not saying a word . the film goes down hill from there . the thing that got me the most was , all the mum said was `` do you want some cider ? '' . i ca n't count how many times she says this in the movie . it 's like , oh you 're dying - we have cider though , it 's all good ! ! the movie started promising , and failed to deliver . it was more of a horror/comedy , and even as that it fails to deliver . i guess you could call it a `` dud '' , '' flop '' etc .. the best thing about the movie is the cover art . though , something tells me that 's not worth the 12 dollars !
good deaths . good mask . cool axe . good looking girls .... but watch out ! ! ! no plot and little scares completely lower it 's standards . they tried to make an `` i know what you did last summer '' , but ended up making a `` scream '' . but hey , what do people expect from a horror movie ? answers totally vary . rent it if you want , but i regret ever seeing it .
well , awful is just the first name . this movie is a cliché-ridden piece of junk . a high school comedy setup in a military training camp . i 'm sorry i had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve . this may contain spoilers : just about everything is totally forced , unconvincing and unrealistic . the hepo ( military police ) will not come to get you if you do n't make your appearance , especially not on your wedding day . the actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene , because the scene did n't work as it was so highly unlikely . you can sense it in their voices . even if they were not such bad actors , they would n't have been able to save the scene . next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit . no , there was no time to get him an uniform first . man , this is great cinematography ! i will remember this scene for the rest of my life . there are also girls in the camp -- exciting -- one of'em even a model , though not looking that great -- and the baddest actress i 've ever seen . i doubt in hollywood they would let her say a single line in a b movie . okay girls in the military ! now this is getting fun . the girls are even placed on the same floor , so we can sneak to their room at night ! in reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away , separated by two fences with barbed wire . there are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time , of which we have plenty . no , the tanks are not locked , and the ignition keys are inserted . no one will notice the engine sounds , especially not at night . there is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line . we need those so the sexually obsessed germans will like the movie as well . switzerland is too small a market for any feature film . well done ! one sex scene takes place in the kitchen . surely , none of those facilities are ever locked . the military routines are as sloppy as they can get . in the end of the brainless flick , the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him ! because he deserted his fiancée ! sure i buy that , the italians are that way -- a jealous bunch ( not ) . the bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses . not at night in a dark alley . again , military training grounds ( where there is shooting with live ammo ) are open to the public , anyone can freely drive or walk in there . there are no such things as guards or fences . the deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the italians ' car . the explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiancée off their feet . no one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens . it 's a comedy , remember . okay . it 's a comedy , i got that , and i can live with that . no realism needed . filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously , side splitting funny , or entertaining , interesting , challenging . unfortunately it is none of those . it 's just embarrassing . a rip-off from brainless american comedies . the latter are at least done professionally , with no amateur actors . it is pretty boring and predictable , a waste of time and energy , especially to those sitting through the entire movie as i unfortunately did . yawn .
the effect achieved in this story about a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is so mannered that i have to assume that that was the desired intent . the sets are artificial and at no time did i not feel that i was watching a movie . it seemed like the actors were just reading their lines , rather than responding to one another . while the film has elements of early film noir ( except that it is in color ) the approach is so exaggerated that i almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre . given that the presentation had no appeal to me , i was at least expecting an engaging story . usually i am pretty slow on the uptake when it comes to stories with plot twists , but you could see what was coming here within the first fifteen minutes . by the time of the , `` gee , i forgot the $ 80,000 , '' moment , i thought to myself that this thing is truly ridiculous . for a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is beyond belief . if at any stage she had behaved like a normal intelligent person , the whole story would have fallen apart . this wooden production left me cold .
national treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come . nicholas cage is in no way a believable action hero , and this film is no `` indiana jones '' . people who have compared this movie to the indian jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker . i ca n't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for . maybe the pre-teen audience will like it , but i found it to be absolutely ludicrous . i also ca n't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film . simply put : it 's just ok at best . national treasure is unimagined and uninspired , borrowing what it does have from `` the da vinci code '' . i would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 , and passing on this nonsense . the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it ( while never damaging it once ) , while fighting the `` bad guys '' and experiencing what is supposed to be `` non-stop action '' is absurd . i particularly loved the scene with the declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it . oh brother ! reminded me of that episode of the `` brady bunch '' where they go to the amusement park and mr. brady loses his architectural plans . except , that episode of the brady bunch was much better than this whole film ! the idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the us is outlandish . literally , there are thousand of undiscovered `` priceless '' items in this treasure trove . yeah right ! ! ridiculous ! ! even worse , the speed and accuracy of which cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be `` tough '' clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous ! ! ! oh .. the humanity ! the performances by cage , voight , and the other actors in `` national treasure '' are as stiff , wooden , and flat as they come . however , when you 're working with such lousy dialogue , it 's hard to fault the actor 's 100 % for that . national treasure is an ok film to see once . i ca n't recommend it beyond that and would definitely not purchase this over the top , outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess . rent it if you must see it first .......
this movie was the worst movie i have seen since `` date movie . '' i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example , the eye , the tongue , the butt , the breast . if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite . for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . i cant believe i wasted my money on this movie.so i do n't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .
this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made.how can jon bon jovi play in a movie ? he is a singer not an actor , what ? is he killing vampires with his guitar ? and what about the dreadful plot ? o my god this movie really sucks . in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover ( blade ) surrounded by an army of vampires , but when the `` fantastic '' slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left ! ! what happened with the other 10-15 vampires ? they run out in the sun ? ? ? and what about the `` grand finally '' when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun ? ? ? that 's really a `` not '' . in `` buffy the vampire slayer '' in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun ? ? ? this really is a lack of originality !
unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old , celebrated english film . although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster ( which it is not ) , it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins . richard burton sleepwalks through his role , and sophia loren 's closed ( in this movie ) face does n't display much passion , either . ( * * )
while bondarchuk was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project , he was still a novice director with only a single pictures , a successful adaptation of a short wwii story , to his name . bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera , and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale . and it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes , often unfortunate camera positions , performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices , awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements . vidor 's `` war and peace '' was probably the main reason that prompted the soviet government to spare no expense on this production . the ussr release of the vidor 's picture made quite a splash . certainly , bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the hollywood film and find his own audrey . his final choice , lyudmila savelyeva , a big-eyed sprightly dark-haired thing indeed somewhat resembles hepburn . unfortunately she was a kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent , so unsurprisingly the most kind word that i can find to describe her performance is `` awful '' . though it might be expected that soviet actors , speaking the same language as tolstoy 's characters , would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this war and peace often proves that not to be the case . the revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of russian cultural soil , that the world of war and peace grown out of , so a good share of these big name soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as americans performing shakespeare ( i do n't mean of course that american actors ca n't possibly play shakespeare credibly , but you 'll know what i mean if you witnessed american members of the cast in branagh 's adaptations ) . of the three main characters only bondarchuk 's pierre is commendable , but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going .
horror/sci-fi that is interesting as it is laughable . f/x pretty good ... for what you manage to see . a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them . jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark . the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine . a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment . of course , after laughing and stammering in awe ... coombs ' creation , by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead , is let loose to hunt down one by one his father 's colleagues . revenge is not always rewarding . also in the cast : elsie muller , g.r . johnson , arthur roberts and velizar binev .
peter sellers plays dick scratcher ( ha , ha ) , a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one . although he 's witnessed a treasure being buried , he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank . thus , dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts ( do you place an ad for that ? ) and help lead a path to the treasure . it 's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film . former goon spike milligan replaced medak as director , and given medak 's talents in the film the ruling class , you can probably guess which of the grainy , poorly lit scenes had milligan in the director 's chair . peter boyle makes a brief appearance in the film 's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain . he 's probably quite thankful that young frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned , so that he can keep this off his resume . franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-scratcher but he and seller both look pretty desperate , with even sellers ' makeup and hair looking quite terrible . they had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it . with lines like these , i can understand any possible unease : pierre : ( about to be hanged ) you 'll pay for this . scratcher : no , i wo n't . i 'll do it for free . and that 's one of the good jokes . it 's amazing to me that much of sellers prolific material is still in the vaults , but this was made available on vhs more than 15 years ago ! how about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the us the well-received british tv program `` a show called fred '' starring sellers , milligan , and directed by the great richard lester ?
this movie was almost intolerable to sit through . i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits , but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me . i 've seen better acting in a 4th grade play . aside from that the plot is unrealistic . if the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in . i was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that . that is not a copycat the zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it was n't him . another thing that really bothered me was that they called disassociative identity disorder dsm 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder . overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore . plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget .
i 've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained . this movie is nothing . it 's so badly written , directed and acted that it barely makes an impression . the characters speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible . while that might make this campy and fun , it does n't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull . it 's as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either was n't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or did n't have the cojones . this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie .
nothing could have saved this movie , not even superman . ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing . better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors . but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it . plot holes , bad lines , terrible pacing , endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways ... ugh . avoid this one at all costs .
this is complete and absolute garbage , a fine example of what a bad movie is like , this ca n't be appealing to anyone , not even b-movie fans . do not , i repeat , do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash . bad acting , bad directing , horrible ( but i mean really horrible ) script , and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment ( of any form ) is . i bought the dvd for 3 dollars , i swear i could almost pay someone to take it . burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me . i like b-movies , the killer toys , the weird lagoon monsters , but this is nowhere near . you know those movies that are so bad they are funny ? not even . just plain old pathetic .
well then , what is it ? ! i found nicholson 's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting . angelica huston 's character drained my power . and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut . it 's not that i `` do n't get it '' . it 's not that i do n't think that some of the ideas could 've lead to something more . this is a film with nothing but the notion that we 're supposed to accept these ideas , and that 's what the movie has going for it . that nicholson falls for turner is absurd , but then again , it is intended to be so . this however does not strike me as a . ) funny , or b . ) ... even remotely interesting ! ! ! this was a waste of my time , so do n't let the hype get the best of you ... it is a waste of your time ! with all that being said , the opening church sequence is quite beautiful ...
well , i could nt get into the plot , but thats just me maybe . listless camera-movements at times , nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality.the acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies , which was nice . the climax is confused and disjointed , but still ... err riveting , thanx to stella stevens . the stunts are interesting , specially because of the 70 's las vegas backdrop . there are a few jerky hand-held camera-movements at the end , which keep me guessing , for a while . but i do n't think i ll b chasing the dvd , just yet .
it feels like swedish movies are trying to become more american and i just don´t get it . in this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special . don´t waste your time !
when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust imdb 's views on a film and , until this one , had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site i did not enjoy . sidney lumet , a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century , really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can : filling a film 's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever . i like films with flawed characters , but no matter how dark someone 's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too , we 're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others . mr. lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters . ethan hawke 's hank is a 30-something whining , immature , irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he 's a loser , which he very much is . his indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he 's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed . by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film , it 's more pathetic than uplifting . ethan hawke plays his character well , but is n't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he does n't ' particularly care that it 's there . speaking of which his character 's wife is equally as bad . just about every single shot of the film she 's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults . seriously , that 's just about all the character does . her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent . albert finney plays their father charles , and while mr. finney has been a great actor for many decades , he spends about 90 % of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he 's suffering from the world 's worst bout of constipation . for someone who 's been an actor as long as mr. finney , you think he 'd be more apt at emoting . even though he does n't show it much , his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled . and when he smothers andy at the film 's conclusion it 's akin to dr. frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it 's own misery . marisa tomei is n't given much to do with her character . stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason . when andy 's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship , but it really does n't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film , but probably the one with the most common sense at least . and finally we come to andy , played by the always good philip seymour hoffman , is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 . his performance of the heroin-addicted , embezzling financial executive who 's `` perfect crime '' of robbing his parent 's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing . his descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable , deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic . hoffman 's character ends up being the film 's chief villain , but it 's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who 's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son 's eventual psychosis and indirect , unintentional murder of his mother . ultimately this film is really only worth watching for psh 's great performance and it 's family train wreck nature . just do n't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for , because there really are n't .
many people here say that this show is for kids only . hm , when i was a kid ( approximately 7-9 years old ) i watched this show first . it was disgusting for me . i talked with other kids about this and , sure , other shows and know what ? this was the measure of disguise , whenever we wanted to emphasize something 's silliness ( either on tv or anything else ) we said `` uh , just like power rangers '' and laughed . and before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr . it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it . i did not enjoy that viewing . but it dawned upon me : maybe i have not enough imagination ? it may be . however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star .
i kinda liked the film despite it 's frenzied pace . but , i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north . it is definitely not montana north and never will be . americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world , and that is one reason why . stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet . such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world 's great nations . even in jest . i would never refer to the usa as 'alberta south ' . walt would never put us down , so why start now . other than that the film was pretty goofy , better luck next time .
i was n't sure whether to laugh or cry . porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw . costumes ? what costumes ? a t-shirt with strips of black leather on it . it was marion 's clothes -- or lack of them -- that really got me . do the 'fans ' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england . the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid , but the episode with an alien was worst of all . especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face -- an old trick.the hedgehog monster was pretty funny , as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows -- as if . the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over ' raw-bin hood and liddle john'.the second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan ...
everyone in this movie tells raffy carruthers how talented she is , what a great director she 'll one day turn out to be , etc . i think they 're just being nice . even kimble rendall , who directed this film , shows more talent than she does . `` the next jane campion '' , they call her ; and , even apart from the fact that they 're both over-rated , the two have so much in common . they both direct movies . they 're both women . they 're both australian . ( well , give or take . ) yep : it 's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant , and we just have to swallow hard and accept it . but i 'll say this for carruthers : she 's cute . -and fascinating . no , really . here are some thoughts on her lack of talent : ( 1 ) part of a director 's talent lies in dealing with people . why is carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her ? so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed , i expect . ( 2 ) why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen ? after all , it must have been filmed on a real movie set . how could they get it wrong ? if rendall 's set was half as much of an under-staffed shambles it 's a wonder he completed his film at all . ( 3 ) carruthers - the fictional director - has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick . fat chance . i doubt it can be done these days . i suspect that rendall - the actual , and more talented , director - set himself the same task , realised it could n't be done , and settled for ( sigh ) knowing parody instead . of course , it 's not enough of a parody to work as a parody . as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did ... well , less badly . ( 4 ) and yet , and yet ... the film opens with not a parody but an honest-to-goodness pastiche of 80s horror , starring ( this is too good to be true ) molly ringwald . this pastiche is much better than anything that follows . ( it 's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie-within-the-movie , rather than the movie . ) yet it , too , was filmed in the late 1990s . perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror . you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it . ( 5 ) i 'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents , but now i know . and strangely , i 'm glad i know . a need i never knew i had has been fulfilled .
even though the plot was very well detailed , and the story line was understandable the fact that steven seagals voice was dubbed with some one else 's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking . there were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else 's voice was doing the talking for him . i do n't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie i think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered . i have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film . when one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on dvd this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged . i have been a long time follower of steven seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years.to date i think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
okay , i struggled to set aside the fact that in selling evp as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get-go . i reasoned that hell , i do n't believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this . however , even with that accepted the movie is just not very good . it 's competently made and acted , but it does n't really capture you at all . there are several `` jump '' moments , and i just looked at them and thought `` yeah , i did n't expect that '' without actually jumping in the slightest . also the resolution does n't make sense . if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be , then why the hell does it need to use a proxy ? plus , the end caption was absurd . they obviously put it there as part of the `` give the movie credibility by claiming it 's all real '' thing , but for that to work it really needs to be at the start . but they ca n't put it at the start because then they give the plot away ... sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb .
this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen . i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel , and i wish i had n't . i turned it off after a little less than an hour , though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes . i wish i had . it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes ( which would be impossible ) i would in no way recommend this . its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century . i do n't think , as many people say that it is , that `` the bell jar '' is necessarily unfilmable , but this particular rendition could have been done without . i 'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .
i hate this programme : not only is the very concept ludicrous , but it tries so hard to be feasible ( something that was left out of similar `` i confess '' ending programmes like , muder : she wrote ) . sigh . why is it that the writers ca n't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court ? come on : after x-amount of years of the cases being unsolved , why must every suspect , every episode * confess * ( damn it ! ) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved ? i bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen : `` aw , shucks , officer , you 're a bright one - i guess if you 've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it , i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court . what can i say ? it 's a fair cop . '' absolute dog s * * t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of i.q .
as a huge fan of horror films , especially j-horror and also gore i thought nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good . i researched the plot , read reviews , and even looked at some photos to make sure it seemed like a good gory and scary movie to watch before downloading it . so excited it had finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror at the amazing gore i was expecting i was terribly disappointed . the plot was ridiculous and did n't even make sense and left too much unexplained , the gore was hilarious rather then horrifying , and what was with the cartoon style sound effects ? the acting was probably the only thing mildly scary about it . i did not understand the cactus idea and the way the mothers husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light , they left both pretty unexplained , or perhaps i missed it as my mind could n't understand what i was actually seeing . i appreciate the way it was supposed to be ; shocking and a few scenes ( the strange cannibalism and own mother kissing ? ) certainly were , i just think they went a little bit far and not even in a horrifying way , they made it to unconvincing which made it more believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion . however it is a very entertaining film and got a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends , but sadly we were expecting horror not comedy so its worth a watch for the entertainment value , but do n't be expecting a dark , deeply scary and horrifying film ; you 'll just be disappointed . if this was a horror comedy/spoof i 'd probably rate it about a nine , the climax being the weird scene when the husband climbed inside his wife 's stomach and closed up her wounds , but as a horror sadly i gave it a one .
1st watched 12/26/2008 - ( dir-eugene levy ) : corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs . the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers . but this one by charles shyer & nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts . the story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling americans , played by richard lewis and sean young , who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund 's return . upon trying to return it , they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady 's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money . they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder . the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story . the other cast members include character actors john candy , james belushi , cybill shepherd , george hamilton and others . after the police find out about the death , they start questioning the main characters and , of course , they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened . none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it 's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi/shepherd couple . this is n't a horrible movie , it just is n't that good . there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile . try it , maybe you 'll like it , probably you wo n't .
ok - the helicopter shots are fantastic , and the director made good use of some of barcelona 's top sights . otherwise ... production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week . ellen pompeo was charming and fun to watch , abel folk had the most depth and was very effective , and william baldwin was ... well , william baldwin . he got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running-jumping-earnest action figure . the rest of the cast was wooden at best , but mostly paper . so - if you 're nostalgic about spain - it 's a picture postcard with an action twist , and a healthy dose of el greco . if not , skip it .
it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end . why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes ! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best . also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it . if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since . the ending sucked but the rest was great
my ten-year old liked it . for me it was hard to get through it . christopher lloyd played it way over the top and the suit was tedious and unfunny . sorry to see jeff daniels in this .
it 's official , folks -- hou hsiao-hsien does n't have a thought in his pretty little head . are you wondering why he chose shu qi as his muse ? shu ( or is that qi ? ) does n't appear in this one . instead we get a snaggletoothed yo hitoto , apparently a pop star in japan -- judging by her song at the end , she 's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at rockin ' curry is `` a actriss '' -- and a wasted tadanobu asano , typically an indicator of quality , who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling asian hipster and is too old to manage even that . hou 's philosophy ? life is limbo , a big nothing , feel it and move on . i 'd like to do that but hou gives us nothing to feel in cafe lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of life in tokyo circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night , no , make that trains that pass in the day , never connecting , each hurtling to its own destination , usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they 're lucky . yikes . flowers of shanghai is one of the most rarefied , technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time . how could the same director who created the opening shot of that film , which features about twelve actors conversing at machine-gun speed for about ten straight minutes -- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub-jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now ? millennium mambo may be dead weight , but at least it has two great shots , shots that hint at hou 's true calling as the film equivalent of odilon redon : those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of shu qi floating down a blue corridor . his m.o . while making cafe lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from millennium mambo to make it more consistent . you be the judge if that sounds appealing . hou does not need to refine -- you can not refine the limbo idea further than flowers of shanghai . he needs to expand , to bloat outwards , to release the inner expressionist and genre-revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism . it 's time for him to do a live-action remake of akira or something . this kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long-shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe , ghettoized and stagnant as the hollywood action blockbuster . ( what is the connection between `` reality '' and people who ca n't talk ? it seems to me that people `` in real life '' never stop jabbering . ) then again , considering that 2005 alone brought big-budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as aeon flux , the island , and king kong , it 's now safe to say that even michael bay has surpassed hou , and that 's really sad . the good news is that , though hou is in his 50s , it frankly feels to me as if he has n't even begun . there are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there , such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset-red while hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins . but whatever fear is holding him back , however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema , hou , your time as the darling of the rotterdam , venice , toronto , berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double-quick . two words for you : atom egoyan . two more words , or maybe three : tsai ming-liang . you are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever . risk your shirt on a sci-fi epic , sell out , be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart . let your painterly talent express itself to the full . you 're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise .
i just could n't stop laughing ! ! this movie is incredibly funny and stupid ! but , never mind that , it is very entertaining ! in this film , you do n't need to pay attention to anything ! the acting is the same - lame ! the dinosaurs are the same - rubber ( oh , my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment . ) the raptors are the same from the carnosaur 2 , t-rex is also the same , but ... in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten . action is fast , sometimes too fast , actually i talk about fast editing , they edited it so fast , so that we can not see the rubber dinosaurs , but oopps ! to late , they are rubber ! well , only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this sequel . what can i say ... do n't rent it ... watch it on tv , with friends , it is much more entertaining !
first of all , i saw this movie when i was 7 years old at a christian scholl i attended . needless to say that i was scared out of mind . not because it was scary but because the content.cmon ... i was 7 . anyway , the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy . that 's very bad considering that i was only 7 and i remember that . the one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song `` i wish we all were ready '' where the chorus ends with `` ... you were left behind '' . i would n't suggest seeing this one . i probably will , just for nostalgic reason . besides , i 'm sure the remake is much better . the best part of this movie though , has to be when everyone `` dissapears '' ; vacant cars crashing , lawnmowers running on their own ... pretty hilarious .
irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie . she should have gone out with a bang , being the classy actress she was , not in this unmemorable , almost unknown film . this lightweight comedy is okay , but nothing special . the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half . maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit . even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here . rumor has it she was not happy with this film . one can see why . the story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom . speaking of that , i thought david nelson from the ozzie & harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna . he looked and sounded just like nelson . overall , so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress .
matt saunders ( luke wilson ) thinks he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson ( uma thurman ) , who seems like a quiet but pretty woman , though he soon learns that she 's needy and possessive , oh , and she 's also the superhero g-girl , though you would n't know it from the things she does to matt after he freaks out and breaks up with her . a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution . my super ex-girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience . what went wrong ? the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i did n't like the way they played it out . i was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film . however , they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho . it just was n't very fresh and after about forty minutes , the film wore out it 's welcome . sure , there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out . director ivan reitman has lost his touch . after a successful run in the eighties and early nineties , he started making crap like evolution and father 's day . i would n't say my super ex-girlfriend is a complete bust but i do n't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds , which is n't too much . don payne did an awful job with the screenplay . the majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one-note . he also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times . a few of the actors were good enough to save the film . uma thurman was great as g-girl and she had many funny lines . luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting . i do n't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he 's better in supporting roles like in the family stone . anna faris was just doing her `` scary movie '' routine and it 's getting a little old . she needs a challenge or at least some better scripts . wanda sykes is either hit or miss for me . she was great in monster-in-law and she was bad in clerks 2 . here , she is just annoying and does n't bring anything to the movie . eddie izzard was alright , nothing special . rainn wilson was just annoying and not funny . overall , i was disappointed with the movie . it was n't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average . rating 5/10
for a lot of time i was looking forward to see this movie , here in latinamerica japanese or any oriental movies have no distribution in theaters , we can find some of those movies in some underground stores , and i just found avalon , i was expecting something good , but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene , the rest of the movie is boring and senseless , just plain stupid , with a lot of useless scenes , and a boring story . i am wasting my time even writing about this film . sorry but is the truth .
having heard so much about the 1990s cracker series without seeing any of them , i looked forward to this eagerly . surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong . how wrong i was ! the polemics , backed by frequent , repetitive and violent flashbacks , were overpowering . the production tried to be super-modern , but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated . robbie coltrane sleep-walked through the two hours , coming up with unexplained and unlikely `` insights '' , and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots . as a result , the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene ( no details for fear of spoilers ) was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long time . no , i do n't want to see any more of these , but i will go back to the dvds of the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation .
this movie was just heckled by mst3k and with good reason . first and foremost because it is a `` cop '' movie starring joe don baker , who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western singer . all the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads , bar fights , children hostages in shoot outs , bad acting , lame police chiefs , bad acting , revenge/justice , endless goons , and of course , bad acting . do n't watch this without an mst3k filter folks .
look , i 'm reading and reading this comments and there 's a lot of it that i wan na say but i will try to make it short but clean ... first of all , lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made ... how it did n't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was `` hollywood '' , i mean , what did you expect a real life story ? when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and biggie ... its all covered up and buried deep down . second , i 'm not against neither 2pac or biggie i love them both but 2pac and lil kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure ... next , for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth , either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you do n't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies . use your mind and see though the clouds ... there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic , i did not say 60 % of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit , i mean a much better done . but anyways i 'm just some person giving her opinion .... no hard feelings ... look , i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live . with all do respect for 2pac and big , like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth .... bringing the wrong message to the children and that is : not going to school but living from the streets , hustling and just grabbing for the paper .... the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence , be smart and all . ok i know that many of you will think that i 'm crazy , but this is just my point of view . look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i 'm in hip hop for 17 , 18 years i still do n't know anything bout 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much i support them and listen to their music ... like most of you all out there . only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this . and for the end i just wan na say for all of ya biggie and tupac fans and family , this two men were and will be the greatest of all time , no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better , learn and love each other , think good even for the ones that do n't like you , because at the end ... its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top , its about accomplishing your self to the fullest and feeding your soul , your body and mind ... because if u manage to do that , you will be living a life even after death ! ! ! ! peace and love to ya all ! ! ! ! rip biggie,2pac , aaliyah , left eye , jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world ! ! ! !
fred olen ray is a lousy director , even as far as b movie directors go , but 'haunting fear ' is probably one of his better films . yes , it does butcher the great poe story 'premature burial ' and yes , it is badly paced and uneven throughout , but it is also pretty entertaining . scream queen brinke stevens is better than usual as a pretty , fragile housewife whose worthless husband ( jay richardson ) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster ( played by robert quarry ) . delia sheppard , a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies , actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress . you will also enjoy small roles played by karen black as a psychic , robert clarke as a doctor and michael berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes . the ending did n't make much sense !
i 've long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate ' films , many behind-the-camera types work on porno films . the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long . poorly paced , staged and written , it uses a lot of perfectly good talent ( diehl , dorn , eggert ) badly . much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere-popping host to the alien creature , but it never crosses the line ... you 'll still want to shower afterwards , though .
it 's here . finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy : health inspector . yet i 'm willing to bet the the wayan 's brothers ( hilarious ) will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time , outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of romeo and juliet . i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to . the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials . final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me . and the commercials looked so promising ...
this is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate . it looks as if it were shot on a back lot in california instead of where jack slade lived and died , idaho , colorado territories , and montana . it fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man , ' 'good man . ' the script is horrible ; there is very little direction , and lousy acting . dorothy malone is completely wasted as his wife . mark steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious jack slade . in real life , jack slade was a very good stage line superintendent . he was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking . when drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in virginia city , montana . to insure that he could never terrorize them again , vigilantes lynched jack slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately . this is a horrible movie . i can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how hollywood butches history at will , even to this day .
oh my god .. the worst sh * t i 've ever seen -this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie . and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth . though , maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable . i especially mean the role of h. graham . what was that ? ? ? in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers . the character was played in affected and annoying way . every time she appears it reminds that you ' re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment , then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion . terrible , do n't waste your time .
i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie . i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better . the acting , the music drowning out the actors . horrible . save your money ! you have to read the movie all the way through b\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines . i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered . what did that have to do with the `` real '' btk killer ? i understand why there were no famous actors\actresses in this movie . the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading . you would be better off watching paint dry .
holy freaking god all-freaking-mighty . this movie was so bad , i thought i was on drugs . in a bad way ... the character acting is the poorest thing i 've seen in quite some time . this movie was more akin to lord of the g-strings , imho ( it 's a real movie ) . most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen . my favorite part was when they are in the carriage , and you can tell there 's no horse . they 're fleeing from alien monsters , and going about the same speed as a swift jog . then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse . and the cg in general seems to be sub-par to 1992 's beyond the mind 's eye . i mean , come on , really . it felt like a horrible episode of hercules , only without kevin sorbo there to save the day . worst . movie . ever .
when i ordered this from blockbuster 's website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was . who knows ? maybe i 'd forgotten to take my add meds that day . i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon , donned in their late 70's-style wide collars , bell-bottoms and feathered hair , i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster . the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning , trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe , forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer . from the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the `` monsters '' from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'the vagina monologues ' . throughout the film , the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear . the `` ship '' was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path . of course if moved slower than bob barker 's impacted bowels , but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two ( with some assistance ) . moving on ... as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue ... we found out that they 're caught in a `` space time warp '' . how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information ? because the oldest male lead tells his son that , in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion , like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game ' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola . was pops a scientist ? nope , but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein 's theories . the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality . the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone , other than that , it was really , really , really bad . ( there 's not enough 'really 's ' to describe it , really ) . i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics . i never saw this film on its original release , but even back then i think i would 've come to the same conclusion : bury this one quick .
what 's happening to rgv ? he seems to repeat himself in every movie . has he run out of creative ideas ? if he has , time to take a back seat . went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did i imagine it would be anywhere near the original . i knew it would n't , the promos said it all . but even then i thought it would be a great rgv treat , after all is n't he the same guy who directed sathya and company ? or is he ? i have my doubts after watching aag . i am not going to talk about the plot or the story , as most of it is taken from the original , if you are really dying to go and see this one , you could play a fun game with friends : identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own ! so veeru becomes heero ( how corny is that ? ) , guess heeru would n't sound that great . ajay devgan is quite a disaster as heero , the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in company sounds fake . the chemistry between heero and gunghroo ( nisha kothari ) does n't exists at all . in fact the more charming nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes . this reaches a peak by the end . raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others , he is a guy to watch in the future . i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as babban , he looks like a caricature of gabbar singh . there is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl , instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl . the only performance that really stood out was mohan lal as inspector narasimha . i am afraid i do n't have the patience to write more .
i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey , no one wants to get typecast - but danny glover , brenda fricker ( happy birthday , brenda ! ) and christopher lloyd should have known better than this . `` angels in the outfield '' is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day . do i even need to tell you how it ends ? the movie is just plain lowly escapism ( examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s ) . if these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be ok ; this one is just pointless . far closer to diabolical than angelic . also starring tony danza , adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey , and i suspect that they do n't wish to stress this in their resumes .
what an utter disappointment ! the score of 6,1 here on imdb built up some mild expectations but , oh my , was i disappointed . the first thing that bugs me are those braindead , stereotyped university kids . yes , i know teens can be childish and so on , but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons ? there was one character that i thought was alright , but he/she ( not revealing it here ) was killed off way before the end . the other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero/heroine just did n't do it for me . on the plus side : the plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks . the acting was generally not very good , rutger hauer stands out in a small role . but it all fails with bland and braindead characters . you just stop caring about them after 10 minutes . 4/10 ( and thats being generous ) .
straight to the point : `` the groove tube '' is one of the most unfunny , unclever and downright horrible films ever made . this `` comedy '' is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it 's almost incomprehensible that it was even made . i said almost because there are fans of everything after all . this film is n't even `` good '' bad or `` enjoyable '' bad . to put this movie on the same level of entertainment as `` plan 9 '' or `` robot monster '' would be a crime to those films . films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of . but this film is so bad , so poorly made , acted and scripted and so incredible stale , that there just is n't even a trace of `` camp '' or `` schlock '' to be found . even though this was made before saturday night live premiered , comparisons were probably inevitable . i 'm not a big fan of snl , but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find . and man , that 's bad . just to keep the men viewers from leaving , shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often , but poorly-filmed breasts from 1974 are n't going to excite anyone these days . truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep-inducing excursion , i doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either . a man named ken shapiro made this film . i swear to god , any ten-year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever . it 's just downright unreal - this is truly an unbelievable film . the `` jokes '' and `` gags '' are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad 's porno mags out at night wo n't laugh . i will give this film one thing - the very last sequence , the `` dancing man '' sequence , where a guy ( shapiro ) on the streets of nyc dances to a tune , is easily the best thing in this horrible film . not that the `` dancing man '' sequence is that great either - it definitely has its moments of not being clever as shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song - but it actually was somewhat watchable . the part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film . no wonder shapiro put this sequence last - again , while not so great itself , it easily beats anything else in this `` film . '' otherwise , this film is such a complete piece of crap , it 's unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless . the name of this film should have been `` ken shapiro 's craparama . '' it 's amazing that this was made , but many truly talented filmmakers ca n't get in . however , i will say that i bet the geniuses at nyu would love this movie . total garbage .
everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! my grandma could have done better than that ! but that 's not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( it 's actually so bad that i 'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) if the first episode of les visiteurs ' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part , robin is trying to act like lemercier ( because she 's replacing her ) but that 's grotesque ' . lemercier is lemercier , robin is robin ! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she 's not acting as she used to act . i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played lemercier playing her role ' ! as for the story , it 's just too much ! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . the gags are repetitive , childish and déjà-vu . no , really , there 's no more than 3 funny parts in this . the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . so you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment ' ! 2/10
somehow they summed up the 60 's , ten years that radically changed our country , in four hours . and what a painful four hours it was . they trivilized the major events and happenings and they `` claimed '' it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family . if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash . what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways , but managed to attend every major 60 's event through the country . and the second family was such a non-factor . they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family . that poor son ... please nbc , do not make any movies about any other eras .... leave that to pbs and the history channel
on the surface the idea of omen 4 was good . it 's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl . in fact , sometimes , as in the exorcist , when girls are possessed or are devilry it 's very effective . but in omen 4 , it stunk . delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child , rather she is a child with issues . issues that maybe only a therapist , rather then a priest could help . she does not look scary or devilish . rather , she looks sulky and moody . this film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked . but it 's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies , as a made for tv movie special . on so many levels it lets down . it 's cheap looking , the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a tv drama . the characters do not bring any sympathy , and you do not route for them . i recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for christmas , and it has dated appalling . if your thinking of watching this , then i would suggest that you do n't . watch one of the others , or watch the exorcist , or watch the good son . just do n't waste your time on this drivel !
this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions . for all the people who want to see a great , exciting and cool horror movie should n't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work . a f- in my opinion . i have one question , what were they thinking ? let 's make a list : 1 ) bad script 2 ) bad script 3 ) bad script 4 ) bad acting 5 ) bad directing and last but not least a bad script . i mean i am not like grumping about every movie , but i was disappointed when i watched it . this movie should be banned into a box , locked and sunk down into the sea . so please do n't do something like this again , please , please , please ! ! ! !
the trouble with the book , `` memoirs of a geisha '' is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man 's way of thinking . reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music , sets , and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumesso far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters . the movie is n't about japan or real geisha . it is a story about a few american men 's mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions . so what is this movie if it is n't about japan or geisha ? is it pure fantasy as so many people have said ? yes , but then why make it into an american fantasy ? there were so many missed opportunities . imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang-ups , no connotations of sin about sex . sex is natural and normal . how is sex handled in this movie ? right . like it was dirty . the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch . does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie ? nope . one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she does n't want to get caught doing something dirty . such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha . did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off ? nope . she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block . of course she is n't supposed to enjoy it . and that is what i mean about this movie . why could n't they have given her something to enjoy ? why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong ? behind mameha the chairman was sayuri 's secret patron , and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity . he could have rigged the auction and won her himself . nobu did n't even bid . so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and , reeking of old-man stink , get his fingers all over her naked body ? would any woman ever really forgive a man for that ? let 's try to make sense of this . by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri 's geisha training . in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr. crab . through mameha the chairman sold sayuri 's sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her . the chairman was n't her patron . he was her pimp ! some romantic love story . yes , the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive , alluring transvestite whose voice , appearance and every touch are thrilling . but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret . under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart , soul , spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male . not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie , distortion , and terribly wrong . some contrasts between japan and moag : japanese style  refined , elegant simplicity . moag style  peking opera . japanese geisha  hair swept up . moag geisha  loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup . japanese shaved ice - japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances . shaved ice is strictly a summer treat . moag shaved ice - the chairman buys chiyo , the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo , this treat during cherry-blossom-viewing season . the thought made my entire body shiver with cold . japanese geisha  trained and skilled entertainers . moag geisha - sluts . japanese wind chime - used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes , thanks to the breeze , japanese people feel somehow cooler . moag wind chime - a door bell ! if a person stood in front of another 's house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic , not gain entrance . japan  emphasis on human relationships , group oriented . moag  `` i want a life that 's mine '' american individualism . japanese traditional dance  refined elegance . an almost geometrical and mechanical precision . moag dance  martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not-very-auspicious white japanese funeral shroud . performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club ? ha ha ha ! is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha ? japan house fire  setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community . fires can rip through those wooden villages , towns , and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people . moag house fire - great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out-of-control fire miraculously puts itself out . technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again . which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled . enough . the movie stinks .
well i 'll start with the good points . the movie was only 86 minutes long , and some of it was so bad it was funny . now for the low points . my first warning sign came with an actual `` warning '' on the film . when it started the following `` warning '' was displayed : `` the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images . because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun , pretty or romantic . '' i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then . the first words of the film were : `` i 'm at the glue factory . '' it was some guy talking on his phone , and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory . i do n't know why . so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him . the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find . the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script . that 's what is looked like they were doing . the script was horrible , and the big `` twist '' was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer . of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes . without any more painful details of the plot , here were some horrible highlights of the movie . they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an `` army of one '' because soldiers are really just murderers . then they tried to make an attempt at `` satanic worship '' by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting . the great `` computer hacker '' was able to get this kid 's address when someone gave him the kid 's name and phone number . for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address . i 'm not sure why he did n't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com . there was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason . i also learned that no matter where you get shot , blood will come out of your mouth within seconds . so if you like really bad acting , sub-par scripts , bad camera work and an obvious plot , you 'll love zodiac killer !
tourists head to ireland for a school trip to learn about druids . what they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers . if i had to sum up evil breed , it would be a low grade gore fest . the film mixes dead alive , evil dead , wrong turn all in one . it 's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any `` fun '' one would have watching it . the film has lots of random `` horror '' nudity ... although the film also stars four porn stars , yup four , so there could have been plenty more . breed also showcases a good amount of gore . evil breed has a horrible start , with laughable dialogue and horrible acting . that 's a given in a straight to video horror film , but this takes the cake . i ca n't really figure out who the main character is , since the one female who `` lives '' at the end is not really in the movie all that much . speaking of the ending , that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film . it has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one 's view of the film . you have to see this film to believe it , since there are some pretty great death scenes . there are two death scenes that come into my mind , one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest .... yea her chest , do n't ask me . the other id when the guy gets his intestines , yet again , ripped out through his asshole . does that kill the guy ? no , the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines . these scenes remind me so much of dead-alive , with the right amount of humour in each . i also got the sense of evil dead , with the pointless mentions of horror films and sam raimi . along with halloween , when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately ; y to get in . although , the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film . when the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs , her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots . distracting indeed . as well as the continuity in the film , with only one inbred killer ? as well as which character dies at which moment . i could n't tell if the breast implant chick was jenny or gary 's sister/cousin ... i ca n't remember . as well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body , still attached with the umbilical cord . the horrible editing is distracting as well , the opening credits are too fast and disorienting . it did have a bad start and got better , but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level . if maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film , then it would n't have been horribly butchered to death . stay away from this film , unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore .
suffice to say that - despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant `` abilities '' posted here - the director of this inept , odious tosh has n't made a film since . well that is excellent news as far as i 'm concerned . dead babies has all of the bile of its creator , but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist readable . when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch ? avoid like the plague .
yes , he is ! ... no , not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies . pintilie is the naked `` emperor '' - so to speak ... it 's big time for someone to state the truth . this impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man 's body . his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever . it is 100 % visual perversion : he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies . and if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard-on ! did you know that , on the set of `` niki ardelean '' , he used to embarrass poor coca bloss , by telling her : `` oh , coca , how i wan na f * * * you ! '' ? she is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction ! and , as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences , so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities `` works of art '' ! will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all ?
i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews . normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright . something told me to ... you know watch it first . i 'm glad i did . keira knightley ruined all future films for me with this role . in the 2nd pirates movie when it came out i went to see it . all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it . i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for domino . domino who ? who is domino harvey ? i still do n't really know or care . i do n't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film . i did n't care about her character and even keira getting partically naked did n't make it worth the movie . the direction was definitely lacking . the writing was trite and shallow . the editing was horrible . i do n't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it . there 's a place for it . good examples of choppy , mtv style , colorful editing ( not sure if there 's an official name ) would be fight club ; just off the top of my head . even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts . it was used tastefully and was n't used as a crutch . i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and crimson tide . tony scott please give me my time back . i understand there are many people who liked this movie . i guess the idea that you 'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment . frankly , i hate it .
... that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there . near dark covered the same territory but with much more class , and action . why the script kept their 'big secret ' so long was a total mystery to me - i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film . by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of 'big deal , tell me something i do n't know . ' i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions , unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror . this was woeful
1st watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 ( dir-ewald andre dupont ) : fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much-heralded event . the replication of the disaster is not bad , but the drama around it is at some times silly , badly acted and way-too soap opera-like . the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar-winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late . good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against ( barely ) in his recreation .
elephants dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community . and while it was a very interesting idea in concept , in reality it has failed miserably . the film is beautifully rendered , which is probably the only redeeming factor . a huge problem with them , however , is the vast overruse of light bloom . it 's horrible , although i guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality . one thing to note is the terrible voice acting . while proog 's voice actor is at least semi-competent , emo 's voice actor is horrible . i guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero , you ca n't afford to hire real voice actors . to me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice . as a whole , the movie does n't really go anywhere . to me it seems like it 's more of a `` look what we can do '' kind of movie instead of a real film . the plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point . the whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas . overall , it may be worth a quick download from the official site , but do n't expect anything except pretty graphics .
raising victor vargas : a review you know , raising victor vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , steaming bowl of oatmeal . it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey raising victor vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . victor vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director 's part . apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a latino family on the lower east side , and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof . he was right , but it did n't fool me . raising victor vargas is the story about a seventeen-year old boy called , you guessed it , victor vargas ( victor rasuk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the rolling stones could do in all the years they 've toured . the movie starts off in ` ugly fat ' donna 's bedroom where victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best-friend harold ( kevin rivera ) comes-a-looking for him . caught in the attempt by harold and his sister , victor vargas runs off for damage control . yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood , nothing dissuades young victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . on a hot , new york city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph judy ( judy marte ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . the relationship that develops between victor and judy becomes the focus of the film . the story also focuses on victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita ( altagracia guzman ) , his brother nino ( also played by real life brother to victor , silvestre rasuk ) and his sister vicky ( krystal rodriguez ) . the action follows victor between scenes with judy and scenes with his family . victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp-daddy , his feelings for judy and his grandmother 's conservative catholic upbringing . the problems that arise from raising victor vargas are a few , but glaring errors . throughout the film you get to know certain characters like vicky , nino , grandma , judy and even judy 's best friend melonie . the problem is , we know nothing of victor vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and comb his fro , and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack , but that 's all . we know that nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . we know his sister nicki , is a gossip-loving girl with an invested interest in watching tv . we know that grandma is a hard-working traditional latina woman who 's trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption . yet where is the titular character , victor vargas ? he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . victor vargas is n't so much a character but a ping-pong ball , bouncing between scenes with judy and his grandmother , but we never get to know who victor vargas really is . this is important because as i 've mentioned the only thing we know of victor vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of manhattan . he 's a total alpha-male . victor vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . why should anyone ? so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow victor vargas has attained any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? how could such a two-dimensional character have any depth ? if only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand-held shot . raising victor vargas brings to life the world of the latino inner-city neighborhood to the big screen . something that few films have done before in the past . the film has been complimented for feeling so real , and i wo n't argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since cbs aired survivor . seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer/director peter sollett was way too dependent on close-ups and hand-held shots . this problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep-breathing exercises to keep from passing out . as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen ; you can practically smell victor vargas 's cheap cologne . the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . the indoor scenes of inner-city apartments make them look small and cramp , which is not true . i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . they 're not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they 're decent living spaces . by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brick-and-mortar , chipped paint and cracked walls . unfortunately , sollett 's constant use of close-ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom-in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . but raising victor vargas is only sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . one review i read summarized the movie as , ` ethnicity for ethnicity 's sake , ' and i can not agree more . if victor vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' applicability would n't matter whether they were latino , chinese , etc . yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle-class suburbia with a bunch of teeny-bopper white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . indeed , some other aspects of the use of latinos in this film bother me . while some aspects of victor vargas are accurate others i have to question . for example , victor , nino and vicky all share the same room to sleep . this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . any self-respecting latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen-year old girl . at first i was unsure , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that vicky would have been sleeping in her room . as a latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full-time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because i really wanted to love this movie . unfortunately , my lack of respect for victor vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film . maybe it 's because victor vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my sega genesis when i was seventeen . maybe it 's because without any further introspection by the film , victor vargas is merely a stereotypical hot-blooded latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay-bee , ju want to get into my luv mah-cheen ? ' either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? so if you 'll excuse me , i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits .
i have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie . i guess i must have missed something . the beginning is intriguing , the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories . that 's the best part . after the three go their separate ways , the film splits into three threads . that 's when boredom sets in . certainly , the thread with the felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity . unfortunately , the director beat this one to death , even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular . bottom line : a two-hour plot-thin listlessness . if you suffer from insomnia , view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep .
i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival . i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film . and crispin glover 's film is outrageous . he basically exploits the mentally challenged . not only is shirly temple the anti-christ ( which i admit is a little funny ) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other , but there is an obsession with killing snails . crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are , mentally challenged . peta and human rights should be all over this thing . it 's not 'counter-culture ' as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival , it 's exploitation .
my husband and i bought the old school sesame street dvd 's for our daughter and i have to say , i do n't let her watch the new episodes on tv , because i find all of the characters annoying . baby bear and telly ? omgosh , how annoying and useless blabber can someone think of for their 'skits ' ? elmo ? give it a rest not every kid likes him , once again , annoying and does n't teach my child anything . mr. noodle ? what a reject . i think the one time i turned the 'new ' show on for her , she and i were left dumber than before . the show has definitely taken a wrong turn . i remember the yip yips , kermit 's breaking news , 1-2 2 little dolls , mumford the magician , bert and ernie , grover the waiter , all the great educational skits of old school s.s. sesame street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and dumbness since jim henson 's passing in 1990 . the show no longer has the educational , funny and interactive skits it used to . i find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber . way to go s.s. producers/writers you have yet another cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative , non-exercised kids in front of so they 'll get out of their hair . per producers/writers : i suggest you whip out the old muppets and start taping similar content to that of the first sesame street 's . lord knows i sure do n't want my child talking like baby bear or elmo .
this is simply the worst movie i 've ever seen . neither of the three central characters has any charm , and erika 's good looks are n't enough to carry the film . the lamest plot i 've ever had inflicted upon me . also the most unconvincing military comedy ever . why did they bother ?
loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the ( 1 ) it deserved . ( for that matter , loyalty to mr. falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails . ) even if you forgive all the glaring errors , this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made-for-tv `` columbo '' film ever . i 'm glad i watched it on tv for free ; would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print .
this is just plain bad . sometimes remakes , even if they stray from the original , are good on their own . they can bring another viewpoint and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable . this was as poorly thought out and carried out as can be . this was n't any good even standing on it 's own . viggo mortenson is a top-notch actor , but some of his selections of roles and projects leaves something to be desired . the original `` vanishing point '' was such a thrilling , psychological adventure ; this is not an adventure at all , and is not enjoyable or entertaining whatsoever . this was made from a by-the-numbers approach to film-making , stuffing in plot points that someone in hollywood believes will please what they see as today 's film-going audience . basically , they see us as a bunch of idiots . it 's insulting that someone will put this out as a feature film , and even attempt to remake a cult classic this sloppily . the manipulative plot devices , the `` make-it-obvious-so-they-don't-miss-the-point '' aspects , ridiculous dialogue , stereotyped characters , amateurish direction ... this is plain bad ....
i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film . i found it incredibly silly ( at best ) and downright misleading , misinforming and harmful ( at worst ) . like others , i found this film to be an awful mix of `` real '' science and pseudoscientific , new age propaganda . as a psychologist , i was especially offended by candace pert 's contributions . true , i was not a fan of hers before this film , but her discourse on the `` consciousness '' of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term ( `` consciousness '' ) that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify . it is an old orwellian mind-f * * k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay `` politics and the english language . '' to refer to `` consciousness '' in this manner -- indeed , to refer to this film as `` based in science '' in general ( which is its clear intent ) -- is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave-states `` democratic republics '' and hitler when he called his party a `` socialist workers '' movement . i do n't claim to really understand quantum physics . i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study . ah , but we americans do love `` instant enlightenment , '' and that 's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish . if it asked questions , that would be one thing , but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them , which no film could possibly do simply because we are far , far away from the answers ( if they indeed exist ) . by the way , ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several `` expert commentators '' with the maharishi mahesh yogi ( and tm ) , not to mention j.z . knight , who often speaks in her `` ramtha '' voice . ( i 'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old atlantean superman 's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology . but then again , this film argues that the past , present and future are all one and the same , so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10,000 years ago , i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow . only , then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers ? oh , i forgot , i 'm the creator of `` good '' and `` bad '' advice , so it 's all my fault , not ramtha 's . ) what a mess .
i feel the movie did not portray smith historically . the goal of this movie was to tell smith 's life in a way that would be `` comfortable '' to the lds church leaders , historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern . the movie was designed to be a `` faith promoting '' experience , not a balanced view of smith `` as a man . '' i have taken it upon myself to study smith 's life and have read both lds works and none lds works . the movie , like most lds projects , was beautifully filmed and well acted . however , this was not a realistic portrayal of either the beginnings of mormonism or smith 's relatively short life . a significant period of time was given to reenacting an accident that smith had when he was seven . while this event was no doubt important in forming his mental outlook , it appears that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a sympathetic view of joseph smith . another point is in portraying smith 's teen years the film is silent regarding the smith family 's involvement in magical practices during the 1820 's . another problem is while the movie shows joseph smith good-naturedly entering into wrestling contests , it fails to show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent . i could go on and on . this movie was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional movie about a man . i would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose other then entertainment .
i 'm not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time . i would like to say , however , that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous . johnnymacbest , you ca n't play that card , and i mean the nationalism patriotic card , to make people not watch this movie . this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country ( oh yea i played that card ) even though the director is german and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera , but the world is full of controversy , and its the same thing you 've heard before , like the gta controversy . it 's a comedy , laugh and be disgusted , not disgusted all together , its dark humor and obviously you do n't have the heart to take it , the past is past , yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on , that was ! ! ! 7 ! ! ! years ago . you can still watch this movie and have good moral values . besides i 'm insane , and who needs a soul ?
to say that thunderbirds is a horrid , forced , in-your-face , ugly looking , nasty to listen to and painful to watch film would n't be saying enough . there are only two reasons i can think of why you 'd watch this film : 1 ; you 've seen thunderbirds when you were young ( like i did ) and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up . or , 2 ; you 're seeing it with someone under ten years old . thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts . the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle , humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it . from the off , thunderbirds is wrong , wrong , wrong . the whole moral message and 'goal ' is set up in an excruciating way : jeff tracy ( a new low for bill paxton ) tells his youngest son alan he 's not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island 's bowels to fire up thunderbird one . the whole film is then a series of events and miss-fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five . the film relies on kid actors to carry the film : a 16 year old alan tracy ( corbet ) , a 16 year old tin tin ( hudgens ) and a 14 year old fermat ( fulton ) who is brains ' son . to say that watching the 'adventures ' they get up to is painful is an understatement . frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil 'hood ' ( kingsley ) in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film ; it only differs when everyone 's in a different location . also , the whole 'mind control ' thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood  forced and incidental . i know that most 'film 's for kids ' these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it 's done in a way that fetishises lady penelope . sophia myles plays penelope and i think it 's no coincidence she 's a little older than the rest of the kids  at 24 years old , it 's almost too good to be true . her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push . we see her in the bath , bubbles up to her neck watching tv ; in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet , bare and bubble covered foot . frequent shots of her massive , bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes : this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman ! twinned with this , her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh , dominant , english accent ; sounding like a commanding mistress ( well , she is lady penelope after all  and you 'd better make sure call her that ) the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids wo n't notice but it sure as hell is there . the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre , the characters that are his bodyguards : a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot . are we supposed to be laughing at this ? what about the fight scenes ? poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises ? it 's utterly , utterly laughable . the list goes on . the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously , like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another , the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place . news bulletin : sponsored by ford , the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot , the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip  it 's infuriating . the fact we are told to believe that a 16 year old girl can swim in the freezing thames , against the current , rescue a downed monorail ( monorail over the thames ! ? ) , get back to the hatch and thus ; save the day all the time holding her breath . it is absolute bull and the makers know it  i do n't even know if a 10 year old would swallow it . in short : avoid , avoid , avoid . thunderbirds is infuriating , unfunny , poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car  everything that could go wrong , did go wrong .
i notice that the previous reviewer ( who appears to be still at school ) gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer has n't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel . the major problem i had with this ( 1999 ) version was the casting of anthony way as tom long . anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini-series `` the choir '' . i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in `` the choir '' . unfortunately the small boy who appeared in `` the choir '' had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time `` tom 's midnight garden '' was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom . it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom ( as played by anthony ) would befriend the far younger hatty . in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects . the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5.00 , need i say more ?
the sight of kareena kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega-disappointing , mind-numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend . bad films are bad films and we see some every week , but tashan is not just a bad film , it 's a terrible film . terrible because it takes its audience for granted , terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they 've got big movie stars onboard.written and directed by vijay krishna acharya , tashan is what you 'd describe as a road movie , but one that 's going in all the wrong directions . saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff , a call-centre executive who 's hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji - that 's anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster , desperate to go cool . jimmy 's got his eye on pooja , the gangster 's pretty young assistant ( played by kareena kapoor ) , who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees . determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja , bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job . so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey , the gangster 's faithful aide from kanpur , who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that 's hidden across the length and breadth of the country.much like those bad eighties potboilers , tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot . but the treatment 's so over-the-top , so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect . instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three-act structure , you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed . that garish item song in the desert , the bullet-dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort , kareeena 's bikini moment , even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks , a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala , and believe it or not , even a dhanno-style horse-driven tonga . in all fairness , not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture , because you 're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really . little do you expect in a seemingly fast-paced road movie , to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts.you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making . what 's more , i do n't think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance . arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work , tashan is like an overcooked stew.there are films that kill you softly , and then there 's tashan , a film that kills you with excess . packaged snazzily with glossy-finish camera-work , exotic locations and fancy costumes , every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together , but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story does n't hold . borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow does n't help either because they do n't blend with the film 's wafer-thin plot . one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging , but anil kapoor 's grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists , and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly , unable to find his feet . kareena kapoor , meanwhile , queen of over-the-top delivery , does a decent job . but of course , if tashan is salvaged to some extent , it 's thanks to akshay kumar 's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character . you cringe when he 's cupping his crotch repeatedly , and you scowl when he delivers those double-meaning dialogues , but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he 's up there.despite some good music from vishal-shekhar , the songs seem like they 're only prolonging your misery . well that 's because tashan is a test of your patience . in case you did n't know , tashan means style . i 'm sorry to say , this film has none .
a painfully protracted , maudlin and predictable drama , my twenty-fifth sidney lumet film , garbo talks , gets filed precipitously on the low quality end of my quest . the film documents a harried young working man named gilbert ( ron silver ) , who is son to estelle rolle ( anne bancroft ) , eccentric , feisty and above all , an obsessive fan of greta garbo . when estelle becomes afflicted with a brain tumor , her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own : track down greta garbo , and bring her to his mother . anne bancroft is in full-on , chew-the-scenery auntie-mame mode here , that kind of feisty ol ' gal that film loves , where she mouths off to people , and stands up for her ideals , and ends up in jail all the time . she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial construct , and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame ; every note striking false . the rest of the characters are equally as one-dimensional , but tremendously less-interesting . ron silver is flat as can be , and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphed as anything else in the film : he is dating affluent lisa rolfe ( carrie fisher ) , but becomes smitten with oddball co-worker jane mortimer ( catherine hicks ) , and i called every scene three scenes before they happen . that 's the other problem . one-dimensional characters can survive if they are posited in an intriguing and captivating story , but there 's simply nothing here . the film 's pace is glacial , resplendent with extraneous material that strengthens absolutely nothing , and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot , it 's both plodding and uninteresting . there are plenty of guest stars , so to speak , including harvey fierstein as a gay new yorker ( imagine that ) in yet another highly inessential scene . late in the film , it attempts to make a halfway-decent statement on the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives , but by that time , none of the characters exist as real people , and the film had bored me into submission , so it functions as a case of far-too-little , far-too-late . the film is my twenty-fifth lumet-directed film , making him easily my most-viewed director , but outside of a couple egregious misses ( a stranger among us , anyone ? ) , he has n't plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks . { grade : 4.5/10 ( c/c- ) / # 21 ( of 24 ) of 1984 / # 23 of 25 lumet films }
i rented the dubbed-english version of lensman , hoping that since it came from well-known novels it would have some substance . while there were hints of substance in the movie , it mostly did n't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon . maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book , or it lost a lot in the dubbed version . or maybe even the source novels were lightweight . but for whatever reason , there was n't much there . i noticed lots of details that were derivative , sloppy , poorly dramatized , or otherwise deficient . some examples : the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 `` star gate '' scene and the star wars image of hyperspace . the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized `` r2-d2 '' . it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars , but mercifully ( since the humor does n't work ) gives up on comedy and plays it serious . in that sense , it 's superior to the star wars franchise , which started with a clever sense of humor , and eventually deteriorated to jar-jar 's annoying silliness . the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm . the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field , dumping silage onto unharvested crops , rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already-harvested rows or into a truck . corn ( maize ) was pouring out the grain chute , but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field . when it was time for kim 's father had to face his fate , there was n't any dramatic weight to the scene . that could have been partly the fault of the english-language voice actor , but the drawings did n't show much weight either . kim 's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing . similarly , when a character named henderson was killed , chris showed very little reaction , even though they were apparently supposed to have been close . ( henderson 's death is no spoiler ; his name is n't revealed until his death scene . ) she seems to promptly forget him . someone 's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does . i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case ; there 's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris . on several occasions , villains fail to accomplish their orders . a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths . i ca n't say whether that 's lifted from star wars , or if that comes from an earlier source -- possibly the lensman books . there 's a scene where a space ship crash-lands . as it plunges toward the ground , parts are break off the ship . but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands . while in most cases chris seems like a competent , tough space hero , there 's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress . someone tough enough to get over henderson 's death so quickly should at least be able to shout , `` help , it 's got me and i ca n't reach my gun ! '' instead of just shrieking . the character with the most personality ( almost too much at times ) is d.j . bill . he sounded like wolfman jack , the d.j . in american graffiti . i wonder if he 's as well-voiced in the original language . two planets in the movie exploded . the explosions were unimpressive , and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars . to its credit , however , the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star 's primary weapon . the dialog had a good , interesting explanation for the cause . many other explosions in the movie did look good , just not the planetary explosions . some of the sound effects are very cheesy , as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game . some of the images look like primitive video games , and some influence from tron is visible too . on the other hand , the sound effects are often pretty decent , although that emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts . the art is good too , particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics . finally , there 's the story . if a movie tells a good story , it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings . but the plot here was pretty lightweight . a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship , and acquires a great power he does n't understand . he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful , unredeemably evil enemy . he makes friends , learns about his special power , and grows into a young man . if he is persistent and virtuous enough , he might even defeat the evil enemy . details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline , but there 's very little more than that in this movie . in the end , it 's just a kiddie cartoon . but then , since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children , maybe it does n't need to be anything more than that .
102 dalmatians [ walt disney ] : i was n't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first , a silly padded storyline , terrible over acting by glenn close , who hams up every scene as though she 's playing for her own amusement , and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors . once more the dogs are the only `` actors '' that seem `` real '' and thats a stretch . another wasted effort here . grade : d
race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you 've driven 150 , and 150 mph seems fast till you 've driven 250 . ok. andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen eraserhead , and eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen begotten . and begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen the works of c. frederic hobbs . race fans , there is nothing in all the world of film like the works of c. frederic hobbs . alabama 's ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot , and it only involves hippies , rock concerts , voodoo , ghosts , vampires , robots , magicians , corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and mystery gas . and the fabulous woodmobile , cruising the sunset district in san francisco , of course . what 's really startling is that somebody gave him a lot of money to make alabama 's ghost . there 's sets , lighting , hundreds of extras , costumes , lots and lots of effects . somehow that makes alabama 's ghost so wrong . you watch some awful cheeseball like night of horror or plutonium baby , and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their discover cards . but alabama 's ghost was made with an actual budget , and that 's evil . i mean , i 've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in thunder bay , ontario , building a secret temple in the woods out of twizzlers , and nobody 's beating down my door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for four of the flakiest movies ever made ?
let me give a quick summery of the film : a rotten , rude kid named max stumbles upon a radio that contains kazaam : a rapping genie . like all genies , he grants 3 wishes but , being good natured , also helps max with his personal life , as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime . during all this , kazaam raps from time to time , ( also showcasing shaq 's dismal rap skills ) . this movie proves what we all know : athletes need to stick to sports . i admit that it never looked like an oscar-worthy movie , but everything about this waste of film is horrible . the characters are either unlikable or stupid , the plot is not even worth mentioning , the dialog is a joke , and shaq is only a quarter of the problem . hell , even if denzel washington played kazaam this movie would still be a joke . i know that the movie only drew anybody was because shaq was so big ( no pun intended ) at the time . i honestly can not think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time . shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws .
were i not with friends , and so cheap , i would have walked out . it failed miserably as satire and did n't even have the redemption of camp .
i 'm a big fan of the true crime genre , but i could n't sit through this putrid piece . it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica , down to the porn-flic soundtrack . there was no look at what made dahmer tick , no exploration of who his victims were . nothing but `` look at how creepy this guy is . '' and i have to give the filmmakers this much -- their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen .
now , i wo n't deny that when i purchased this off ebay , i had high expectations . this was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy . however , i was soon to be disappointed . apologies to those who enjoyed it , but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch . i got a few smiles , sure , but the majority of the funny came from the music videos ( which i 've got on dvd ) and the rest was basically filler . you could tell that this was not al 's greatest video achievement ( that honor goes to uhf ) . honestly , i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd , so if you 're an ultra-hardcore al fan and just have to own everything , buy the tape off ebay . just do n't pay too much for it .
spend your time any other way , even housework is better than this movie . the jokes are n't funny , the fun rhymes that are dr. seus are n't there . a very lousy way to waste an evening . my kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net . my wife left and did dishes . so i finished it alone . it was the worst `` kids '' movie i have seen . if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 , that movie is fun for kids and their parents . avoid this movie . it is n't funny , is n't cute , the cat 's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label .
there 's a lot of movies that have set release dates , only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal snafu of some kind , and then put in limbo for a long time . you can only wish a film as rotten as `` slackers '' remained in a coma for what it 's worth , which is miniscule . release dates were continually shifted around for this truly awful movie that is so much a bleep on the radar like it deserves . the premise kicks off under the guise of ethan , a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus bombshell angela . ethan devilishly enlists the aid of david and his friends who have been scamming the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela . i do n't like to give spoilers out , but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception . angela falls for david , ethan intentionally screws everything up , the good guys win . that 's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre . gross humor is funny , it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic `` animal house '' , to the likes of contemporaries like `` there 's something about mary '' and `` road trip '' amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention . but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far , case in point , ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual strands of hair of which he does god knows what with it . no one wants to take witness to watch ethan urinating in the shower while singing to himself . no one wants to watch a young man singing `` she 'll be coming around the mountain '' with a sock on his penis . but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50 's bombshell mamie van doren bare her breasts at 71 years old . i do n't know if it 's the story 's lack of coherence , which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense . director dewey nicks was a former fashion photographer , and after reviewing this film , you can only wish he 'll go back to the profession . the worst thing you can do on any film , is to make it look like you 're having fun , because you detract from your objectives , just like `` slackers '' does , by burying it 's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags , pointless vignettes , and lack of construction . it 's like a bunch of college students got drunk , took one 's camcorder , and shot a bunch of random crap and compiled it together . if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that 's actually good , then i suggest `` american pie '' and `` animal house '' , or `` road trip '' , just something that 's entertaining , and not dreadfully bad like `` slackers '' . coincidentally cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film , just as she did in another bad film such as `` the sweetest thing '' where the story treats gross humor like another plot , instead of a device much like this disaster .. if you pass by `` slackers '' at your local video store , just keep on walking , and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves .
i watched this hoping to find out something i didn ` t know about modern history ` s most infamous man and couldn ` t help thinking that history has been rewritten in hitler : the rise of evil . hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer ` s shot . hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm . forgive me for asking but haven ` t the writers confused adolph hitler with tony montana from scarface ? that ` s bad enough but what really offended me was that there ` s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made germany pay a heavy price for doing so . it was this economic environment that led the german people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that ` s why they turned to nazism . the german humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that hitler : the rise of evil can be taken seriously as a historical document , and i haven ` t even mentioned that himmler and goering are conspicous by their absence there is one positive point about the mini series and that ` s robert carlyle in the title role . okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( archive recordings show that hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate hitler ` s own charisma on screen . comments in the british press that carlyle resembles the synth player from sparks more than adolph hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of hitler . i liked the performance by robert carlyle but i hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . there ` s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had , if you can imagine that . there is no decipherable plot or story , the special effects are a joke , and even the sound is terrible . this film was directed by henry sala . it was the only film that he ever directed , and the reason is obvious .
black candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us `` vampyres '' and much later , `` rest in pieces '' , among others .. i 'm only noting the ones i 've seen . at any rate , we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it , and the man keels over . not sure if it was good for either of them , at that point . fast forward to where the man 's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will , or something to that effect , and of course everybody else except her is in on something , which happens to be devil worship . it 's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times . to spice things up though , there 's a simulated bestiality scene ( i hope it 's simulated ) with a black goat , sure to be a crowd pleaser . ugh . at times this echoes `` rosemary 's baby '' , minus the baby , because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty satanic herbs these are too , because that keeps getting remarked upon . however , the herbs are n't the only thing that reeks about this film . the end seems to be back to the beginning again , and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they 've been during the middle part . it 's not unwatchable , it 's just not very good , and i guess it all depends on what you like to see in films , and there was n't much here that did anything much for me . 3 out of 10 .
* * 1/2 for this diane keaton farce . someone should tell ms. keaton , enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats . this flick is just too much as keaton 's daughter , sara , dies in a traffic accident , while her boyfriend survives . keaton , who could not be reached by phone at first , as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug , grieves in a new way for grievers . she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara 's friends are staying . she cleans the house , sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed . it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter . in addition , she had an abortion thanks to this guy . we 're all now put on this guilt trip . her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept . she also hopes that boyfriend , adam , who is a playwright , will not include all this in another play . when the diary is found , it has been written in japanese . sara had a ph.d in this language . it 's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant . naturally , everything seems to tie up nicely in the end . the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz . every time mom and sara would speak , they would both utter surrender dorothy . as if this is n't enough , during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning , keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film , interiors , where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman . ms. keaton also tries drugs with the group . come on , folks , can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this ? fair to mediocre best sums up this film .
for the knowledgeable beatles fan , the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws , inaccuracies , combined events , omitted events , wildly exaggerated events , omitted people , timeline errors , mis-attribute quotes , incorrect clothing , out of place songs , and ( shame shame ) incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now . the flaws come fast and furious so you 'll have to be on your toes . i did n't give this a `` 1 '' primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors ( the band rain ) give it their all ( the lennon character is credible and does a good job ) . also , the song `` cry for a shadow '' is heard at one point and that counts for something . so , , , watch it for fun , but please do n't take it as historically accurate .
this film came recommended as a good action film , which i do n't really think it is . i found the story convoluted and not all that easy to follow . there really is n't that much action until the end of the film and it 's pretty dark and hard to see what 's really happening . i was sure hoping for something different , but , alas , did n't find it here .
utter dreck . i got to the 16 minute/27 second point , and gave up . i 'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible ( although 'pissible ' is a more fitting word ... ) . unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between macmurray and stanwyck in the original , the chemistry between dumb ol ' dicky crenna and whats-her-face here is just non-existent . the anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet ? there 's no ciggy-lighting-by-fingertip ? and i thought i 'd be sick when they have a mortified-looking ( and rightly so , believe you me ) lee j. cobb as keyes practically burping/upchucking his way through the explanation of his `` little man '' to mr. garloupis . no offence to the non-sighted , but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the dietrichson and neff houses . the same goes for those horrid plaid pants that phyllis wears . and crikey , how much $ $ does neff make , that he lives overlooking a huge marina ? this , folks , again , all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes . if you can get through more of it , you have a much stronger constitution than me , or you are a masochist . but please , take some alka-seltzer first , or you will develop a `` little man '' of your own that may never go away . proceed with caution , obviously .
carl panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him . the book `` panzram : a journal of murder '' by thomas e. gaddis and james o . long , which came out the better part of a century after panzram 's death , gives the historical context to a first-generation american 's account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy , getting caught , thrown in the boy 's home , getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized . as panzram grew huge and strong , he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to south america , europe and africa , and it did n't matter what people he raped , robbed , or murdered because we are all equally worthless . this film casts skinny james woods as the rough neck , mean-ass , son of a bitch carl panzram who in the film is a `` drunk '' , overly-dramatic and emotional , and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys . the film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner ( like robbing former president taft or being released from the oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return ) . in short , i do n't think carl would be too happy .
naturally i did n't watch 'gi jane ' out of choice . i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex-girlfriends house . gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario , which of course it is n't . the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints , restricting the amount of humour ( of which there is none ) or entertaining action scenes , and soon becomes too serious . the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable . 'gi jane ' fails where other action films succeed , mainly because films such as james bond , dirty harry and various others are larger than life , yet never proclaim to be otherwise . they are escapism , and therefore entertaining . 'gi jane ' tries to be real and fails . this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott , with a very non-credible storyline , unremarkable acting , and the only reason i give it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the technical work .
it kept my attention to the end , however , without spoiling the film for anyone ....... when she fixed the fridge by getting a book from the library , you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self defence against and assassin . the film , for me , said nothing of worth .... is becoming an assassin really a remedy for mental illness or just another symptom .
i have to agree with most everyone 's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.the acting was not much more above the lower production values however i feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it . in keeping with this thought i feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.i am referring to laura harris a canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the hbo hit `` dead like me '' where she plays the role of daisy adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.i remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.i felt as though if anyone might `` make it '' from this series it surely would be laura harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique nordic blond allure . if you ever do have the opportunity to view this series i recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'godfather ' or perhaps 'beaches ' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what laura harris can simply state about her time on the show and i bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying `` it 's a start ! ''
it really impresses me that it got made . the director/writer/actor must be really charismatic in reality . i can think of no other way itd pass script stage . what i want you to consider is this ... while watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors . it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there , not enjoying it , just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying . id really like to know what the budget is , guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor . i want to write 'the jokes did n't appeal to me ' . but the reality is for them to appeal to you , you 'd have to be the man who wrote them . or a retard . so imagine that in script form ... and this guy got that green lit . thats impressive is n't it ?
i am appalled at how bad this film is . as a pastiche of early 20th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past the moderns or ( gasp ) cradle will rock & i never thought i 'd see a film worse than those 2 . granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period . nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar . first off there 's the horrible casting : eddie izzard as chaplin ? excuse me ? peter , did you owe this guy something ? jennifer tilly as loulla parsons ? ? kirsten dunst as marion davies ? ? ? holy smoke , these people do n't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting . well , last picture show was a decent film , but this thing is a disaster & the rest of bogdonovitch 's pics have n't been much better . guess rubbing up against welles & hitch & ford wore off a long time ago . still good for hosting tcm though .
this version is pretty insipid , i 'm afraid . jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood , but william hurt 's weary , throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored , petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt ! i also ca n't believe that they eliminated edward 's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book , one of the most moving moments in literature . i do appreciate that they finally used such a young , plain woman to play jane , a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 , but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel , please see the 70 's version with george c. scott and susannah york . york was too old , tall and pretty to play jane , but no one has touched rochester 's character the way that scott did .
in keeping with disney 's well-known practice of stealing .. i mean .. buying out known properties and bastardizing them , this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes . i grew up on the original cartoon tv series . any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie . not present is penny 's cool computer book . also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief . new are a smooth talking gadget convertible ( the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car ) and an element of a typical , unrealistic hollywood romance . do n't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their _ex_executives - do n't see this movie .
with a cast of stalwart british character actors and pleasing photography of 1950s britain , i had hoped and expected to be more entertained by this film . unfortunately i found myself glued to it for the wrong reasons - i could n't quite believe how awful it was . i must have watched thousands of old films and am always ready to make allowances for them being products of their time , but this was really hard going . as others have noted , a major problem is that it does n't seem to know what it wants to be : a gentle romantic comedy , a slapstick comedy or a musical . i was a bit gobsmacked when jeannie carson suddenly broke into song about 15 minutes in ! it 's not believable on any level , either the storyline itself or the fact that daisy never appears to have an ounce of menace in her at any time . other aspects which defied credibility included the casting of suave donald sinden as a songwriter ( a songwriter for god 's sake ! ) , the fact he has diana dors for a fiancée and does n't appear to have the slightest interest in her ( i mean , diana dors ! come on ! ) and a ludicrous scene in a song publisher 's office . the whole thing 's silly in the worst possible way . if i had to pick a favourite scene it would be the one at the very beginning with that wonderful actor wilfred lawson - after that everything went downhill in a big way .
first off , i really loved henry fool , which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers . parker posey is one of best actresses on-screen today . but this film was a full-out travesty . watching hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride , and making pointless analogies to star wars - was stomach-turning . this was hype on the producers part ( hdnet ) realized to the max . a true example of the emperor and his new clothes . mostly i feel that hal has spoiled henry fool forever . i do n't think i can ever see it again in it 's pure , innocent light . remember hal , you can fool some of the people some of the time ... etc . the director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage . sadly , it 's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film adaptation . the story must be exciting and active , or its box-office hopes are dim indeed . never mind a decent story . for the actors , it was like trying to act in a straitjacket . the score , i believe hartley 's , is tasteless . with drum hits walking all over dialog . there was one apple soundtrack loop i recognized that gave me a smile . when i saw the trailer , i thought , oh , they 're just trying to grab a new audience . but it 's really this ridiculous ride . i 'd be happy to spoil this movie for you , but it 's been done . it 's rotten . the fool franchise is dead . long live henry fool .
hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly . you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy red/orange filter which makes everything very murky . the martian landscape/vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing . there are echoes of 'bride of the monster ' when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about , the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining . better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the 'sci-fi ' music score , repeated endlessly , will drive you insane . if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time .
.... shut it off . the prologue with fu manchu 's birthday , and the opening credits of the assassins training , is amusing . then it drops off faster than hair sprayed with neat . look for a cameo by cato in the beginning , with a figurative wink at the audience .
it 's unfortunate that you ca n't go any lower than one star . prior to watching the wicker man , i had considered aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars . in all fairness , the wicker man does n't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film , but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it . there is a cheap trick all too often used in hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion : slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful . it is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers . even more so in that the `` carefully crafted '' ( or however they put it ) conclusion did n't seem to follow logically from the plot ( which naturally i ca n't elaborate on without introducing spoilers ) , and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point . it is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths , pedophiles , and possibly die-hard nicholas cage fans , but only to a few of the mainstream audience . if you really want something along these lines , i heartily recommend m. night shyamalan 's the village instead . lacking some kind of memory-erasing pill , i suppose i need to watch something better to force it from my mind , say , attack of the killer tomatoes or pee-wee 's big adventure ?
i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros . i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that . but i came out of the theatre not knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia . the movie never really gets through to the person , his thoughts and feelings . what they did was to collect the little material that they had , shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire . it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all , and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say , `` oh , he was such an inspiration to all of us '' . like bono or johnny depp ( whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean ) . it seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of `` the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart '' that ever lived , sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him . sure , being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band , hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such , but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60-90 minutes . go see the movie if you are a fan , otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros , where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death , melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound .
i ca n't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie ! the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot , and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending . but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i 've ever wasted my time on . it 's just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth branagh 's character around by his nose . the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer , which has been left out in the sun too long . the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever and this is n't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie . do n't waste your time here !
sitting down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor ( `` on the wings of love '' ) , i knew i would be in for an `` interesting '' time . i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing ; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so . i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing , though its quality and morality are often lacking . `` on the wings of love '' details the journey taken by jake , a 31 year old commercial pilot from dallas , texas , to find true love , as true a love as one can find in a season-long reality-drama dating show . jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country . he begins to get to know them a bit , but it is mostly superficial ; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations ? jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning , at least to the audience . he noted that he does n't just want love or a good time , but he wants a fiancé or wife . we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well . if that is the case , it might explain , to a degree , some of the women 's actions . the women are super competitive . while they do n't even know jake at all yet , they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost . not only were the women competitive , but they were also confident and catty . threats , backstabbing , and warnings of `` watch out ! '' all show that these women were n't there for a good time either . jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal , but looking for `` a connection . '' however , the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal . they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either low-cut or short . while some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum , others missed that memo altogether . one girl , channy , noted that jake was a `` good guy '' to whom she could be a `` naughty girl . '' she went on to say that jake could land on her `` runway anytime . '' she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations . so , a reality dating show could n't be that bad , could it ? besides the obvious issue of sex-driven attraction , there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show . is this the right way to find a future mate ; vying for someone 's attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions ? unfortunately , however , that is what america has reduced dating to these days : pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side . another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake . a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached . one girl said `` if i do n't get that first impression rose it will kill me ! '' as mentioned before , they do n't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose , not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated . michelle , in particular , seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake . the other girls noticed it too . after one particular michelle outburst , vienna asserted that michelle had a `` mental breakdown and we 've only been here an hour . '' michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  narrowly missing elimination  and was extremely emotional about it . the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous . another girl also cried , but because she was eliminated . it began with survivor , and from there it just took off  reality tv . it shows our entertainment interests as a country ; if we were n't watching the shows and giving them good ratings , the networks would not continue to run them . the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked . one thing is clear : america ( in general ) loves reality tv and its ensuing trappings . this begs me to question : why is it that we even like reality tv ? what is it about it that draws us to it ? is it because we see the similarities to our own lives , or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others ? whatever it is that draws us to it , we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds . i 'm not saying that all reality tv shows are bad ; however , i am saying that we need to evaluate each one . episodes used for critique : season premier and episode 2 .
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film . the humor seems to be destined for corpses . it 's slow . the story is too simple to be true . the characters do not raise much sympathy , a few non-important characters aside . nothing surprising happens . what did the writers of this script think ? `` oooo funny ! let 's make some old lady 's high on pot ! let 's make them .... giggle ! let 's make them ... behave like little children ! ! oooo , yes , that 's absolutely brilliant and original ! '' this film has irritated me most from all the films i 've seen in the last five years .
this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off . i know these horrible things happen in the world , but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen . these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies , they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species . this should be banned and destroyed . i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market ! ! this movie should be removed from the public . the person who made this movie needs psychological help .
let me start by saying that i consider myself to be one of the more ( most ! ) open-minded movie-viewers ... movies are my passion , and i am a big regular at my local cult-movie-rental-place ... i also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about movies whenever i get there , and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult-movie-area ... i love to rent strange stuff , and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult-movie-video-place.he told me he thought i had to see this , and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a jodorowsky ( one of my favorites ! ) atmosphere , i rented it . the vote i gave here is not really fair , because i did not think it was awful , i just did not know how to rate it otherwise . a question mark would have been more appropriate ... this is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach : i actually felt physically ill ! am i the only one whose stomach literally turned ? still i did not want to turn it off , or maybe i just could n't because i was fascinated in a nasty way ... i do not ever wan na see this movie again . not awful , a 1 as i said.just not my cup of tea ( or wodka for that matter ) ...
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason ( herb ) evers constant harping on experiment . many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting . yet , as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done . jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune , and his overacting is exactly that . most of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors , minus evers and the showgirls . if you watch this movie , you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line , that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose . the special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one . in hindsight , there is n't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie .
this movie is truly brilliant . it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you do n't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past . but it does n't stop there ! this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy : behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like there 's no tomorrow ( and the way he swung it , i really am amazed there * was * a tomorrow for him , or at least , for his beer gut ) . do n't miss this movie , it 's a fantastic romp through idiocy , and sheer bloody mindedness ! and once you have finished watching this one , dry the tears of joy ( or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling ) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel !
i 've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv . i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it ... and no . at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the bambi movie , but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual . the info said that they were making fun of him because he was n't good at sports , but that was not the case . it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay . it was also very sad , as far as the ducky 's dad and all . i do n't know , i guess if you 're gay you 'd like it , but i do n't think i 'm going to watch it again with my little one .
there 's not a drop of sunshine in `` the sunshine boys '' , which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon 's sole ironic moment . simon , who adapted the script from his play ( which goes uncredited ) , equates old age with irrational behavior -- and , worse , clumsy , galumphing , mean-spirited irrational behavior . walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special ( it 's said they were a team for 43 years , which begs the question `` how long did vaudeville last , anyway ? '' ) . burns , who won a supporting oscar , has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in , after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back . the noisier the movie gets , the less tolerable and watchable it is . director herbert ross only did solid work when he was n't coupled with one of neil simon 's screenplays ; here , ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur , hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off ( such as semi-incoherent matthau showing up at a mechanic 's garage to audition for a tv commercial ) . at this point , matthau was still too young for this role , and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering . it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character , to nuance his temperament to give `` the sunshine boys '' some sunniness , yet walter continues to project as if we 'd all gone deaf . the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace ; one loses hope for it early on . * 1/2 from * * * *
william shatner in small doses is tolerable . unfortunately , instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation , and in that moderately amusing , it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it . just as occurred in the original star trek series . i guess i will never understand american humour , which frequently goes 'over the top ' to get the message through . i vote with my feet . i no longer watch the show , which is a shame , because the rest of the cast were good . it is pity that shatner 's overdone role also , affects james spader 's performance . but the majority demonstrate the way society is going , i guess . i do n't travel the same routes . frank
ben masters , ( kyd thomas ) , '' dream lover '' , '86 plays a sort of mike hammer character , a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . kyd makes one big mistake when he stops morgan fairchild , ( laura cassidy/eva bomberg ) , '' arizona summer '' , '73 from getting beaten up and raped . kyd takes laura home to his pad and when he wakes up , she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . by the way , kyd sleep in his bed and laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between kyd and laura . all said and done , this is a lousy picture and i purchased the dvd for only $ 1.50 and i really got ripped off !
what can you say about this movie ? it was not terrible , but it was not good ! two days earlier i had watched lillies and that was one of the best gay films i have ever seen . so this was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay flick . the story was silly and the acting was ok . it was not bad enough to turn off , but it had some bad moments and some terrible stereotyping . it was not very well cast either . would i recommend this movie ? no you would be wasting your time and money . i do n't understand why movies like these are made and who is funding them . spend your time watching noah 's arc on logo instead . i think this is where this movie was trying to go but never got there .
the story is about the life of common people from antwerp , living their lives . so i said it , and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story . the movie is fast , like an mtv-flick , and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films . so let 's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next deus-barman picture .
i did n't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do . it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you ca n't sleep , although admittedly it 's no better quality than that . it 's true that the acting is n't great - i thought marianne mcandrew as cathy beck , for example , came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot did n't really make sense to me . the becks are on a trip described by john ( stewart moss ) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had ( now that 's romantic ! ) the work part has something to do with touring caves , which in itself sounds strange ( how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone 's work ? ) but it gets stranger when we find out that he 's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine ( huh ? that connection completely lost me . ) bitten by a bat while he 's in the cave , he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a human-bat hybrid ( although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape-man of some sort ) and a killing spree starts . here 's another problem . the first killing is a nurse in a hospital . at first , everyone thinks her death was an accident . the second murder is of a young girl , who is described as having her throat ripped out . the sheriff ( michael pataki ) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse 's ( meaning throat ripped out ? - how could anyone think that was an accident ? ) and what 's with the sheriff ? he seems pretty no-nonsense until the scene in cathy 's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her , after which everything seems to go back to normal . it 's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved , and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i 've ever heard in a movie . even for all that , there was something here that kept me watching . sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half . pretty bad , yeah - but not as awful as some people say .
considering the original film version of 'the haunting '' is in my top ten films of all time ' i approached this adaption with trepidation . i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh , all those involved should be ashamed . the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason ! you see nothing . robert wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work 's . the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b , sadder still is that the ingredients were there ( actors such as liam neeson , catherine zeta jones ) to do something different . this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery !
this movie , no correction , this thing , this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer 's head . i could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie . but let 's try anyway . horrible , bad , nauseating , tasteless , crap , vomit inducing , gut wrenchingly bad , hideous , nasty , putrid , there just are n't enough words in the english language ! the `` plot '' involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man . do n't ask how , not important . the killer snowman runs about killing people . how , you may ask , can a snowman kill someone ? in tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you do n't have to endure that styrofoam snowman anymore . in ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore . do n't watch this movie ! destroy it on sight ! for the sake of your very soul do n't watch it !
i agree with everything people said on this one but i must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst one i have ever heard my entire life ! there are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk ! and the vocals are like a broadway version of danzig singing , `` the darkness of the forest ! oh the darkness of the dark , dark forest ! '' or something else so unthreatening . the singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string section and fake drum beats . it 's horrible ! ! yes , the male leads are awful . so are the female ones . this is one bad case of gender stereotyping - it 's so bad ! everything they say revolves around being a male or a female , just playing up the stereotypes to the max . makes me sick . soooo boring ! ! ! the children were so echoey in their lines , you could n't understand them . and why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair , pretty blue dresses and long hair ? and ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair ? not scary - stupid . daddy 's face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave . nice beard and bangs , pa. did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salon ? stupid movie .
`` shinobi '' is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story . unfortunately , for the audience to actually care about the people dying , you have to develop the characters , otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence . the problem is especially compounded when you have tons of characters , all of whom die . ok , so if you ca n't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way , you can at least make the reasons for why they die plausible , right ? nope . here we have a war between two ninja clans , with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other . they kill each other because the emperor says so . yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants all of them dead , they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions . that 's not stubbornness ... that 's just plain dumb . fine , fine ! there is no character development , and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting . at least they die fighting in cool action scenes , right ? yet again , no ! in fact , many of the fights are n't even fights at all : super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly ( and lamely , in my opinion ) . i 'm talking about things like , `` lalala , i 'm walking along and i- * neck gets slashed * . '' the end for that character . not even halfway through the film , i threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it .
the plot is about a female nurse , named anna , is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living . she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer . so far , so good ! i usually enjoy horror movies , but this piece of film does n't deserve to be called horror . it 's not even thrilling , just ridiculous.even `` the flintstones '' or `` kukla , fran and ollie '' will give you more excitement . it 's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor . the heroes who has locked themselves in , inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside , are not better either . even though they does n't seem to be drunk , they give the impression of being mentally disabled . save your money instead of spending it on this !
it was agonizingly bad movie . it will eat your heart out while you watch it . i beg you : do n't watch this movie ! you will hate you losing 1,5 hours of your lifetime ! it 's not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy ... this movie is boring as ... there is nothing as boring as this movie . you will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end . and you will hate yourself that you did n't listen to me . i hate myself . i tortured myself and i did watch this movie to the end . now excuse me , i will shot myself . i have seen all . please . read this very carefully . do n't watch this film . please !
it seems to me that stephen king 's `` bachman '' pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer , rawer , more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without 'contaminating ' his 'brand name ' . if you look back at the `` bachman books '' ( running man , the long walk , roadwork , thinner ) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream king . i realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated , blood-covered , emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom ... but mainstream king always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit , and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling . bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly . ( btw , `` pet semetary '' could have easily been a bachman book if king had n't revealed the alias by then . and `` the dark half '' seems to be at least partially about his `` bachman '' persona . ) `` thinner '' was the last bachman book , and man , with its themes of class warfare , revenge , and death by starvation , it is nasty . so it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit . what is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a `` tv movie of the week '' level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release . ( these days , something like this would probably go directly to dvd or cable ) . the makeup work and the striking motif ( starving to death in the midst of plenty , a metaphor for the overfed , undernourished american middle class if there ever was one ) is all that keeps you watching this misfire . what went wrong ? my first thought is that the director was going for the nasty bachman vibe , but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here ( with the exception of joe monetegna ) simply ca n't carry the movie . and then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure . plus he could n't leave the plot alone , and his changes do n't really help . the script and dialog ought to work , but mostly the movie just lies there . everything is muffled , dull , airless , and no fun to watch ... with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting .... thinner , and thinner , and thinner . as other have pointed out , `` thinner '' is by no means the worst king movie ever made ( or even the second worst ) . and it does have a dreadful , compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work . but first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations .
you , know , i can take the blood and the sex , but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in . someone get that girl some pasta before it 's too late ! and you know , it 's just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it 's ripping off . i gave this one a 2 , just because it 's marginally better than tobe hooper 's crocodile .
unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from kerry conran , for whom this is clearly a labour of love . unfortunately it 's just not that good . it all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score , a mixture of lucas and hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a spielberg . the movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels , serials and films as diverse as the day the earth stood still , superman , metropolis , planet of the apes , the iron giant , star wars and the spy who loved me . the film however , fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons : the main being that it 's such a labour of love , so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world , conran actually forgets about making a movie . there is little to no tension , atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles , dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces . even the noir elements fall flat . this is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it 's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards . the actors do n't get to do much either - jude law is wooden , gwyneth paltrow is annoying and stupid , angelina jolie is wasted - and it 's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything . it is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday . nice ending though .
any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake . alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just does n't work . while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish . mcqueen had charisma , never try to compete with a star . as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said . mcqueen looked dangerous , menacing and believable as doc , the film had excitement and suspense , baldwin and company made this into a comedy , i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film . and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of today 's more exciting and believable actors ! did the makeup people have it in for michael , what were they thinking.if you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam peckinpah 's direction get the original !
well , it 's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what 's to be said . but the thing is , i have seen zillions of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i 've seen . so , i have to write something . the acting is stupid . it 's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash . the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child . the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be . do n't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary . we do n't see how the granpa is killed . the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die , you just do n't sympathize with them . and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better . we just hear him scream and we see nothing !
birthday girl does n't know what it wants to be - is it a comedy , , is it a drama ... it just does n't know . what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man 's land . the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out . this is a real shame if you look at the cast - it 's very solid all the way through but they do n't get the chance to shine . very disappointing .
a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just does n't get it . they never did . and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion . this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons . the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes , led by former nba star alex english , join his cause . not just a few of them join the cause . by the time his movement reaches its zenith , entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more . just to move this review along , i 'm prepared to grant them this premise . even though it would never happen in a million years , i 'll just imagine it could , then go from there . i do n't quite remember how , but some type of agreement is reached , and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene . before criticizing the message of this film , let me just say that this film is poorly written , acted and directed . even if one does agree with the boy 's stance , it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed . and that 's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste . ( peck , curtis , petersen ) . alex english does as well as he could have with his character however , and i wish he would try to act in more films . alas , it 's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba . one wishes mr. english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better . alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop . as far as the film 's message in concerned , it 's just wrong-headed . plain and simple . all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war ! ! ! ! ! it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons . these weapons were in fact never used , and that was the genius behind their existence . neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile . without these weapons , who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr . the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck 's footsteps . kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck . the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars . if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war , stick with dr. strangelove , instead . mr. newell , you are no frank capra !
this movie was recently released on dvd in the us and i finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem . it even came with original theatrical previews of other italian horror classics like `` spasmo '' and `` beyond the darkness '' . unfortunately , the previews were the best thing about this movie . `` zombi 3 '' in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous lucio fulci `` zombie '' franchise which began in 1979 . similarly compared to `` zombie '' , `` zombi 3 '' consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this 'horror ' trash barely afloat . the gore is nearly non-existent ( unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces ) and the english dubbing is a notch below embarrassing . the plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ( ie . an idiotic male and his stupid female side-kick ) who are developing some sort of chemical called `` death one '' that is supposed to re-animate the dead . unless my ears need to be checked , i do n't even recall a reason for the research of `` death one '' . it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star ' in this cinematic laugh-fest . anyway , `` death one '' is experimented on a corpse ( whom i swear looked like yul brynner ) , and after it is injected into his system , he sits upright and his head explodes ! the sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse 's face bubbles with green slime , the sound of 'paper crumpling ' can be heard . the `` death one '' toxin is transported outside and is 'hi-jacked ' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it , but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial . needless to say , the guy turns into a zombie , but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel , infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror ( ! ) . the military catch wind of this and immediately take action before 'eliminating ' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the 'contamination zone ' and turn the motel upside down . they find the infected thief and burn his body , only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack ( ! ) . we cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army , listening to 'groovy music ' that is coming out of a little dinky boom-box while trailing a trailer-load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests . can someone say `` zombie food '' ? we also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie ' smoke ! the birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water . this is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie . she walks around this old dirty , rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud , `` hello ? is there anyone here ? please , i just need some water ! '' she encounters a group of zombies , one of which is chained to a wall ( ! ) and the other is swinging a machete . after a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground , she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter . meanwhile , the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected . they all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place , and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place . after a matter of hours ( a day at the most ) , the same motel is now caked in dust , has vines growing throughout it , and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years . anyway , what better place to take refuge than this particular building ? needless to say , the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack . the third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village , of which the woman comments , `` this place is a dump ! '' she then proceeds to get 'pushed ' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna ( ? ) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds ! meanwhile , her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected hours earlier is still turning into a zombie ! unfortunately , there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words . for example , the time rate concerning infected people being 'zombified ' differs greatly . sometimes it takes seconds , other times it takes hours . some zombies run , others drag their feet and walk really slow . some even do kung-fu moves , while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people . some of the zombies even talk ! the funniest moment of course is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge ' gag which 'elevates ' itself in mid-air and 'attacks ' a stupid man who goes looking for food . funnily enough , his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it 's 'headless ' counter-part ( lmao ! ) . the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies . we never get to see them come back as zombies , in fact the only ones we do see 'zombified ' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off . other than that , i was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and/or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies . it is also amazing that these zombies only take a 'few bites ' and then move on to their next victim . the most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus . a pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital . a woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge ' tries to deliver the baby ( ! ) and has her face pulled off by a zombie , before having her head pushed into the woman 's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off . timeless ! as usual , all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre . the megalomaniacal military officer , the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed , the obvious characters who are about to get killed ( ie . watch for the man chasing a chicken ! ) i guess this movie really is a comedy . there were many laughable scenes , such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade ( obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent ) and a climatic scene where a man screams , `` i 'm thirsty .... thirsty for your blood ! '' . the costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film , wearing the same 'asian-like ' clothing that may be found in a bruce lee film , and watch out for the blue 60 's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man . the end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line . a radio dj who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the 'beginning of the end ' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter . hardly `` dawn of the dead '' material if you ask me . regardless , this movie does deliver many laughs . the gore is minimal , and what gore there is , it is very unconvincing , let alone unimaginative . the usual mix of black blood , thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and 'zombie make-up ' consisting of green moss . `` zombi 3 '' makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn . other than that , horror fans should stay away . 3 out of 10
i would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time ... when i 've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our ( kazakhstan ) government ... it 's a shame , because 'qazaqfil 'm ' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of shaken aimanov , but it was actually ran by him . the movies like 'konec atamana ' , 'kyz zhibek ' or even 'aldar kose ' . but after mr aimanov 's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced . however , in late 1980s , 'assa ' was shot , it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country , one year later mr. rashid nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer v.tsoy , at that time he was already a soviet/russian rock legend , - the movie called 'igla ' ( the needle or something ) it was completely new , somebody called that period as resurrection or a new kazakh movie wave . unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies , our directors shooting movies on the french and japanese financial support , and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics , some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products ... and again back to our 'nomads ' . such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects . the same effects was with nikita mikhalkov 's 'sibirski cyrilnik ' about russian tsars , that was also shot on parities with foreign partners , i think they were french or maybe british . nobdy liked it , even in russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'kvn ' . imho
well then . i just watched an crap-load of movies -- all with varying degrees of quality . i was n't too sure about which one i wanted to review first . then it hit me like a sack-a-rats : rodentz . warn people about rodentz . this monstrosity stars nobody and is painfully dull to sit through . and it 's about mutant rats killing people . yeah ... real freaking ' original . `` food of the gods , '' or `` willard '' anyone ? those were better than this , and that does n't say much ... * * possible spoiler * * okay here 's the story : inna laboratory the scientist and his plucky assistant are experimenting on rats and their laboratory is in a crappy neighborhood and crappy building and the plucky assistant 's moronic friends show up drunk and everyone becomes food for the crazed rats and just about everybody dies and , oh yeah , there 's one giant rat that looks crappy , but it gets killed , the end . there , all in once sentence ! spoiler , you say ? ppfff ! ! i beg to differ ! the second we all realize that there 's a giant rat , we all know it 's gon na die eventually ! ! * * end spoiler * * here 's the breakdown : the good : -- well , i watched it for free , but for everyone else ... hmmm , no . there 's nothing good here . did n't hurt it , did n't help : -- um ... well . the gore was decent . -- very average cinematography . -- cg rats not as bad as they could 've been in some shots ... the bad : -- ... and in other shots , the cg rats were pathetically cheap-looking . look , if your film has a low budget , maybe you should n't rely on cg . lesson to take to heart . -- the acting is extremely poor . -- the characters are beyond uninteresting -- we have a mish-mash of clichés and none of them are even done that well . -- booooooooooooring . -- been done before -- plenty of times . -- stupid story , just stupid . -- giant rat looks like fat man in poorly conceived bear costume -- that was kind of funny -- but not funny enough to give this film any worth . -- retarded , unrealistic , and boring dialog . -- all the college student rat chow people are drinking tequila from huge plastic milk jugs -- and yet they do n't appear to be drunk for anything longer than a few seconds . way to stick with continuity , guys . the ugly : -- this film is bad . simply terrible . worse than you might imagine . it 's not even laughably bad like , for instance , `` scarecrow '' ( 2002 ) or `` house of the dead . '' now those movies are crap you can enjoy . even if they do make you stupider . memorable scene : -- the lame action-movie ending , complete with uninjured heroes and explosion . because it did n't feel at all like the rest of this monstrosity -- but still sucked . acting : 2/10 story : 1/10 atmosphere : 2/10 cinematography : 4/10 character development : 0/10 special effects/make-up : 4/10 nudity/sexuality : 1/10 ( i was tending to my son occasionally during the film , so i may have missed it , but was supposedly in there ) violence/gore : 4/10 dialogue : 2/10 music : 1/10 ( average for the time ) writing : 1/10 direction : 2/10 cheesiness : 7/10 crappiness : 9/10 overall : 1/10 watch it only if you love rat and vermin-based horror films . wait ... check that . do n't watch it . it 's crap .

when the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the blockbuster . but honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser . the movie has a tag-line - `` preeti madhura , tyaga amara '' which means love 's sweet but sacrifice is immortal . in the movie the hero of the movie ( ganesh ) sacrifices his love for the leading lady ( pooja gandhi ) even though the two loved each other ! his justification is the meaning of the tag-line . this movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this `` loser-like sacrificial '' attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is , when they could have moved on with their lives . ganesh 's acting in the movie is amateurish , crass and childishly stupid . he actually looks funny in a song , ( onde ondu sari ... ) when he 's supposed to look all stylish and cool . his looks do n't help the leading role either . his hair style is badly done in most part of the movie . pooja gandhi cant act . her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent . the good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by mano murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie . also the lyrics by jayant kaikini are very well penned . the director yograj bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner . anyway all-in-all except for the songs , the movie is a very ordinary one ! ! ! ! ! !
the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality : go find a girl , marry her , live with her happily ever after . though the film had some fine moments and turns , most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline . the baptist/mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about , probably intentionally . a more interesting story would have been a mixed couple . if you wan na see a film which does n't need too much concentration , which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values ( besides the modern tolerance stuff ; - ) ) , you will be fine with this film . might be shown at a family-home-evening ...
monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil american concrete factory ( are there any else in hollywood ? ) polluting the waters of the small colombian town of chimayo somehow creating a catfish-like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women . james mitchum is bill travis the man who is sent down to chimayo by his foul-mouthed boss barnes who himself ca n't keep his hands off of his secretary 's rear to get to the bottom ( pun intended ) of the story . while in chimayo bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect english directly back to america . i guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small south american towns . there is also a radical named sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which , by the way , also supplies the town with jobs for the locals , but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy-feely enviro-marxism . pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex-girlfriend on the beach , tells her that he is seeing the mayor 's daughter juanita and it 's over between them , then she is promptly eaten that night . a little side action without the evidence . my hat is off to you sir . john carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by god to punish sinners . you can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face . might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check did n't bounce . supposedly based on a true story , so much so they say it twice in the opening credits , this film is awful on all fronts . filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when kenneth hartford put his foot on the throat of monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters , even putting his daughter , andrea in top billing with mitchum and carradine . the sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming . this is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night . the monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending . james mitchum along with his brother chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed . utterly unwatchable dreck . shame on you john carradine .
what an insult to the sa film industry ! i have seen better sa films . the comments i read about hijack stories , by saying it is worthy of a ten out of ten is quite scary . a movie 's rating should not depend on .. , `` oh , a movie from a developing country . lets boost their industry by saying nice things about their work , even though it is bad . '' we have the expertise to make good movies . do n't judge the film industry on what people say how great they think hijack stories is . we can tell great stories such as cry the beloved country and shaka zulu . cry the beloved country i 'll give 9 out of 10 . great directing by darryl , great acting by two great elderly actors , irrespective from where they are . hijack stories .. , i 'll give 1 out of 10 . it could only be people involved in the project who would give it high scores . i would 've done the same if it was my movie .
you know you 're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie , and `` the incubus '' is a dreadful , worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills . actually , observing the hammy script and john hough 's 'baroque ' art direction , one can hardly blame him . the movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town , with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in . somehow , the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene , and cassavetes seems visibly p.o . 'ed at times . the incubus itself , which does n't show up until the last scene , is a well-done creation , but it 's not worth waiting for . 1/10
if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs . when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house . half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty . we refused to leave thinking it would get better . when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre . the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight . in interviews with `` mr. mike '' he refused to comment on this film . the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day . we all tried to contact `` mr. mike '' by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored .
i loved adrianne curry before this show . i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won . i also liked chris knight , he seems like a great guy . but this show just made me sick ! i 'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show . i do n't care that they were different ages , i know age ca n't stand between love . but adrianne , you had been together for only seven months . it did n't surprise me at all that he had n't proposed . and i do n't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they 're ready . if it 's meant to be , then why not just enjoy each other 's company and love each other , and let it come naturally ? turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary , it 's stupidly obvious that chris loves you , with or without a ring . and chris , shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway ! you 've been through two failed marriages , how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit ? i hope the relationship lasts , but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons . maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage .
from the star of `` mitchell '' , from the director of `` joysticks '' and `` angel 's revenge '' ! ! ! these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie . and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ! ! ! ugghhh ... joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film . it 's like a bad remake of `` coogan 's bluff ''
this `` clever '' film was originally a japanese film . and while i assume that original film was pretty bad , it was made a good bit worse when american-international films hacked the film to pieces and inserted american-made segments to fool the audience . now unless your audience is made of total idiots , it becomes painfully obvious that this was done -- and done with little finesse or care about the final product . the bottom line is that you have a lot of clearly japanese scenes and then clearly american scenes where the film looks quite different . plus , the american scenes really are meaningless and consist of two different groups of people at meetings just talking about gamera -- the evil flying turtle ! and although this is a fire-breathing , flying and destructive monster , there is practically no energy because i assume the actors were just embarrassed by being in this wretched film -- in particular , film veterans brian donlevy and albert dekker . they both just looked tired and ill-at-ease for being there . now as for the monster , it 's not quite the standard godzilla-like creature . seeing a giant fanged turtle retract his head and limbs and begin spinning through the air like a missile is hilarious . on the other hand , the crappy model planes , destructible balsa buildings and power plant are , as usual , in this film and come as no surprise . plus an odd japanese monster movie cliché is included that will frankly annoy most non-japanese audience members , and that is the `` adorable and precocious little boy who loves the monster and believes in him '' . yeah , right . well , just like in godzilla versus the smog monster and several other films , you 've got this annoying creep cheering on the monster , though unlike later incarnations of godzilla , gamera is not a good guy and it turns out in the end the kid is just an idiot ! silly , exceptional poor special effects that could be done better by the average seven year-old , bad acting , meaningless american clips and occasionally horrid voice dubbing make this a wretched film . oddly , while most will surely hate this film ( and that stupid kid ) , there is a small and very vocal minority that love these films and compare them to bergman and kurosawa . do n't believe them -- this is a terrible film ! fyi -- apparently due to his terrific stage presence , gamera was featured in several more films in the 60s as well as some recent incarnations . none of these change the central fact that he is a fire-breathing flying turtle or that the movies are really , really lame .
this movie kind of reminds me of a mary-kate and ashley movie-only worse . just the rich sisters kind of thing i think even though alysons more the actress , in this movie amanda michalka was okay sometimes but alysons acting stunk . i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely was n't it . the story line was n't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and courtney . i 'm not a big alyson michalka fan and this movie did n't make me like her any better . i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do ( which sadly i did n't )
just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match . the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value . in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany , new york with the wwe championship . those men were current champion john cena , kurt angle and shawn michaels . there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies ; carlito or chris masters . and kane ? kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998 , and that was only for one night . it was obvious he was n't going to be the one either . last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer . 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far . the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event . out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber . it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there . with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe . this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night . the undercard , like last year , was truly atrocious . triple h and the big show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away . hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it ? any pay-per-view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it . the king pinned helms ( who books this stuff ? ) and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help from his mama . the women of the wwe also had a busy night . there was the usual diva nonsense with a bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman 's championship was also on the line . in a match , i thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in a good match . trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future . the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion , ric flair . this could have been better but it was a battered and bloody flair that retained after a disqualification finish . edge obviously had bigger fish to fry . so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar in disastrous fashion . the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up . they do n't get much worse than this .
i would n't recommend this unless you 're keen on david copperfield and want to `` complete the set '' . there are some good performances ( e.g . uriah heep ) and well directed moments ( e.g . the beating ) , but on the whole it really pales in comparison with the 1999 bbc version , as well as earlier versions . there are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except , possibly , to dumb it down ( the stolen jewels being a case in point ) . the american cast were poorly chosen : sally field is a good actress , but she is wrong as betsy trotwood , and her english accent is only slightly better than dick van dyke 's cockney . i can see why michael richards was chosen to play mr micawber ; he hams it up rather too much , however , and becomes irritating . he also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous . anthony andrews is menacing as mr murdstone , but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie david 's mother to a railway line ( though this is perhaps partly the fault of dickens ) . i got this for free with a newspaper . it helped pass a sunday afternoon , but i felt more disappointed than charmed at the end of it
deep shock plays out like a tv movie : a whole cast of commercial-quality actors , a poorly designed creature to be the `` bad guy , '' and a script that is more full of technical , political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with . i checked out the movie because of the creature ( i love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos ) , and right off the bat , i got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie . the actors i expected because of the type of film it is ( really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point ) . the music was typical , not-thought-out action symphonic music . i liked the design of the computers and technical equipment , along with the mini-sub design . the movie even flowed really well , with guiding screens letting you know which set you 're watching the story unfold in . but there is n't much of a story here anyways . this movie gets a 3/10 stars imo . the boring search and destroy mission to blow up the north pole and these creatures protecting it ... kinda lame . even lamer is the tagged-on love relationship between two of the characters that you do n't see coming . chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors ' careers off the bench and into a video . do n't bother .
`` drawing restraint 9 '' is a kind of movie one either loves or hates ; fortunately or not , i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time and of being thoroughly stuffed with `` killing whales is bad '' propaganda . aesthetically , the movie could have been pleasing , especially its first half , until it is not clear that every action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting . until then , it might be slightly amusing to look at daily chores of japan workers , but later it becomes obvious that anything that appears on the screen is a propaganda , and no single frame is an exception . i use the word `` propaganda '' because the movie uses basically the old morality play device , where `` good '' and `` bad '' are not deduced in the course of action but are set in stone . probably it 's just me , but i find such type of art shallow and preconceived , even when it 's all about the noble ( no sarcasm here ) quest of protecting the environment . in my opinion it is a cardinal sin when a movie material is stretched out without any justification , for the sake of stretching only . in my opinion , `` drawing restraint 9 '' could 've been easily fit into 75 minutes , but has a torturous length of 2 and 1/4 hours . yes , there were interesting shots , but there were not enough of these to leave 15-minute gaps of nothingness without notice . the movie has no standard scenario , and there 's no evolution of characters , but neither it is a documentary , it 's rather a kind of conceptual installation . that 's an unusual form for a movie , but it still can be viewed as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as here . otoh i also believe that the director should 've had some honesty and did not pretend that it could be only delivered in no less than 135 minutes . and yes , the music score mostly resembled whale sounds . how surprising . 2/10 .
the only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining . i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again . even for a tv movie it is flat . the cast is boring . the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand . how two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century . there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise , and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off . if you are tempted to see this , pop it in , set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and get comfy . with any luck you 'll doze off quickly , and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over . namely , this movie .
national lampoon 's class reunion was a flop when it was released . it did n't stay long in theaters in my big city . why ? because it 's bad ! ! ! ! ! not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way . the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey . the idea is actually great ( a parody of slasher flicks ) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect . just avoid this `` comedy '' . your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire .
this is one of those movies in which people keep saying `` that 's a great idea ! '' about the worst ideas you 've ever heard . then they act on them . i like it . this picture 's funnier than any 3 dozen seth rogen projects . well , so is shoah . gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin-stories since the 60s , but this one goes further . what can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck ? this travesty presents a ww2 suicide brigade on `` the last of the marshall islands '' presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the us marines away . then the japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man , and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard . they retreat to the mainland , where one of them becomes a business tycoon . then it gets complicated . blonde men from the future , irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness , come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating godzilla before he destroys japan . the `` help '' is questionable , as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed-circuit tv , but , hey , they shot the script . you would think that by the 90s the japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships . fortunately for nippon , the white guys - you can tell they 're american because they say `` nucyaler '' - erred by bringing back in time the one japanese girl left in the future . in a touching display of ancestor worship , she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a sailor moon backpack . turns out these time-traveling , fashion-disabled caucasians are just jealous of japan 's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world ( in the 22d century japan 's going to buy africa , which sounds more like a liability than an asset ) . these blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace godzilla with king ghidorah , who will destroy all of japan except tokyo . a strange choice , but toho 's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that tokyo skyline set again . sure enough , we are given the alternate spectacle of fukuoka ( `` my garden city '' ) and some other heretofore unscathed-by-rubber-monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra . in a surprise revelation , we are informed that king ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave . godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down . wait - did n't the spaceship blondes already destroy godzilla ? yeah , they killed him in the third reel . but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles - `` ha ha , do n't worry . we do n't keep it in japanese waters '' - with which to jumpstart a new godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur . only they do n't have to , because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made godzilla whole again . oh , and godzilla finally gets to tokyo , reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition . they look into each other 's eyes , and godzilla nods as if to say , `` got ta do it , man . '' the tycoon nods in understanding . then godzilla blows him up . i should also mention here that , in order to prevent godzilla 's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying japan , the japanese girl from the future goes back to the future to ask for help from - yes - a balding white man . probably because he pities her as the sole asian character from the 23d century , he agrees to build a mecha-ghidora and send it back to the 1990s , so that together , these two giant monsters can , uh , fulfill godzilla 's destiny and destroy japan . in a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping heads , the girl piloting mecha-ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick . this godzilla suit design owes much to the sumo - his thighs are flabby enough to double for rush limbaugh 's , and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous . but there 's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures , which makes up for a lot . also features a man with a passing resemblance to robert patrick playing a killer robot . yes , in the future even the robots will have bald spots . plus megumi odaka , reprising her role as micki , the only japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that . it 's not her fault : many japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy-foot screen is n't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face . i did some acting for japanese television , and i can tell you , they push you to go for it . they apparently urge their writers in the same way . thank god .
i hope the viewer who regards 'dream machine ' as one of corey haim 's finest and the `` best movies of the century '' was kidding . undetected sarcasm on my part ? i sincerely hope so . 'the dream machine ' marks the first of a long line of mediocre capers that would plague the rest of corey haim 's career ( except 'prayer of the rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) . here , haim plays nonchalant college boy , bernie , who supposes that a cool car will attract his dream girl 's attention . lucky for bernie , a rich woman aiming to get back at her cheating husband , hastily decides to reward her faithful piano tuner -- bernie -- with a gift : a slick porsche turbo . however , unbeknownst to the woman , and unfortunate for bernie , is that her dead husband was murdered and his body was hidden in the trunk . now , being that in this movie , bodies do n't seem to decay or possess a rather foul funk , bernie is unaware of this . in fact , the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise . in particular , a grizzly man follows him around , desperate to get hold of that body relatively undetected . this is a low-grade action fizzle as many of haim 's films like this are ( see the double o kid ) . despite being part action , part romantic comedy , this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minutes in which the filmmakers take more than enough time to show the immediate problem ( i.e . bernie being in possession of a car and a dead body , and a hit-man finding out that the porsche is going to be hard to find ) . after which , and thanks to poor acting by haim ( i loved this kid , too , but it 's not exactly sacrilegious to admit the times when he obviously could n't act well ) and the lack of real immediacy and emergency between bernie and the villain that makes much of the events unconvincing and as a result , inappreciable . to add injury to insult , the soundtrack was unbelievably laughable and sounded more like self-evident songs you would hear in team america ( see the 'date ' montage ) . loyal corey haim fans , however , should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance . however , others understanding that haim 's career probably peaked when he was 14 or 15 and never recovered , might expect mediocrity , as will viewers just looking for early 90s b-comedy fluff to pass the time .
i have seen and liked the original film , and expected more from a remake than this . good : effects and makeup are good . no complaints about the score and visuals , they are adequate , and the performances were okay ( tim roth was excellent , the other principals were fine , and a handful of the `` supporting supporting actors '' did very well with extremely limited roles ) . the action scenes were exciting and fun . bad : the escape from the ape city was terrible . the characters are going in circles , then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape . plus , what escape route leads through everybody 's bedroom ? the story was pared down to include as much action as possible . i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect . finally , the ending was completely nonsensical as presented . without seeing the inevitable sequel , there is no justification for it .
writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa . he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks . the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time , and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film . unfortunately sibrel 's research is so slipshod that he does n't realize his `` backstage '' footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast ( also on that reel ) that was seen by millions , not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies . and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts ' audio in the footage , because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera , not faking footage . finally , anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel 's hacked-up version of it . ( he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk 's assassination than of his `` smoking gun '' . ) sibrel thinks he 's the only one who 's seen it . what 's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use , such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth , destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth . as with most films of this type , sibrel relies on innuendo , inexpert assumption , misleading commentary , and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence .
in all my years of film-going , only once have i walked out on a film , and that was the dreadful `` stay tuned . '' fortunately , the cinema refunded the ticket and i went to see `` buffy the vampire slayer '' instead ( a minor improvement ) . that film is `` gone with the wind '' compared to `` dick , '' a comedy so unfunny that it nearly became the second film i ever walked out of . `` dick '' was so unfunny it was even impossible to laugh at it , let alone laugh with it . granted , paying to see a movie with a title like `` dick '' suggests that it will be filled with inane `` dick '' jokes and wind up a huge letdown , and yet i had high hopes because of the notable cast ( daniel hedaya , bruce mccullough , dave foley , kristen dunst , etc. , etc . ) and a premise that at least promised something fresh . what the film delivered was , as portended , four woefully predictable `` dick '' jokes , comic timing suffering from jetlag , and a premise that wore thin after the first five minutes . in short , it was the watergate scene from `` forrest gump '' stretched -- nay , laid on a rack and mangled -- over 90+ excruciating minutes . as soon as you understand that the two main characters -- airless , insipid squealers who gasp and roll eyeballs incessantly -- will participate in every major watergate event , you begin to mentally check off the plot as it progresses : 18 and a half minutes erased from the nixon tapes , check ; the deep throat meetings with woodward and bernstein , check ; john dean getting a change of heart and testifying , check . the process drags out more languidly and about as engaging as the real watergate affair with about as much laugh-getting to boot . and though it posits to be an amusing re-deconstruction of the events leading to president nixon 's resignation , it turns into a paint-by-the-numbers , choose-your-own-adventure , fill-in-the-blanks comedy that says very little and entertains even less . even the film 's strong point -- the aforementioned cast -- is bewilderingly unproductive here . the most disappointing of all is harry shearer as g. gordon liddy . trapped as he is behind the thick liddy moustache and strait-jacketed in this numbingly morose screenplay , shearer mumbles a few lines , tries desperately to leer from behind the prosthetic nose and eyebrows , then disappears . dave foley , one of the comic masterminds from kids in the hall ( two others , bruce mccullough and mark mckinney also appear in this film -- ah , the blessings of nepotism ) fares badly as well . his h.r . haldeman occasionally lends a much-need lightening of the funeral plot , but the funniest thing about him is the buzz-cut he sports -- perhaps the films funniest bit of all . and then there 's daniel hedaya as richard nixon -- oops , i mean `` dick . '' ( ha ha how amusingly funny . ) he manages to play a solid nixon , avoiding the pitfalls ( such as overdone make up , rubbery nose and false teeth a la anthony hopkins ) while preserving the essence ( the vacillations between human tenderness and coarseness ) . i seem to be forgetting someone . . . oh yes , the two stars of the film , those over-bubbly teenagers . ca n't remember their names , perhaps because i have repressed their performances . nothing could be farther from funny ; nothing could be more painful than having to endure their deliverly that ran the gamut of `` hyperactive '' and `` super-hyperactive '' with an occasional `` pouty '' tossed in . this film seemed to be a bad excuse to string together a 70s soundtrack and parade outrageous period clothing , both of which seem to be the norm these days for films and tv shows set in the `` me decade . '' but the clothes and the music wind up being an ersatz substitute for true characterization and plot , a kind of extra-plot shorthand that the producers hope will compensate for anemic writing . the only possible use for this film is years down the road when any one of its talented cast appears on david letterman or conan o'brien . this dreadful cinematic excretion will be dragged out to embarrass and hopefully humble the stunned guest star . the sad thing is that the real bad guys in all this -- the writers and producers -- will be far from the cameras gaze , possibly cooking up another disaster such as this .
i could n't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons : robin williams and toni collete . the film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on . robin williams plays gabriel noon , a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues : his lover moves out and gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller 's block . one day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named pete boland ( rory culkin ) . pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents . he lives with his adopted mother and social worker , donna boland ( toni collette ) . gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with pete , but things seem strange when gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that pete boland may not even exist . i wo n't go into detail because i do n't want to spoil the film , but i will tell you this : it is quite predictable . fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from robin williams and toni collette , who i thought was the film 's key character . collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses . her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and i hope to see her win an oscar ( hell , i think she might pull off getting a best supporting actress nod for this one if the script were a little better ) . the film starts off as a psychological thriller , but a predictable one at that . if your curious to know the film 's ending and twists , then see the film otherwise i would rent another predictable thriller called `` hide and seek '' .
carnosaur 3 : primal species ( 1996 ) d : jonathan winfrey . scott valentine , janet gunn , rick dean , anthony peck , rodger halston , terri j. vaughn , billy burnette . why even bother reviewing this movie ? another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal ( and very fake-looking ) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways . the original was bad enough , the sequel was even worse . this falls somewhere in between , though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films . rating : 2 out of 10 . rated r for graphic violence and gore , grisly images , and profanity .
okay , now what the hell is this supposed to be ? is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg 's `` close encounters of the third kind '' ? or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as `` when dinosaurs ruled the earth '' and `` the lost world '' ? perhaps it 's an intellectual & philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend ? yes , that must be it ! whatever it is , the creators of `` the day time ended '' ( good old john 'bud ' cardos of `` kingdom of the spiders '' and writer david schmoeller of `` tourist trap '' ) must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres . the story does n't make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but , hey , who cares as long as it 's got papier-mâché dinosaurs , miniature spacecrafts , headache-inducing light & laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas ! the voice-over introduction is practically inaudible , but no worries as it 's all gibberish ! did you know that the definition of 'time ' is n't what we all think it is ? time does n't necessarily pass by chronologically , it is one giant paradox ! words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us . i have absolutely no idea what all this means , but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap-dancing midget aliens and well-mannered dinosaurs on screen together . i deliberately say well-mannered dinosaurs , because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets . the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar-powered house in the middle of nowhere . grandpa is extremely annoying , the granddaughter even more , granny is a walking & talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery , the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is incredibly hot ! chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy 's husband on business travel . the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable ( i sincerely hope that the other reviewer who talked about `` excellent special effects '' was being sarcastic ) , but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs ! just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing : grandpa : `` you know what this is , do n't you ? this is a time-space warp ! stevie : `` i 'm not quite sure if i know what that means , dad '' grandpa : `` well , i guess nobody really does '' make up your mind , gramps ! do you know what it is or do n't you ? and stop talking about `` the vortex '' like you 're some kind of expert in the field ! `` the day time ended '' is an incredibly childish and not-worth-bothering-for fantasy movie , though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects . the ending completely comes out of nowhere , like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly .
cq could have been good , campy fun . but it commits the only unforgivable sin : it is b-o-r-i-n-g ! the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that it 's next to impossible to care where it 's going . the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label : `` caution : student film . fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker . ''
what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel . i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original . this version is no different . i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever ... anyway back to this version . it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style . it succeeds in both but high art it is nit . throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe ... the direction was average and the editing abysmal . worse than the old quincy . deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents . the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project . although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had . its clear that he was a director for hire and did n't instill the project with the passion that it deserved .
mst 3000 should do this movie . it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen . first of all , you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash . there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job . also , the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot . this movie sucked . i can not express the extremite that this movie was . every single actor was terrible . even the chick at the trailer park . i crap on this garbage . what a waste of time .
i saw this movie at the edmonton international film festival , with the great dr. uwe boll in attendance . the film is , simply put , very , very bad . and no , not in the usual uwe boll `` so bad it 's actually entertaining '' way , but just plain bad . the plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life ( because of a past criminal record , apparently ) , ca n't get a job , and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife . this man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus . al qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys , and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence . the acting is awful ( except for dave foley , who really tries , despite it all ) , the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion , and people taking a poo . it 's supposed to be satire , but i 'm not sure of what . think `` airplane ! `` , but done by the creators of south park , and without any jokes .

although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style , gabriele muccino 's project is rather mediocre . the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end : hearts human and emotional , eyes physical and metaphorical . seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of alejandro gonzález iñárritu 's amores perros and 21 grams , with lots and lots of flashbacks . the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie . that 's too bad , because seven pounds could have been as authentically `` good '' if ben and emily had been put in the right hands .
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life : one as a `` happily '' married man with a ten year oldish child , the other as a sex fiend . the bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist , listening to his story and intelligently probing him . nastassja 's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes . if she had , i would have rated this movie a big fat `` f. '' as it is , it rates an f+ , implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored . it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage . `` diary of a sex addict '' falls into the category of films that once one has seen it , one wishes that one had n't .
this movie has beautiful scenery . unfortunately it has no plot . in order to have a plot there must be a conflict . this movie had none . it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it . the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling . if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just do n't expect a story . there is n't one .
split second might have been a good movie . a story about a `` road rage '' homicide , has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance ; but ... but .... unfortunately , the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera-work and truly awful editing . the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt ( i suppose ) to reflect owen 's stress from business , family , and traffic . what this actually does is to give the viewer a headache . since the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie , but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography , one ought not waste time on this travesty .
! ! ! ! ! of course there 's spoilers ! ! ! ! ! i 'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies : female protagonist - check bad things happen to drug takers - check heorine knocks out villain - check heroine does n't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . in fact there 's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he 's been killing people on the underground . i 'm led to believe it 's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it 's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they 'd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there 's always a market for horror movies . likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it 's slightly better than 1972 's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground . it 's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
take a scifi original movie and mix in a little alternative/revisionist history , and you get `` aztec rex . '' apparently hernand cortes , before conquering the aztec empire , had to first conquer a tyrannosaurus rex and her mate . that 's the thrust of this movie . given the plot it could have really sucked ; the fact that it only kind of sucked is a tip of the cap to the writers . there are a few problems . for starters , cortes is played by ian ziering . even with a black wig , ziering as cortes is about as convincing as axl rose playing gandhi . and though cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of mexico , the aztecs here seem to be played by an all-hawaiian ensemble . casting aside , the t-rex ( es ) look reasonably good , though every time one of them gets shot it just oozed cgi . and they die too easily ; i suppose if a t-rex were around in real life they probably could be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary , 16th-century weaponry . but it takes something away from the movie . there are also some graphic t-rex-swallowing-human scenes , which is surprising , but in this context i thought they worked ok . there 's plenty of action , and the whole colonization angle is prevalent throughout but does n't overwhelm the dinosaur angle , unlike the other recent scifi original dinosaur movie `` warbirds . '' overall , a mediocre ( but decent by scifi original standards ) movie that rates a modest 4 .
there was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she 's always wanted after the worst life possible , beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with eric roberts . but her background makes it impossible for her to trust dean cain and this utterly destroys it in the end . it sounds weird , but i like the position dean cain was in at the end and the choice he made . he ca n't hurt her because he loves her and she 's the mother of his child ( i think the time frame makes it clear it 's his child and not his brother 's ) , but at the same he ca n't forgive her for all she 's done , sleeping with his brother ( which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way ) and then being part of his death . in better hands this would have been a better movie , but for something i caught on late night cable , it 's not bad .
the original show was so much better . they should have left on a good note . this movie killed the whole idea . it was boring , over-dramatic , and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack . this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious , and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel . not to mention , that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again . so , sorry , tyler perry , but try harder next time . this movie is just kinda dull , and not that funny either . sorry . 4/10 stars is it . jay addison
what of domino did i hate over everything , and i mean everything , else ? perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter ; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character ; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy lui ; who deserves a lot better than this junk ; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light can not directly hit with the same dumb look on her face . maybe it 's the editing ; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they 're uttered by people like kiera knightly who , if you buy as a bounty hunter , then you 'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012 . nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility , absolutely nobody at all . it is a painful and misguided experience , taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them . the principal question is : 'was domino supposed to be some kind of comedy ? ' what with its hilariously bad lead uttering certain lines that desperately want us to think she 's coming across as 'tough ' but really , she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school , attempting to impress her peers . there are things you genuinely do n't know how to react to , whether they 're supposed to be funny or not . if it is supposed to be a comedy , that begs the next question : 'is the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth exploiting for laughs ? ' i do n't think so . the film opens with the title card 'based on a true story ........ sort of . ' if that 's supposed to be some sort of post-modernist technique that enables director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose , then you 're simply on another planet . truth is , in that one opening quote the film identifies the subject matter and the original text before completely copping out and saying 'sort of ' which i guess is supposed to enable them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer . following this , we learn of domino 's relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something ; here is the first use of the 'sort of ' cop out as in real life she was just four . but if the film had gone by reality 's dates then her entire drive would 've been born out of the death of ........ her goldfish . we are then thrust into action with ed mosbey ( rourke ) ; domino ( knightley ) herself and would-be love interest choco ( ramírez ) . during the scene , an american mother is pinned down via gunfire in her own caravan in the back end of nowhere as she pleads for her son 's life to be spared . what a really misguided opening ; presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers , fire off weapons at innocents we do n't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs . the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads , a feeling of 'no , why are you doing this ? why is this happening ? ' bad seeds are planted and , would n't you know it , they stick . the film is painful to watch , excruciating even ; as these three mug their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills 90210 . here is another daft post-modernist slant , people playing themselves and that 'sort of ' joker card being played again . christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that reeks of robert downey jr 's natural born killers character . so as the film plods on and domino is cast into ed and choco 's gang , purely for her good looks i might add , it appears amidst the plot to do with fake driver 's registration i.ds or something that choco and domino may have feelings for one another . the problem is , as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character ; there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two ; the film is n't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place ? does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up ? if there is any 'feeling ' between choco and domino , it exists on such a small , tiny , minimalist scale that you have to ask why it 's even included . so then the film feels the need to crank things up narrative-wise . we find out the reason for the fake i.ds that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble . the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming flooded ? he must 've swam really quickly  double the speed of the film 's fasted edit which means something in the region of .01 of a second . yeah , sure . the film 's story becomes both too complicated and just plain arbitrary before resorting to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up . plus , there 's a really distasteful scene to do with a wall chart full of new ethnicities and the film 's comedy runs so dry , that it has to resort to the `` jerry , jerry ! '' chant whilst people are on a popular american talk show . when did we last laugh at `` jerry ! jerry ! '' ? when we were , say , seven years old ? i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film 's existence .
do not watch this sad excuse for a film . i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p * * sed off about it . the acting is comparable with high school plays . the script is shocking . there is no plot . twenty minutes from the end ( which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching ) i had a headache from all the screaming , crying and wailing the five girls make . the majority of the violence is ( rare for a film nowadays ) suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them , and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s * * t , die in the most horrible ways possible . i spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours . do n't do it .
the hysterical thing about this movie is that , according to the director , it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u.s. because most of them that viewed it could n't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of christianity and american angst . the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable . because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone `` godspeed '' this makes it a `` christian '' movie ? one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the `` land of plenty '' with all of its material excess , the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse . plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe ? plenty of useless homeless missions ? how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets ? as a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent `` pink '' are we to think america is a `` land of plenty '' of paranoid patriots ? maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients ? certainly we do n't have plenty of people concerned about palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film . of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the `` continent of plenty '' when it comes to sophistication . indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the `` land of plenty '' and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts , amateur acting and dispassionately directed films . life is too short and one , even an american , does n't have `` plenty '' of time to waste watching this piece .
-- -what happened to these unlikeable people . alan arkin was , as usual , unfunny and just walks through the role . the kids are all a mess . mariesa tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way . and what are carl reiner and rita moreno doing in this really bad , mean movie ? if you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction , and not try in any way to do better , this is your film . all others , take a walk , read a book , or see something else . jane
i waited for this movie to play in great anticipation . assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie , `` the christmas box '' based on the book by richard paul evans . i sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show , hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my `` new '' life . after seeing this movie i was so disappointed . as a mother who lost her only child in november 2003 and really knowing the pain , i had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who `` think '' they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child . this movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of diane keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child . it was very unrealistic from start to stop . i had a few calls after the movie , each call the same , `` that was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back '' what a bunch of bull ! it is clear that the director and keaton have never lost a child because neither would have ever made the movie to be so off the mark . i guess that 's hollywood .
it surprisingly had a plot ! ; ) i 've seen movies with less plot ( i do n't wan na mention asian movies but ... ) . i thought the camera was n't bad at all for a cheap movie like this , and also the atmosphere was n't too bad . there is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens . although i do think that about a lot of movies , in this case it was horrible , of course . it ripped off some movies so badly just for single scenes . the acting was bad but i 've seen worse . the movie was bad but i 've seen worse . watching this film is an experience between boredom , laughing fits , death wish , sadism , horniness and entertainment on a low level . so if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you . i gave it 3/10 , because it can be entertaining if you do n't expect to see a good movie and you 're in the right mood .
despite its flaws , i enjoyed `` cigarette burns '' , john carpenter 's season one episode in the masters of horror series . yes , the story seemed like a cheap cross between in the mouth of madness and 8mm , but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it . with `` pro-life '' , however , the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else . there is solid directing as always from carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush . the script is n't always clear , the message fuzzy , and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them . maybe had carpenter re-written the script , it could have been a worthwhile episode . instead , it 's a mess that only hardcore carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in . definitely the worst carpenter has ever done . 2/10
kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing , despite reviews . i have always found ms. ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles , and kevin kline is almost always worth watching . i say `` nearly '' and `` almost '' in large part because of this movie . first off , meg ryan does not play a likeable character , she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and does n't give up until several days later . that said , kevin kline 's character is even more annoying and less likeable . so , even if you normally like these two actors , i recommend your give this movie a pass .
how sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be . as soon as a few critics say something new is good ( ie - `` shake-cam '' ) , everyone jumps on the bandwagon , as if they are devoid of independent thought . this was not a good movie , it was a dreadful movie . 1 ) plot ? - what plot ? bourne was chased from here to there , from beginning to end . that 's the plot . do n't look for anything deeper than this . 2 ) cinematography ? - do me a favor ! any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job ( i am not exaggerating here ) . this film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work . the ridiculous shaking of every ( i really do mean every ) scene will cause dizziness and nausea . 3 ) believable ? - oh yes definitely . this is a masterpiece of credibility . i loved scenes about bourne being chased by ( local ) police through the winding market streets of tangier . - i 've been to tangier . even the guides ca n't navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse . greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples . 4 ) editing ? - i do n't know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some ! - every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds . i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the `` scenes '' flashing by . 5 ) directing ? - hmmm . this is an interesting aspect . the film appears to have actually not had any directing . more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script ( all two pages ) at the cameramen and told to `` shoot a few scenes whilst drunk '' . - `` do n't worry boys , we 'll tie the scenes together in the editing room '' . the editor should be tarred , feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 ) not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne . - putting their lives on the line for someone they could n't even be sure was n't a traitor . talk about stupid nincompoops . ( whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor ) . ( well , all men are evil , are n't they ? - except for snags of course ) . yes , this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity . 7 ) when the you-know-what finally hits the fan , good triumphs over evil ( just like it always does , eh ? ) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger ( yeah - right ... ) - at that very moment , the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger . - how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath ? wonders will never cease 8 ) do n't worry , there 's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts . well , we ca n't have nasty , politically incorrect , cia operatives going round shooting people , can we ? how lovely to see a true to life p.c . film of the noughties . -- -- -- -- -- -- -the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish .
an interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . there are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . all up the movie is enjoyable . the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . perkins plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he swang that spade awfully hard .
this movie is n't worth the film it was photographed on . the dialog is flat , filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time . the choppy , shaky , film style is a cheap imitation of the `` the ring '' style visual effects . the characters do not even act like a normal person would . for example , the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door , creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she does n't even once call out her sister 's name to see if she is home . what ? you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her . way too many flashbacks to her childhood . too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director . it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street , up the driveway , around this corner , over here , over there , oh a side view , now a front view . enough already . you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the solaris ! terrible movie . 0 out of 100 . i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it .
the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing `` guess '' that location . what toronto landmark will stand in for what american/international location . who knew that the anti-christ would be russian ? obviously he ca n't be american since we need the yanks to save the day - oh buck ... you 'll tell us all the truth ... you 'll show us the light ... and the way outta the building should those nasty anti-christers get their way . five golden raspberries . faith is not enough to hope they do n't make another of this ilk ! we do n't got ta prayer .
when the remake of when a stranger calls was out , obviously i was interested in watching the original . then when i read about the original ( which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day ) i saw that the real money is on black christmas , which apparently beat everyone to the `` the caller is in the house '' punch . so i netflix that , and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its `` very long wait . '' all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it ! then one day , out of the blue , it finally arrives ! ... and it 's a total snore . sure , maybe i had elevated expectations , but i do n't think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh . the thing is it 's christmas in some canadian college town , and there 's this sorority having a party . we see some killer-pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic . so we know he 's in the house . then we 're introduced to our characters-olivia hussey as the mousy , whiny , canadian-accented jess . margot kidder as the annoying , overtly aggressive alcoholic barb . she 's so annoying even her mother dis-invites her for her christmas festivities . there 's also this irritating janis ian clone ( `` phil '' ) and this alcoholic den mother mrs. mac , seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house . we also meet jess 's highly-strung boyfriend peter , played by keir dullea of 2001 and bunny lake is missing fame , though halfway through the film i was still asking myself `` which one 's keir dullea ? '' so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls , but this was before email , so they could n't ask him to send a photo . then-well , you know how they say those plastic dry-cleaning bags are not a toy ? one of the sisters finds that out the hard way . do n't worry if you do n't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic-encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic-there 'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film , obviously there to make you say `` oh my god ! there 's a corpse in the attic ! '' though after the first hour that changes to : `` how come the dumb police have n't found the rather prominently-placed plastic-encased corpse in the attic ? '' especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house . really , any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime ; the cops are so dumb . fortunately some of them look like john saxon . anyway , after a lot more darn boring human drama , the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy-looking trap door that rests atop it ( those wily cats ! ) , for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble . now we have two corpses up in the attic-hey , why do n't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic ? so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously , and tap the houses ' phone and station a cop outside . they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back , they need to keep him on the phone . jessica , who has grown even more whiny , mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller `` who is this ? what do you want ? who are you ? '' after like the first 89 calls , when it is clear that he is not going to answer her . is n't that like a sign a developmental disability ? the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something ? and what 's he going to do , suddenly say `` oh yeah , hi , it 's bob from the laundromat ? '' dumb jess . spoilers ! anyway , soon janis ian and lois lane ( kidder ) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces ( this film 's idea of gore ) , and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked . hello ? are you being stalked or what ? then the cops realize that the killer is in the house , and call jess and tell her `` do n't ask questions , just do as i say walk to the front door and get out . '' so what does moron jess do ? starts screaming `` phil ? barb ? phil ? barb ? '' hey , great idea sister . now why do n't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking ? of course she does , and sees her former friends , all splashed with ketchup , prompting this viewer to scream at the screen : `` have a clue now ? ! '' now , obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place , and that it does n't move to the same pace we 're used to , and seeing a plastic-covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably was scary back in the day , and people were n't used to being stalked by psychopaths , so they would n't think to , you know , lock the doors or windows . and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there . you see , people were stupid back in the 70s . we have to understand that . one of the big shocks is that we do n't even see our proto-final girl kill the psycho . but believe me , that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for . spoilers end ! -- -- -- hey , check out cinema de merde , my website on bad and cheesy movies ( with a few good movies thrown in ) . you can find the url in my email address above .
using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video ( except for the stolen footage ) concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that is ... do n't wait for it , is really earth . its a five minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes . slightly better than chickboxer ( another in the bad movie police series ) -having a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects , this movie is still an impossible slog to get through . i 'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we 're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage ? clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie . cheap looking , and worst of all , boring action scenes ! the only decent thing about the movie is the last fight sequence . only 82 minutes , but it feels like it goes on forever ! even die-hard van damme fans ( like myself ) should avoid this one !
i love john saxon in anything he 's in . the one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled `` please do not watch this movie called : zombie death house '' . the $ 1000 dollar shock insurance certificate is dear fred olen ray 's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70 's cheese legend . ray being the front man at retromedia . ray by the way makes charles band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a ford falcon . just plain bad now , the both of them- and boring besides . it 's great that ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it 's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of zombie death house- ( the word `` zombie '' sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of f.o.r . ) the only way to do service to this tripe is to release it on the dollar market for the curious collector and fans of saxon ! ! ! if you wan na see real saxon , pick up black christmas , nightmare on elm street or the glove .
this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it , they might wake up and do something about it . over the last few months , abc family began airing a new format of movies . i have seen the last three and enjoyed them . they were engaging and did the trick . my wife likes these films . i was looking forward to viewing `` see jane date '' . the trailers looked and sounded great . unfortunately , this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project . the year is 2003 , the source ( all bad ) , the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store . it was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film at all . it worked against it . i work in the business of film and television . i enjoy being entertained . this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse . the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you would n't know it from this movie . to add to the overall experience , the end left me shaking my head . an advice to the executives at disney , abc , abc family and the producers : under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films . they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word `` contemporary '' , `` present day '' and `` current '' means when describing a romantic comedy . there is a world passing you by . all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von zerneck-sertner and abc family .
here 's how you do it : believe in god and repent for your sins . then things should turn around within the next day or so . until the last fifteen minutes , this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk 's crappy life . his mom dies . his stepmom 's a b_tch . his dad dies . he drinks . he gets married . he has kids . he drinks some more . his wife gets mad . he disappoints his kids . the wife threatens to leave . he calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself . then after the recap happens , that 's when we get the `` left behind '' -like subtle message . `` he needed a paycheck '' . this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i would n't lose my respect for madsen . madsen drops to his knees and begs christ 's forgiveness . once he does , he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way . he tells his wife that he 's found god and that 's good enough for her . flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church . end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol . final moment ? he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ( i.e . sin house ) and give a gay , miami-vice , after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames . see why i had to repeat the phrase ? `` he needed a paycheck '' . man this movie is bad . the b-grade 80 's production values do n't help much . the script could have easily been a `` touched by an angel '' episode . it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials . the acting is wooden and never believable . even madsen , of whom i 'm a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this , makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he does n't know his a $ $ from his elbow yet on camera . 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged . this thing was like homework . i just wanted to put it away and say that alright , i saw half of it . that 's good enough . but no . if i sat through cheerleader ninjas , i could sit throughout this . the only reason i 'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points : 1 ) i love madsen . i know it 's not fair . but it 's great seeing the opening title `` introducing michael madsen '' . sue me . 2 ) some of the dialogue is so bad that it 's classic . i 'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too . that 's about it . to wrap it up , this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds . but hey ! look ! michael madsen ! ( see also tilt , executive target , my boss 's daughter , etc ) . now i 've got ta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him . see ya , kids . `` this stuff 's gon na make me go blind , but i 'm gon na drink it anyway '' - madsen 's first taste of cheap alcohol `` i do n't understand ! everything seems so beautiful ! '' - madsen walking outside after confessing to god `` i 'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and i 'm gon na get a haircut too '' - madsen after converting at the dinner table , because satan lives in your hair
i do n't understand why making remakes has become the trend . every remake i have ever seen is awful , and this is no exception . if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones , that it is a `` sleazy '' piece of trash , he is quite right . why they would take a wonderful television show , which i loved , have never missed an episode , and own seasons 1-4 on dvd , and ruin it , i 'll never know . the television show was a family show , and although daisy has the body , it was really flaunted , or even addressed in the show , save the outfits . a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage , and i would n't recommend anyone go see it . another thing i did n't like was that john schneider and tom wopat are excellent actors ( along with the rest of the original cast ) , and they are also extremely cute . the new bo and luke are not even a little cute . that was one of the drawers for the show . the casting is terrible . they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy . i do n't think burt reynolds is a qualified boss hogg , either . every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role . the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse , but still it is no comparison . denver pyle is an actor all his own , and that made him perfect for the role . i think that the casting is awful , the story is awful , and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty , terrible movie . i would n't recommend anyone go see it . i only saw it out of curiosity , plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd . i would never have paid to see this movie , but it was free . do n't pay to see this movie .
whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point . jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy . this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles . there is not one decent performance in it .. even the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully unfunny . the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon . maud adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing . all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable.she is not . kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better . i 've flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet . avoid
wow ... what can i say ... first off imdb says this is in the late 60s ... which means carlito would be very close to going to prison , he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years . they used a bunch of nobody actors , and a story that did n't even make sense . they bring back only one actor , guzman , and hes playing a totally different guy . why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick ? wheres gale ? he said he was in love with her before . wheres kleinfeld ? he said he knew him forever ... you 'd think he 'd have been in this one . and if this made sense , where are rocco and the black dude in the first one ? it was all just stupid ... this is an insult to pacino and the first film .
a friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find , and i have a good laugh watching them with him . i have told him if he puts this one on again i will be forced to give him a good kicking . he knows i am serious !
one would think ( as i did ) , that with steve martin , goldie hawn , and john cleese , a movie should be , at the very least , decent . these stars ( especially martin and cleese ) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time . well , apparently i was grossly mistaken -- this is single-handedly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny . it pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts i have had the misfortune to come across . based solely on the big names , i remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film , but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever . normally , both with movies and in life , i try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations . but with this film , it 's hard not to let loose . i can count on one hand , perhaps even two or three fingers , major hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this . this is easily one of the worst comedies ever made . i tried to enjoy this -- -i really did . but the out-of-towners ultimately fails miserably . if you really want time-efficient entertainment , just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet . just please do n't watch this movie .
disowned by richard c. sarafian , this disaster stunk up japanese theaters before coming to the states and going immediately to video , where it was not seen again until the turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin . the smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it . but i 'm afraid that sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one . the actors , mostly recent graduates of `` overacting 101 '' , deliver one cornball line after another . the plot is convoluted . the special effects are unimpressive . the parts that are n't laughable are just plain boring . the script or the book must have been good - why else would palance , matheson , boyle , or heston agree to appear in this dud ? but something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen . summary : avoid . not even bad enough to be so-bad-it's-good .
this is an attempt , by both author edgar rice burroughs and filmmakers , at an arabian `` tarzan of the apes '' . but , this desert-set film shows none of the majesty present in burroughs ' more successful jungle adventure . the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall ( as `` el 'lion '' chatham ) and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke ( as `` princess '' eulilah ) , with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge . the opening states that , although guilty of conduct unbecoming , the lad 's mother is living - but , she never re-enters the picture . unfortunately , `` the lion man '' has deteriorated , and is looks like it 's missing footage . * * * the lion man ( 1936 ) john p. mccarthy ~ jon hall , kathleen burke , ted adams
i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play . i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances . i mean with the star power of eddie murphy , jamie foxx , beyonce knowles , danny glover ... the movie could n't be less than 4 out of 4 stars , right ? wrong ! i was definitely disappointed by the finished product . the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy , anika noni rose and jennifer hudson . eddie murphy 's james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudson 's performance compels you to pay attention each time she 's on screen . her performance of `` and i am telling you '' was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved . you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life . as many reviewers have stated , she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she 's receiving for this performance . anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent . jamie foxx and beyonce knowles , on the other hand , cruised through their performances . foxx 's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary `` ray '' performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping , posing and shimmying her way through the movie . her performance was n't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film . the movie was too hyped , 30 minutes and 1 song ( beyonce 's `` heartfelt '' solo to jamie foxx ) too long . dh -- vancouver , wa
i was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the apollo 11 mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission , linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of tv production . if you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could 've been great - but i feel i 've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme . i want those minutes back .
this is the last time i rent a video without checking in at the imdb reviews . the limey is directed by steven soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful nightwatch with ewan macgregor and directed such trash as out of sight with the anti-talented jennifer lopez . terence stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film . there is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story , filming and just plain common sense . this film does everything wrong . what were they thinking ?
nut case is murdering college students , can new teacher stop the madness ? ! believe me , you wo n't care . with a title like splatter university , one would immediately gather that this movie just is n't high art . but worse than that splatter university does n't even qualify for amusing garbage . splatter u is so poorly made - the story is mindless , the characters are throw-aways , and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination . needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares . this drivel is n't even brave enough to throw in any nudity ( for the cheapest thrill of all ) . so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment ( not even cheap laughs ) and just becomes a complete bore . bottom of the barrel folks - even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing , let alone paying money for this flick . bomb out of * * * *
i 'll have to add dissenting comment here . various reviews i have read compared this movie to the likes of those by wong kar wai or hou hsiao-hsien . i.e . one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years . unfortunately this is n't quite accurate . the film plays out rather like a film school graduate 's attempt to emulate these masters . all the pieces are there - the beautiful backdrop , the vaguely minimalist dialogue , the slow swaying camerawork , and male leads , in particular , who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative . sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par . the dialogue is leaden . the acting is generally unable to lift the characters above type ; the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving . unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical `` chekovian '' ( i.e . very predictable ) plot , the results are at best tedious and at worst painful . i could n't help but see the `` blue danube '' river scene , for example , as verging on genre parody ( although the smoggy looking `` springtime '' sky over the river did provide a bit of black humour ... ) i actually went to this movie on the basis that mark li ping was photographing it . while the setting is elegant , and the swaying camera attempts to replicate the mood of `` flowers of shanghai '' , the film is not in the same league , visually . in fact i must confess that after an hour of wondering whether it was the script or the acting that was ruining the film , i suddenly remembered that i was meant to meet my flatmate for dinner and took the chance to leave ( and i ca n't recall the last film i walked out of ) . i 'm guessing from the reviews that the ending may have left a positive aftertaste but by that point i could n't care . if you 'd like to see something along similar lines done with real talent then i 'd recommend anything by the above two directors , for example `` in the mood for love '' or `` flowers of shanghai '' , both of which were filmed by the talented mr ping ( the former with chris doyle ) , and both of which are films masterful enough to inspire years of failed emulations like this . it 's not often mr hoberman leads me astray , and perhaps you 'd rather listen to him , but do n't say you were n't warned . craig .
the orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character 's simply do n't resonate or even react . two examples : a priest , walking through a graveyard late at night , is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits . after fighting them off , he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up . `` anything wrong ? '' his buddy asks , having seen the attack . `` just some demonic spirits-nothing i could n't handle . '' no reaction , no surprise , just like he 'd changed a tire . his buddy is equally unconcerned ... must be standard priest training ... [ `` and then you put the wafer into their mouths . any questions ? ok , moving on , demon spirit attacks ... '' ] example two : at one point the priests need an answer to a question , and only a demon ( or something , who cared by now ) could provide it . how ? why , you have to ask a dying man ! so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing , gasping man . `` hey , do n't kill him ! '' or maybe `` that 's not nice ! '' would have been more realistic then their response . they never ask that they let the man go or stop-in fact , the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance . they ask their question and go . i had to shut it off at that point-my brain was starting to atrophy . avoid * / * * * * ( one star out of four )
as the number of video nasties i 've yet to see dwindles , this little pile of garbage popped up on my `` to rent '' list when i saw it was available . the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots . some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip , though if he returns with the girl and all the money , he gets a significant cut . he 's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and , wow , that pilot is one of the worst actors ever ! granted , they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood . after stealing away into the jungle , we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour . now , this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever , ping-pong balls for eyes and that 's pretty much it . his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack , and i found myself muting much of those scenes . oh , did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity ? this is probably the main reason this film was banned , though there is one specific scene , about one second long , where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out , but it 's not a redeeming factor for gore fans . also , jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals , and , sadly , male as well . so , if you want `` fair '' in terms of exploitation , you got it . i ca n't recommend this trash to anyone . it 's not even the good bad movie . it 's just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then , if you are making your way through the list , leave this for the very last . if you watch it first , you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list , which is certainly not true .
... well , pop this into the dvd , waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never get back , and find out . acting ? what acting ? production values ? ... production ? ... values ? story ? do n't get me started . after many years of posting on imdb , i never thought i would see a film so bad that i truly wished for a lower rating than one . i always have found at least a reason or two to see merit - if only in the intent or the effort of the writer , the director , the cast , or the producer ? in this case , they 're all the same guy ( ! ) who really needs to get a handle on the fact , at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape , that he has no talent . i mean it would be a reasonable excuse if this were some junior high schooler 's `` production '' for his first cinema class , but the referenced `` artist '' behind this dreck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage . just how did this ever get made ? who in their right mind ever wrote a check for this ? moreover , do n't let the box cover fool you : there 's not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good `` exposure '' of the hunk on that cover . two final items : there was one second when this `` film '' had redeeming value : the aforementioned `` talent '' gets roundly punched out by his lover . i cheered ! and , i did learn one thing from this `` film. '' . there are times when something is so very bad that it is , indeed , truly very funny . but not in any comical manner ; it 's just sadly humorous . very sadly humorous .
we brought this film as a joke for a friend , and could of been our worst joke to play . the film is barely watchable , and the acting is dire . the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance . the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on . it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable . just terrible
dont let the mpaa fool you with their `` rated r for extreme violence '' there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s * t. i expected some cheap rambo 3 type action that the trailer promised , however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense . avoid !
one hour , eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame . that was right after hopalong ( chris lybbert ) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse . i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which did n't translate into anything at all . obviously , the name coppola in the credits could n't do anything to guarantee success here , even with more than one listed . if you make it to the end of the film , you 'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did . what exactly was the hook with the gloves ? what 's up with the rodeo scenario ? who was the stranger supposed to represent ? why did they make this film ? i could probably go on but my energy 's been drained . look , there 's already a western called `` the gunfighter '' from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character . watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad . that one i can recommend .
one-note comedy that probably sets modern day feminists ' teeth on edge . department store clerk betsy drake is in love with the idea of babies and marriage , pinning her hopes on women 's magazines until she spies super-bait in the form of sleek bachelor cary grant . the rest of the film plods from one ploy to the next as the relentless drake pursues her quarry . i guess the word `` perky '' just about sum 's up drake 's approach to the role . she does have a charming smile , but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures , i began to overdose . grant 's role is basically secondary and minus his usual flair . there is one scene , however , that almost salvages this slender exercise . drake queries the hapless grant following his lecture to a roomful of respectable ladies . here her perky manner has an unforced freshness that is really quite remarkable , and had the production not rubbed our noses in that upbeat grin for 90 minutes , the film might have amounted to more than a girls ' camp day-dream , circa 1948 .
this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did ( i think that laurel goes to `` the prisoner of zenda '' ) but it is surely the most depressing . sellers , especially sans makeup as nayland smith , looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy . as fu manchu , he looks hardly better and spends most of the film ( with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents ) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup . the supporting players also look tired and run down , and sid caeser 's presence is offensive even without his constant references to `` chinks ! '' ( one bright spot : this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray asians so insultingly ... or , for that matter , star a non-asian as one ! ) . the film seems surprisingly cheap , with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz-bang elvis number at the end looks cut-rate . only the stunning helen mirren and the tall , thin , nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair . all in all , this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic 's death , and an even eerier documentation of his dying .
this movie sucks . ridiculous `` school '' athmosphere , unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the `` good teacher '' nick nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as kittens . if this works for you , it does n't for me . 0 out of 10
there was nothing of value in the original movie , this one was even lamer . the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing . anyone connected to this film has to be high on something ! so what was the story line ? what was with the girl ? was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film . sadly , i tried several times to watch this . i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback . kid said it was stupid , and he was four years old . i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director , as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film . that might be pushing it . i did love the theme song . good thing it was only a dollar , it was worth it . i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be . is pot legal in france ?
drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth . i loved segal 's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him . i just saw this movie ( ok , fell asleep about 90 % through , so i did n't see the end ) . when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu , i was thankful i did n't subject myself to any more of that movie and did n't dare find out what happened at the end . there was something strange about the voice of segal and others . kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed , but in the same language ( australlian is english , right ? : ) anyway , if i had 10 thumbs , they 'd all point down right now for this segal injustice .
extremely dull drama starring a very young roddy mcdowall , who trains a wild horse , the flicka of the title , and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place . coated in blaring , overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue , this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache . the naffly-titled sequel , 'thunderhead , son of flicka ' , in which mcdowall trains the next generation of nag , is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission , although there are at least one or two scenes that do n't induce a coma .
given the chance to write , direct and star in my own movie , i would probably choose something about robot women with guns . anthony hopkins , however , decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen . `` slipstream '' is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say 'what 's going on ? ' . this is a movie where , in one scene , a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left . this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls . this is a movie where a man starts talking about `` invasion of the bodysnatchers '' only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself ( and then disappear into thin air ) . this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so , as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all . i must , however , commend mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie ( some of whom portray multiple characters ) . all of those involved throw themselves into their roles , even if they probably have no idea what they 're actually doing . my favourite here was christian slater 's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the american national anthem . anthony hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that 's possibly the best way to sum up `` slipstream '' . it 's a joke on the audience . you 'll watch it from beginning to end , trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come , only to discover that the answer never actually does . what the punchline to this particular joke is , only anthony hopkins will ever know . i mentioned david lynch earlier and i 'm a big fan of that particular director . i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of `` twin peaks '' , `` blue velvet '' and `` lost highway '' . however , `` slipstream '' is n't as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques ( although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in `` slipstream '' ) . it 's far too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out , it 's the movie version of alzheimer 's disease . no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it . unfortunately for the rest of us , `` slipstream '' quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to hopkins ' involvement . watch at your own risk .
i do not know who is to blame , miss leigh or her director , but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch . ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job - against all odds as far as i am concerned . his character is entirely too charming and appealing . but certainly not shown as greedy enough , to put up with leigh 's character 's silliness . chaplin appears bemused by what can not possibly be understood as leigh 's shyness and lack of grace , but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness . there has to be some element of believability to his interest , but as played it is incomprehensible . the performances do not jibe . maggie smith and albert finney are , of course , wonderful despite any effort to derail them . the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch . what a pity , too , the leads do n't work together because the production is lovely to look at .
this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood . the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business . the idea that audiences paid to see this movie ( and like an idiot i rented the film ) is discouraging also . obsessed teacher ( 3 years prior ) kills teenager 's family because he wants her . for no reason he kills the mother , father and brother . from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction . years later , obsessed teacher breaks out of prison . hmm -- usual bad writing -- no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute . obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around , sniff out people and with a knife is super killer . sure ! ! ! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason , knifes bellhop for the fun of it , and starts to hunt down the teenager 's friends . now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you . obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel -- -again it is stupid , ever cop would know his face -- but he walks right by them . now he kills two cops outside teenager 's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend . there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage . if any other profession put out work of this low quality , they would be fired . yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash .
i mean really . this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind . okay , if you 're a stoner and have nothing better to do , then maybe . i think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have , and this is not the vehicle for it . come on now , this film is just tacky .
i saw this movie on the film festival of rotterdam ( jan '06 ) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards . many people reacted shocked and protesting . he will get a lot of negative critics . but : the world is cruel like this , and it 's not funny . people do n't like it . that itself does n't mean that the movie is bad . i can see that difference . do n't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble ' ! nevertheless i think this a bad movie . film-technically it 's a good one . nice shots and script , most good fitting music , great actors . the director pretends to make a psychological movie , - the psychology however is of poor quality . describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art . the art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence . how does a shy boy come to such a cruelty ? the director pretends to describe that , - but is not good in that . the director used several times the word the 'selfishness ' of people , mentioning for instance the teacher . only : this teacher was n't selfish , - just someone in several roles , caring for his pupils , ánd worried about his script . i think it 's a simplification to call him selfish . the atmosphere in the village is creepy , and the mother made awful mistakes ( 'you terribly let me down ' ) but it does n't become believable for me , that there is caused súch a lot of pain , that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things . in fact , reality is far more complex than the way , this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions . the interesting thing would be : how does it work ? describe that process for me please , so that we understand . with the written phrase on the end , the director said to point to an alternative way of life . it was the other extreme , and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists , promoting black/white-thinking . the connection between violence in films and in society has been proved . use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right . there are enough black/white-thinkers in the world , causing lots of war and misery . i hope , this movie wo n't be successful .
strictly a routine , by-the-numbers western ( directed by genre-mainstay andrew v. mclaglen , so is that any wonder ? ) . army colonel brian keith spars with smarmy bandit dean martin , who has just kidnapped the colonel 's wife ( honor blackman , who never found her niche after playing pussy galore in `` goldfinger '' ) . fist-fights , shoot-outs , stagecoach robberies and denver pyle in a supporting role ... in other words , absolutely nothing new or original . talking in a low monotone throughout , keith gets to dally with a prostitute ( something of a shock after his run on tv 's `` family affair '' ) , but otherwise this low-rent material wastes keith 's amiable talents . it 's also bad news for dino , who does n't seem to notice or care . hack direction , poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor . * from * * * *
holy crap . this was the worst film i have seen in a long time . all the performances are fine , but there is no plot . really ! no plot ! a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that 's your film . ug ... robert duvall 's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over . this earns him the same responses over and over . i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it . good performances with famous and well regarded actors , but the actual complete work is a steamy turd . well , maybe that 's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens ! sack
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable , but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it . keeping his great 30 days tv series in mind but also counting in his mtv production `` i bet you will '' that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production `` supersize me '' i did not had my hopes up high . sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less . as with `` supersize me '' after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was . the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re-repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie , so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end .
i 'm sorry , i had high hopes for this movie . unfortunately , it was too long , too thin and too weak to hold my attention . when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream , i felt cheated . surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper , something more meaningful . so , do n't buy a large drink or you 'll be running to the rest room . my kids did n't enjoy it either . ah well .
or listening to , for that matter . even the soundtrack is a bore . honestly , this is n't the worst gay movie i 've seen ( that would be regarding billy ) , but it 's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel . this thing drags and drags and drags . it 's not that the plot is inane -- in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining . there 's not one plot point you ca n't see coming for ten miles down the road . the dialog is flat . the jokes are old . to add insult to injury , it 's full of one-dimensional , stereotypical gays . nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible , much less real . there was no chemistry , no dynamic , in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we 're just told they 're in love . hard to figure when they have nothing in common and are n't compatible sexually . they like the same book ? huh ? the acting is not totally bad , but the pacing is excruciatingly slow . i mean , almost jarmusch- slow , but without jarmusch quality . in fact , that would be a good barometer for you . if you like jarmusch films , avoid this one .
going into a movie like i this , i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills ..... what i got was even less . christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit . horrified , he runs up the stairs and cuts himself . the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe ..... cept for the fact he 's obsessed with santa . after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane , dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss . an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they 're about to torch him , he drives his van off a cliff ..... into the moon . not the best ending i 've seen but it was original . it was a slow paced , boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers . there was hardly any gore and even the `` sex '' scenes were toned down . too boring ...... 4 out of 10
after the success of scooby-doo , where are you , they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show . but unfortunately , they added a new character that spoilt scooby-doo success forever . they invented a new show with a new title , scooby and scrappy-doo . it was scrappy-doo that made this show a complete failure , probably for both adults and kids together . scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain , and they were also trying to stop him . scooby-doo does n't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . if they wanted scooby-doo to be more successful , they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy . this was just poor , maybe your kids will prefer it !
well , what can you say about sitcoms . there often quite lame , morale dedicative , and just plain . so is this show ! it got a boring cast , although a.bynes is okej in her perky way , the rest is just stereotypical crap .... as always . we have all seen it before , and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled . cause , lets face it , its a mediocre and self righteous show . as the most sitcoms are .... well , in short . if you wan na see some good entertainment , you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror . do some faces and move on .... its more entertaining than this show !
cheesy script , cheesy one-liners . timothy hutton 's performance a `` little '' over the top . david duchovny still seemed to be stuck in his fox mulder mode . no chemistry with his large-lipped female co-star.he needs gillian anderson to shine . he does not seem to have any talent of his own .
waitress : honey , here 's them eggs you ordered . honey , like bee , get it ? that 's called pointless foreshadowing . edward basket : huh ?

( courageously kicks her in the face . her eyes roll back in her head and become cartoon xs . ) voluptuous wench : snore ( at the nicolas cage roast ) ellen burstyn : and who can forget the part where basket 's cell phone rings in the middle of his bear suit scene and then the call gets dropped . it 's like a wireless ad : help me ! can you hear me now ? hahaha . kate beahan : and remember when i produced the bullets i jacked from basket 's gun ? he looked so surprised . you should be more careful with your belongings , nick . hahaha . and your movie choices . all : the drone must die ! basket : ( screaming ) oh , yeah , you bitches ? well , roasting me is n't gon na help your goddamn honey ! aaah . my legs ! honey , ( honey , get it ? ) put down that torch and step away from the basket case . honey ! smokey bear says do n't play with matches . hahaha . what the ? look out for that hurtling semi-truck ! ahh ! oh . goddammit , these flashbacks from my drug experimentation phase in the seventies are getting old ! where 's my heroin ? ouch . ouch . my watch is n't fireproof . ouch . i think something bad is about to happen . can you hear me now ? i 'm ready for my close up . goddammit ! ( six months later ) voluptuous wench in modern-day slutty attire : i told that eponymous basket case to take me with him . innocent young drone : i like to help people . volptuous wench : then get me out of my contract for the sequel ! i think something bad is about to happen . eeeee !
i ca n't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 . i could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons , but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that ? i was a huge fan the 1st season . i was hooked - all the mystery , suspense , unexplained events . you never knew what was going to happen next . by season 2 , i was still watching faithfully , but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained . and instead of giving you more answers , it just seemed like more questions . i love suspense , but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching . now , i ca n't even remember what finally turned me off , but somewhere in season 2 , i had enough . i 'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly ca n't miss an episode to stay up on what 's happening . so , it was no longer worth the effort to me . it 's a shame that they could n't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans . i agree with some of the posters that it appears abc just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out . do n't they realize that in the end , they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain .
the howling ii starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by christopher lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field , oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason . he says `` for it 's written the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with her blood . and i saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication 's and upon her forehead was written , behold i am the great mother of # an inaudible word i could n't make out no matter how many times i rewound the tape and tried to , sorry # and all abominations of the earth '' . this opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre . after the opening credits which are set over shots of transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we 're in 'los angeles , california u.s.a. city of the angels ' . i knew i was in for a long 86 minutes . it 's probably not too long after the events of the original howling ( 1981 ) and it 's karen white 's funeral . after the ceremony karen 's brother ben ( reb brown ) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator ' called stefan crosscoe ( christopher lee ) who says that karen is a werewolf and that she will come back to life . ben dismisses such nonsense . but together with one of karen 's friends and colleagues jenny ( annie mcenroe ) he visits stefan at his home . there stefan tells them about werewolves and how they can be killed , he mentions stirba ( sybil danning ) who is the queen of werewolves . stefan also shows them a photograph taken at karen 's funeral of a woman named mariana ( marsha a . hunt ) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous werewolf who wants karen . stefan says he will stake any werewoves through the heart with titanium . ben figures out that stefan means he will stake karen as well so together with jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister 's crypt is to stop stefan . however lots of werewolves turn up and attack stefan , ben and jenny . they survive the attack and manage to find out that stirba is to be found in transylvania . they all decide to travel to transylvania and stop stirba and her werewolves from taking over the earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse . once there they travel to a small town called vlkava which means 'where wolves live ' and meet up with the local priest , father florin ( ladislav krecmer ) and his small but loyal group of werewolf hunters , hey what else can i call them ? oh , and a dwarf named florica ( ludmila safarova ) helps too . they follow mariana who they hope will lead them to stirba . but stirba knows of stefan 's arrival and has plans for him ben and jenny . will stefan be able to put an end to stirba 's plans for world domination ? will this film get any more bizarre or surreal ? watch it and find out . directed by philippe mora this is one strange mess of a film . it 's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently . the single biggest problem is the script by robert sano and gary brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and does n't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like . luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring , unlike the original . something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained . most people will probably hate it , but for those of us who enjoy 'bad ' films this is right up there with the best of them . there are werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch . we get some cool werewolf killing weaponry . the sets and locations just seem so out of place and i do n't know if this was actually shot in transylvania but it does n't look like what i thought mid 80 's transylvania would . stirba 's castle is part dungeon , part gothic castle and part modern luxury house . stirba and her servant 's costumes are very over-the-top , stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a s/m video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy , and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too . the special make-up effects range from good to poor , a dwarf 's eyes explode , someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this is n't a film loaded with gore , although there are plenty of effect sequences with werewolf transformations and attacks . there is plenty of nudity as well as stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of werewolves ! i should also mention the music , the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that i hated and i ended up turning the volume down . acting is weak all round and what on earth was christopher lee thinking about when he accepted this film ? ! i wonder what he thinks of it . basically the whole thing is a real mess , but i found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same . impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end . speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage , it also features the same shot of sybil danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times ! if that 's your thing .
lynch . the man has some really great stuff ! he knows how to disturb us , then reward us by getting us think in different ways . this , however , is altogether different . dumbland 's reward is 1 % absurd comedy , earned by enduring 99 % stupidity . i may have laughed once , but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast-forward . did n't miss a thing . i felt relieved when it ended , and that 's part of the point with this series . it 's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations , rounded out with annoying animation , voices and sound . but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile .
my god , what 's going on ? a uwe boll film and positive comments ? wow ! nice to note that most of the positive reviews are coming from newbies to boll 's work . i myself , as i have stated in previous uwe boll reviews , only watch his films in the hope that one day he will actually make something good . i mean .. it must happen one day ! alas , seed is not that day . i do n't quite know where to start with the lame attempt at a horror film that seed is . the thing to remember people is that all the sickos in the world are that way due to having watched various sick acts on video or the net ..... or so mr boll believes . i still ca n't for the life of me figure out why footage of real animal abuse and killings was needed in the first 10 minutes of this film . i understand the concept that seed ( the killer ) is a sicko and enjoys watching such stuff ..... but ca n't understand why mr boll thought putting real footage in the film would work . maybe to shock us ? hmmm ..... well , i for one am not squeamish and can handle seeing anything on film . i do n't though , find the use of real animal cruelty footage entertaining in the slightest . if you were trying to shock me , it did n't work . it just reminded me how messed up the world was because such things happen and also because uwe boll is allowed to continue making films . this sort of context may have worked for films in the 70/80 's ( cannibal holocaust ) but not todays market . with that out of the way , we can move on to the fact that uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap feel all round like bloodrayne 2 . you can just tell that there was n't a huge amount of money floating around for production . as per usual , mr boll does not really care for making a decent story as we are treated to boring shots of police officers watching various videos of seed 's victims in the first 25 mins . each of these videos ends in a speeded up decomp of the victim . it 's all very boring and tedious . i wo n't comment on the toddler scene as it 's laughable and just another cheap 'shock ' factor . if you manage to sit through the first 25 mins then you will be treated to the police officers walking through a very dark house in order to catch seed . the lighting here is horrible and uwe has the old ' i 'm not using a steady cam ' fiasco that he did with bloodrayne 2 . watch as the police officers die in ever stupidly increasing ways until such point as seed is caught . this scene is soooo bloody stupid you have to see it to believe it . the cop actually tells seed he could have shot him . for some un-be-known reason , the cop does n't shoot him . given that seed is a sicko that kills kids as well as adults , you 'd have thought at this point in the script that sense would prevail . from here we are treated to a stupid execution scene , followed by the cops burying seed alive ( and they know he is alive .. why not shoot him in the head ? ? ? ? ) , followed by seed getting out of the ground and then killing some random woman with a hammer and then kidnapping the one of the cop 's family . what i 'm trying to get across to you all here is that it 's just plain stupid ! it 's not even hollywood horror stupid .... just plain dumb . uwe boll can not direct * * * * . anyone with any ounce of taste would agree with that statement . anyone who watches this film and found it entertaining in any way shape or form needs to take a serious look at themselves as a person . once again we are treated to a poorly acted , directed , lighted , produced , scripted piece of ub crap .
admirably odd , though mean-spirited comedy-drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the houston astrodome . robert altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight . some of the cinematography is evocative , shelley duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide , and sally kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as bud cort 's vision of a `` mother bird '' ( imagine altman and producer lou adler explaining that role to her ! ) . in the lead , bud cort is -- once again , after `` harold & maude '' -- a true original ; not off-putting like , say , michael j. pollard , cort manages to be geeky , wacky and inoffensive , a tough act to pull off . unfortunately , this is one of altman 's misfires . he can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else , but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward . * * from * * * *
i can not believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong . the plot was abysmal , the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful . not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess . however i can not lie , some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says `` i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f * * * * stereotypes `` please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh .. maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
all these reviewers are spot on . i 've seen many bad films over the years , believe me , and this beats the lot ! this is not just a `` so bad it 's good '' exploiter waste of time , but a genuine , hilarious , movie atrocity . check out the white furry monster type thing ! wet yourself laughing at thom christopher 's `` spell-weaving '' acting ! gape in sheer a * * e-clenching disbelief ! at the threadbare sets ! this is one of those `` european co-productions '' . no wonder we have so many wars . i swear , some of the people taking part in 'wizards of the lost kingdom ' are n't actually aware they are appearing in a film ! fact ! i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation . i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful . it is . worse even than lee majors in the norseman , more laughable than all of john derek 's films , this is , truly , the citizen kane of trash .
after seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago , i was curious to see the unedited version . i was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than i remembered , but one thing really stood out . i think other reviewers have mentioned this also , namely , what exactly is the nature and motivation of the chris sarandon character ? has he raped other victims before ? is he completely psychotic or an `` average '' sociopath ? how did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister ? is this character at all credible , or is it just a matter of more background being necessary ? he seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character , and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young , vulnerable girls . this seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general . it has nothing to do with his performance , which is terrifyingly convincing.the movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject , without quite settling into either mode . not the worst movie ever made , but not all that good , either .
the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour . remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in `` five the hard way '' . he 's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor . probably the most laughs you will have is with dr. beck 's epileptic seizures out of nowhere . could mrs. beck be anymore wooden ? seriously , if you took a 4 foot branch , stuck it in a hot tub , you would n't be able to notice a difference . the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll . watch it as a late night movie , mstified , but do n't go out of your way .
gillian anderson is an arrogant , driven , career woman who picks up working class oik danny dyer for a night of fun . after a stupid accident in the countryside , they are brutally attacked . after recovering , and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers , their thoughts turn to that of revenge ... i thought `` straightheads '' was terrible . violent , brutal , misogynistic and unpleasant . if i did n't dislike the phrase a great deal i would call `` straightheads '' a video nasty . certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 's . frankly i do n't know how `` straightheads '' got a cinema release . i am not a prude . i do n't mind sex and violence in the movies , but they have to be married to a movie with a ) a good plot or b ) good characterisation or c ) preferably both . `` straightheads '' had neither . no progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid . luckily `` straightheads '' went nowhere fast . it was only 80 minutes long . it was a shame , because there was the germ of an interesting film here , with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third . how often do i say this , but it could have been good if it had been done properly . what a shame . i really like gillian anderson and danny dyer , but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film . she , especially , is very underrated ( and is still particularly fit ) . if you want to see a good british revenge movie , rent or buy shane meadows ' `` dead man 's shoes '' . it is a little masterpiece . last weekend i should have seen his `` this is england '' instead . ce sera sera ...
so it starts with a beautiful old house in the country . you have a group of people who get asked to come to this house and ( not surprisingly ) the caretakers always lock the gates at night for no apparent reason . anywhoo , the people laugh , joke etc . this dr tells them a spooky story of this woman and some kids . they get scared , they start to feel stuff . oh no , a girl see 's s ghost . some more talking then this huge ghost comes and etc etc . this girl finds out that this ghost killed little kids and that she must free their souls , yeah yeah , blah blah . she does but , oh no , she dies as she does . and goes to heaven whilst this evil ghost goes to hell . two people survive and escape the house . the script is terrible because a guy gets his head chopped off and elanor ( the one who dies saving the kids ) says `` oh no '' . the acting is wooden , the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again . basically if you like laughing at badly made films watch it , but if your looking for a scare then definitely give this film a miss . i was extremely disappointed when i watched this . a very big let down . my sister ( who gets sacred very easily ) got bored in this film it is appalling .
a `` friend '' , clearly with no taste or class , suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins . if this is representative of his oeuvre , i never want to see anything else by him . it is amateurish , self-indulgent , criminally shoddy and self-indulgent rubbish . the `` whore mangler '' of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers . there is a little nudity and some erections , but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman 's noose . the lighting is appalling , the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted , and the direction is clueless . i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention . atkins was one of those featured . he spoke like there was something important about his work , but after a viewing of this , i see nothing of any import whatsoever . there is no style , either , and the horrible video effects ( like solarization ) only enhance the amateurishness . not even so bad it 's fun . avoid .
the film starts with a manager ( nicholas bell ) giving welcome investors ( robert carradine ) to primal park . a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna , like ¨jurassik park¨ , and some scientists resurrect one of nature 's most fearsome predators , the sabretooth tiger or smilodon . scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific.meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . in addition , a security agent ( stacy haiduk ) and her mate ( brian wimmer ) fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons . the sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature 's most fearsome predators . furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims . the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair-raising chills , full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects.the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food.actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . no for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following : ¨sabretooth ( 2002 ) ¨by james r hickox with vanessa angel , david keith and john rhys davies and the much better ¨10.000 bc ( 2006 ) ¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait , cliff curtis and camilla belle . this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . miller is an australian director usually working for television ( tidal wave , journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( the man from snowy river , zeus and roxanne , robinson crusoe ) . rating : below average , bottom of barrel .
this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence , in which brian flemming , perhaps purposely , fails to mention important evidence to the contrary . perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest : his claims concerning the invalidity of paul 's testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts , like : * * the existence of some formulated creeds within paul 's letters . these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ 's death and resurrection . * * the testimonies of the early christians ca n't just be tossed out as mere fantasy . there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period , but only one of them has remained : jesus . why ? because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah , and go on to die for those beliefs , if they knew that he had not been resurrected . * * even if the gospels are dated more liberally , we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels . and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier . what i am saying is that flemming 's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-christian view . do n't be fooled by poor investigation .
assuming this wo n't end up a straight-to-video release , i would have to say void this title at all costs . unless you 're bored of good , well-executed movies , that is . i saw this last night at afi dallas , and i left with 20 minutes remaining , simply because i did n't care anymore ( about the plot , not about insulting the director ... that is awkward ) . when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie ( a shot out , shattered window before any shots are fired ... and then the window breaks with the first shot ) , things are going to bad . let 's just say this is only an indicator of things to come ... unfortunately . i 'll spare you all the details , but this is sub-par in every manner , even the half-assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you 're expecting half-assed acting from him . and the rape scene ... christ ! `` shut up and take it '' should never be used in a rape scene . ever . 3/10
anyone not aware of the 1973 original british lion movie ' the wicker man ' would , no doubt , have left the cinema with the impression 'poor ' and 'peurile ' . as a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely poor . from the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island , named summerisle ( the original ) to a near amazon-ic colony off the maine coast of the us , named summersisle , the remake hardly hits the spot . this is , quite sadly , a case of what 'could ' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public . nothing more and nothing less . gentlemen ( or given the reworked context of the film ) ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame .
mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957 . well , the movie mainly takes place in 1986 . the movie falls into the 80 's trap of weird/stupid special effects , including some weird demented looking rocking horse . anyway , mary lou 's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person 's body . whether or not she succeeds , you 'll have to watch to find out . anyway , the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters . this also is n't really a sequel , the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school . it has the avg . horror flick fall backs , gore , pointless nudity , knocks against the catholic church . basic stuff , boring movie . the acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 . you can waste your time doing something else .
what the hell is this ? its one of the dumbest movies i 've seen . i do n't understand why people on this site love it so much . its senseless & nudity for no reason . its worst then resident evil . i strongly do n't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy , bad acting crap . watch real horor movies such as stephen king 's it , the shining , jurassic park ( kinda horor ) , jaws , etc . leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent . it is bad as crudy vs gayson . attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this crap . oh wow flesh eating zombies . how many damn zobie movies do we need . skip this one . * outta * * * *
how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion . this film is absolutely criminal . before watching this movie i thought manos : hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw , but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep , thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer . the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins `` locked '' up makes it to the final scene . the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life .
i would love to have that two hours of my life back . it seemed to be several clips from steve 's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script . do n't go , if you must see it , wait for the video ...
i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom . we ( my g-friend and i ) walked out about an hour into it . what a load of pseudo scientific new age jargon . sub atomic particles are thoughts ? by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals ? a drop of 25 % in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated . wow , what a rigorous scientific study . i 'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time . should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate ? hogwash , hooey , bull pucky ! btw- it was funded by the ramtha cult , the leader of which was one of the `` experts '' which were interview by the filmmakers . no ulterior motives here , right ?
i would have liked to write about the story , but there was n't any . i would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but `` hinglish '' is only funny for like 5 minutes , after that its overkill . i would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense ' but it was as predictable as ... um mm , a yash raj movie ( ? ) . i would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action , but i do n't like cartoons much . * sigh * all in all , this movie is perfect for : 1. people attempting suicide - i promise it 'll push you over the edge 2 . sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that silas guy in the da-vinci code wore . 3 . people researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - i swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 . movie piraters : more power to them . if any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it . 5.barnacles , most types of plankton & green algae - because almost all other living things would require an iq factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers . afterthought : the director of the movie , obviously , is a species of his own . ( and i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .. one is enough ) things that could have made this a better movie : 1 . a story 2 . a choreographer 3 . a screenplay writer 4 . a stunt coordinator 5 . a story ( did i already say that ? ) 6 . a director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job ) 7 . anil kapoor=bubonic plague - avoid at all costs 8 . a statutory warning - `` watching yash raj movies is injurious to your mental health '' ? things i liked about the movie : 1 . kareena kapoor - for obvious reasons 2 . the english sub-titles - `` mera dil kho gaya '' becomes - `` my heart is in a void '' , `` chaliya chaliya chaliya '' turns into `` im a flirt , im a lover , im a vagabond '' .. priceless . in short , tashan to me , is like the opposite of a rubrics cube - the cube is supposed to increase the iq of the player , tashan promises to lower your iq , and that .. in a mere 2.5 hours ! woot ! * sigh * .. but thats just me . i could be wrong you 've been warned anyways .
in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse , the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires , but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu 's famous short novel than my mother 's lasagna recipe . bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it . the plot , and i use that term loosely , involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with `` the general , '' whose daughter is missing , at a church to kill a vampire who , very conveniently , happens to be traveling with the father and daughter . i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor . the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested . anyone older beware .
* possible spoiler * 'return to cabin by the lake ' is a useless movie . the acting was not good and the plot was n't even remotely interesting . 'cabin by the lake ' is a good tv movie . the sequel was not . judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this . it seemed as if he was n't even interested in doing the sequel . his acting was good but it could have been better . i really do n't want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion , they 're not even worth mentioning . but i 'll do it . the character of alison is n't even hardly shown in the first part of the film . all of a sudden she 's the center of attention next to stanley caldwell . the role did n't make sense and it should have been thought out a little better . dahlia salem was absolutely terrible . her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else , anybody else . the director , mike , was a confusing character . he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it did n't seem like his death was necessary . the acting for this role was good , nothing great but better than salem 's . the plot was real lousy if you think about it . stanley , who is presumed dead , makes his way onto the set of 'cabin by the lake ' , the movie based on his script . he stumbles upon the director and in a short time , the director is dead and stanley is running the show . yeah , out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him . there 's some killings , not a whole lot , and the one 's that are shown are ridiculous . one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene . another character gets chewed up by a motorboat . and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning . these writers must have been hard up for excitement . i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie . the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast . also , the new cabin by the lake was poorly created . we are n't shown it but only in a few scenes , and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless . it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more , but it did n't work in this one . there were too many characters in this sequel . all of them except for a few had no reason to be there . the acting of what little is showed was really bad and ... they just did n't have a purpose in this movie . all in all , 'return to cabin by the lake ' is a sequel picking up from where the first left off . 'cabin by the lake ' i can take but this was just not impressive . judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you . it 's nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow . nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second . not to mention that the writing was horrible . put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep . so , we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well . by the way he talks , it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself . quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright ! ( did the film makers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the lake scenes from the first one ? they were all done in a tank . never , never reveal the secrets of filming . )
the opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta . the attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish i had better control of the fast forward control . vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures . this vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy . i usually tally a body count , so there was a cat ( which does n't count ) a bum , a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her ( whatever that was about ) and then the plot . foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm , but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly . i liked warlock , but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off , and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off again .
what was the point of this movie ? what was the plot ? i do not know . shaq ca n't act , people do n't know how to direct , and i am kazaam ! a genie who raps ? come on . maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this . i remember i watched this just to kill time . it did n't really interest me . i just remember thinking , `` who put shaq in this movie ? ? ? '' the whole story seemed stupid too . it made no sense whatsoever . i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen . i ca n't comment much more because this movie is so terrible there 's nothing worth commenting about . i `` wish '' this movie would go away .
generally , i 've found that if you do n't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd , there 's probably a good reason for it . i had n't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf . since all the good movies had already been rented out ( the ones i wanted to see , anyway ) , i figured i 'd give this one a shot . it 's really not much different than other movies in the genre , such as the singles ward or the r.m . if you 're into those type movies , you 'll probably enjoy this . however , if you 're not a mormon , this movie probably wo n't appeal to you . there 's no way to avoid the overtly religious ( mormon ) message contained within , and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy . ultimately , if you do n't fall within the mormon demographic , you 're probably better off watching something else . admittedly , there were some very funny moments in the film , but i did n't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall .
i loved this movie , i 'll admit it . this has to be the best ( straight to ? ) video movie i 've seen . well ... me and my friend decided just for shits n ' giggles that we 'd rent this movie . we knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected , plus more . when that red neck gets slammed up against the tree by the sasquatch , we literally watched that part about three to four times , it was that amazing ( hysterically , of course ) . and why ? oh why does the main character have to roll that much ? like honestly , we know that you 're in danger , rolling that much is n't gon na help all that much . but really , if this movie is in you 're local video store rent it . it is worth the money and it 's not even that bad , like it 's bad , but not incredibly bad . overall , complete amazing will be in store for you if you rent this movie .
this movie had so much potential . anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it 's ridiculous . too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer 's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption . where was the character development ? the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception . where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals ? instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer , but fail to address the major point in dahmer 's development . also , the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this ; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh , etc . i could go on , but to sum up , too many lagging points in the film , focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is `` dahmer . ''
i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic , sado-masochistic , child pornography that i witnessed . the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes - and , not one is in the least bit erotic - sick is the more the feeling . the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this . see it if you can stomach it - i still have flashbacks .
i used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made . it had much the charm of `` get smart '' . while it admittedly had its faults , it was rather enjoyable . naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version . that was before i saw it . afterwords i wished it had never been made . besides being miscast all around ( who on earth though broderick was even close to the role ? ) it just did n't make the grade . the effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing i liked about the movie ; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action ! what was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting . the original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude . it was fun . the motion picture became murky and took itself far too seriously . if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a `` cartoon on film '' it might have been enjoyable . as it exists it does n't deserve to be considered part of the `` gadget legacy '' .
if you seen rodney dangerfield 's previous movies and performances , you 'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck . written like a sitcom , this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout , from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver molly shannon to the ' i 'm fat , and therefore funny ' john linette . the 5 wives themselves are likeable enough , and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series , it might have worked . instead , it comes off like a male fantasy that 's trying hard not to be politically incorrect .
i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.but it turned out to be the the biggest let down . a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss . it was vulgar and distasteful i do n't think dr seuss would have approved.how the grinch stole christmas was much better . i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on . whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked.growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .lets see what they do with horton hears a who.i hope this one does dr seuss some justice .
it was so terrible . it was n't fun to watch at all . even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator , even that 's not fun to watch in this movie . i say again , the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch . or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched , just girl on couch using a vibrator . maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters , maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level . my advice , fast forward to that point , watch it , rewind the movie , watch it again , rewind , repeat . maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way . this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen .
this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares . for a horror or `` thriller '' film and hype , it 's way too tame . there are only a few tense moments in here , not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre . even those `` tense '' scenes were n't much . the music made them more dramatic that they actually were . there is a lot of symbolism in here , so the elitist critics label this `` a thinking person 's horror film . '' well , if they think about it , i 'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did - a waste of money at the video rental store . summary : a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting . vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised .
* * spoilers contained * * i 'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . what i did n't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . what starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy ' about honus ( soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss ) and cresta ( candice bergen ) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne . the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . they then escape and both turn up ( separately ) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base . as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . so far so ordinary . then comes the ending . after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/wo n't they get together storyline , the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and did n't resort to extreme gratuitous violence . in some ways , soldier blue reminds me of frank perry 's last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . i did n't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents , i would recommend elem klimov 's come and see .
... was so that i could , in good conscience , tell everyone how horrible this movie is . i barely made it through twenty minutes before i started thinking to myself , '' wow , this is pretty bad. '' . and , to be honest , i would 've given this movie 1 star if it was n't for esai morales ( though he had very little screen time ) . he 's the movie 's only well-acted role , which is a shame because i really like gil bellows ... or at least i thought i did . while watching this i started thinking back to his part in `` shawshank redemption '' and realized it was n't as good as i thought it was . problem : his jail-house/tough guy act seems like it 's just that , an act ; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression . has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was supposed to ? i doubt it , but maybe he should have . and , to make matters worse , they 've managed to inject a little jail-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived , especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a `` rasta '' who 's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural . i would n't normally slam a movie like this , but when i saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review . i felt like i was cheated and lied to , and i thought i should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie . i say boooooooo .
normally , i do n't like revenge films .... period . but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise . you see , di has action , accuracy , exotic locales ( i.e . hong kong ) , awesome gun battles , and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat . like all revenge flicks , it has villains you 'd love to throw out of a plate-glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building ! however , double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist , racist , and venomous social stereotypes that invaded `` eye for an eye '' and `` death wish 2 '' . but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap . chad and alex 's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that 's what i remembered . the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one . it was n't the watery plot that made this movie bad , but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies ( from lethal weapon to the princess bride ) really made it worse . but nonetheless double impact is still watchable . but why is that shitty movies like this have villains ( for example , that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex 's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick ) you would love to hate with fiber of your being ?
i am a current a.s.l . student & was forced to watch this movie in class , and what i got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film . the film is obviously leaning towards to p.o.v . of the `` common deaf perception '' their is no middle ground . also , the film did n't make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic . i.e . deaf people who were born hearing and later went deaf . is it right or wrong in that instance ? the film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the deaf w/ a capital `` d '' . not that this is bad , but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly unbiased .
this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw ? the beginning is somewhat good , but the end ? i still do n't even get it ! magical power , 300 years later , goddess , dancing what the f * * * is that about ? ? ? the acting is somewhat not so bad .. but some place i could do better for sure !
bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of english fiction into a movie , and then slapped silly for this attempt . the animation was poor , the characters looked ridiculous , the music was overwhelmingly blaring , and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of tolkien 's masterpiece . i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it . now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways , simply because of the medium , but this movie , regardless of the source of the story , is just plain pathetic . bashki is capable of much more .
this is the sorriest collection of clichés , strung together on a straight line , with no discernible plot or any decent way of acting i 've seen in a long time . canibalising scenes from star wars , reign of fire , godzilla , lord of the rings and harry potter , it went for an all out war on the viewer intelligence . was this movie good ? it was n't a movie at all ! even if it does n't go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy , the movie does offer some laughs . the trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films . gandalf can be funny talking korean , the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun switching back and forth between sauron and jaja-bing , or whatever his name was . bottom line : any pleasure derived from this movie is completely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers , not on the director/writer . shame on you , shim !
towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy 's gaunt latter-day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image . she convinces one that , if a nasty bette davis-type role were to come her way , she could carry it off brilliantly . unfortunately , i ca n't find many other reasons for seeing this . if you 've wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses ( but why should anyone ? ) then here 's your answer . for the rest , sally kirkland 's sex-starved crazy woman is really tiresome , and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you 'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes . savage 's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it 's a small role . of the leading actors , nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul keller 's plight and his acting is wooden . dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little . sheedy 's meticulous , understated performance ( though she often seems to be on automatic pilot ) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest . the sets are drab , the camera-work undistinguished .
what a bad movie . i 'm really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this . if you 're going to make a movie that involves baseball , and shows scenes of baseball , at least make the action look somewhat realistic . why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games ? * * * possible spoiler * * * and the last scene in the movie .... what was that ? we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire 's uniform , and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour .... one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie . 3 stars out of 10 .
how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this ? it 's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - even the well-known gottfried john is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish ....... ! the screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie . be careful not to fall asleep while watching ! the set is obviously very often a blue screen , f.g. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background ... ! in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason : different languages of actors - but : other international productions do handle this much more professional . advice : do not watch - it 's a diabolic waste of time !
i 'll be honest- the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler 's ( most notably from early edition ) . since he usually plays the good guy , i wanted to see him as in a different role ( out of curiosity ) . the plot itself also drew me in ; a wanna-be hitman ( tony greco- a.k.a . mr. chandler ) must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life- or , rather , the death- of a witness who will testify against someone in `` the family '' . the movies was nothing like i expected . it was sick , i hated the end ( if you saw it , you 'd know why ) , and there were so many unnecessary parts . basically- it was filthy , and made little sense . yes , it was a mob movie , and yes the guns do go boom . but there 's more to a movie than that . this film acted as if it did n't have the time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it . the acting really made up for it- james belushi was pretty amusing as `` the rose '' . sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get . she surprised me the most . and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to `` the family '' . if only the script did justice to the actors .
i blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that i paid as much as i did but i would say that it 's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting . it is not a good movie in any way but i must say that i was pretty darn entertained . i guess it could be called so-bad-it's-good . as i said , the acting is awful , i feel like i could have done a better job showing , at least , any emotion . the story is nothing new and has been done better . i guess i just have a soft spot for any carnival-esquire type film . i would say rent this or download it but definitely do n't buy it . it is not worth more than one watch .
this film stars , among others , `` slapchop '' vince offer ( who also wrote , edited and directed ) and joey buttafuoco -- not exactly names that scream out `` quality '' . and with such uplifting skits as `` supermodels taking a dump '' ( it 's exactly what it sounds like ) , a guy who robs a sperm bank ( the `` rhymer '' ) , necrophilia with a rotting corpse , black market fetuses ( featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar ) , lots and lots of gay jokes , a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions . the skits are painfully unfunny ( such as `` batman and rhymer '' ) , the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude ... and stupid . i truly believe a group of 8 year-olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budget . apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by `` slap shot '' vince against the scientologists . frankly , i would n't know who to root for in this case ! ! ! apparently , he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film . no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99 % unfunny ( by comparison , ebola is funnier ) ... and these are the nicest things i can say about the movie . by the way , that is bobby lee ( from `` mad tv '' ) wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film . it 's amazing his career could overcome this .
it 's been a while since seeing this the first time , so i watched it again with the second movie in the series . while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i have n't seen yet , i 'll review under the original title ... just from the standpoint of production value , screen writing , and movie making , this movie fails on many levels , though it succeeds on a few as well . what can you expect from a low-budget , `` b '' movie ? not much , and it works from the standpoint of production . however , the writing is certainly disjointed , with little in the way of character development ... exactly what i 'd expect when there is an agenda to a film . i did n't have a problem with the acting ... the cast is solid ; however , the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves . because the film is `` christian , '' this is predictable , as you ca n't very well portray violent chaos of the `` end times '' without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity . in other words , the mistake comes in making this into a g-rated film when the content , even in the most conservative of bible interpretations , would be r-rated by any measure . so , if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith , then the movie should be somewhat scary , right ? however , you ca n't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book , or in this case , series of books . there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies ... but not the `` left behind '' series ... and these movies ultimately fail because , while being best-sellers , they are poorly written novels based on bad theology . as a southern baptist minister , i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me , though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series . i have described them as decent fiction , and if the books would take the point of view that this is one `` possibility '' or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology ( study of the `` end times ) , then i could live with that . however , this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the `` literalist '' interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic . inevitably , this leads to the `` pre-trib , pre-millenial '' dispensation point of view , which confines an all-powerful god far too by humanity 's world . in other words , as i 've always said , god should n't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work . but because many people , particularly unstudied christians , ca n't think beyond their own world-views , we are left with a pro-conservative , fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation , and attempts to push it through as the `` only '' interpretation . thus , the books carry with them an agenda , not so much to get the `` lost '' to understand their need for christ , but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible . i recall very clearly reading ( several years ago ) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was `` left behind '' because of his non-adherence to this point of view ; as if `` real '' christians worthy to be `` raptured '' could n't possibly hold to another eschatology . this is disturbing for several reasons , the least of which is because a `` rapture '' is only briefly mentioned in scripture and it 's connection to real , end-time prophecy is tenuous at best . but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray `` true '' christian behavior . ultimately , i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith/religion instead of win people towards it . it turns all christians into caricatures , equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice . as a christian body , on the whole , we 've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history ... and we certainly do n't need to promote it by film to thousands , maybe millions of others . thus , the `` left behind '' movies fail because the `` left behind '' books are n't worthy to be interpreted into movies .
basic slasher movie premise , 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family . yawn . watching 36 minutes of a premonition of oj 's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco . yawn . old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... yawn 23 minutes of watching the actors eat - yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... ok there might be a drinking game here ... nope - yawn complimentary shower scenes ... ok got my interest for a couple of seconds . completely random and uninspired killings ... yawn the ending ... dude ! that psycho is deranged - why could n't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that is it - my advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me i am going back to sleep .
... is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire : scandal , sex , celebrity , power . kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she 's in `` legally blonde . '' the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him . eddie izzard is pretty good , except that he 's playing charlie chaplin , and is about , oh , 125 lbs too heavy for the part ? hard to believe this hamfisted , uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich , but then again , he has n't made a watchable movie in , what ? 30 years ? sometimes , there 's just no coming back .
much worse than the original . it was actually * painful * to sit through , and it barely held my six year old 's interest . introduction of some new pokemon is marginally interesting , but storyline is extra-thin , dialogue is still bad , and music is mediocre . watch the television show instead - it 's much better .
i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe ... and i was n't far off . there 's a fair amount of glimpsed gore , and they threw in lots of nudity , but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists . holy cow , they actually put a little thought into the story , and did n't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset . and dare i say it , some of the `` gratuitous '' nudity was n't so gratuitous after all , because it fit in with the story and setting . do n't get me wrong , it 's still overall a bad movie , but as bad movies go , it 's a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster .
of the many problems with this film , the worst is continuity ; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago , i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong . what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing . how much longer ? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously . that 's staggering ; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here ? their previous film , `` white zombie '' , was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films ( the mummy , dracula , etc . ) , and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines . revolt of the zombies , to the contrary , appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war . this would not only explain the opening , and the change of dean jagger 's character into a megalomaniac , but it also explains why the zombies do n't actually do much in the film , besides stand around , look frightening , and wait for orders - they 're just allegorical soldiers , not the undead cannibals we 've all come to love and loathe in zombie films . i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first , and only later , maybe , educational . and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies . truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history , but not one i can recommend , even for historic value .
i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library . nothing against low budget movies , but this movie has horrible acting and directing . how can a movie as this one ever be made . the director should be blacklisted , and for all the poor actors , it is for sure not a jumping board into a career . please make sure that you 'll not watch this movie , the acting is lame , the camera and directing awful . there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the `` low 10 '' . another example would be `` dracula 3000 '' . people who make money with this movie should give it to charity , so at least it serves for a good reason . in this case i would watch it even another 10 ( or at least one more time ) .
save the $ 8.97 you 'll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg . i 'm a filmmaker , and being an avid fan of h.g . wells , i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment . instead , it took four days to finish watching this because i could n't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time . it 's horrible . there are reports that timothy hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production . where the heck did it go ? did he use most of it to buy a new house ? finance his retirement ? or what ? let me start with what is actually good about this film . it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it . i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film . but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible ... and i do mean horrible special effects . any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi . to me , most of it looked like `` stop action '' card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a $ 20 million project should be using . there 's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film . my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created . i 've seen films with budgets of less than $ 2 million look better . much better . in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines ' special effects in this film . in fact , i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film . there 's no excuse with today 's technology for a film to look like a 50 's b-movie unless that was the intention , which should n't have been with this particular project . a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky , another demonstration of amateur film-making . overall , i have to say that i produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film . i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead . it would be easier on the eyes .
i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie . be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book . many of the book 's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie . it is a `` b '' movie at best . many events , characters , how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur . the flow of events that in the book are very smooth , are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child . the character development is very poor . personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book . the direction is similar to a `` b '' horror flick . i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book , but they screen play base missed many points . the casting was very good .
* * * * warning : here be spoilers * * * * why do i waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this ? this film is an impressive collection of clichés , poor writing , worse directing , and then we have n't even got to the acting yet . and of course , you can predict the whole story from beginning to end . hero expert fights against stupid , corrupt and incompetent henchmen . one avalanche goes off , burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils . corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money . second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade expert 's adventurous experiment . evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well . troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her . etc , etc , etc , etc , on and on it goes . in fact , there 's little reason to warn for spoilers . you could probably work the whole plot out if i gave you the basic ingredients . at least , i was n't too wide off the mark most of the time , anticipating what would happen next . and then we have n't discussed the factual errors . i agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually some redeeming features even of a bad movie . you 'd be hard pressed to find any in this one . i suppose i gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots , but that 's it . it 's been some time since a film made me groan , but this one certainly did .
i bought this dvd set , sight unseen , and wish i had n't . the script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book . the lighting is horrid , very unpolished , but if it was just that i could overlook it . the script does n't focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who ( especially in the planes -- no idea who dies when ) . i have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters ; if you do n't have that you do n't have anything . there was no focus on the characters at all -- you never got to know them -- who they were , what they liked .. what made them do the things that they do . the series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts ... i bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they did n't detail the characters -- -they put a lot of filler in it .... i will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes lol ( i mean do we really need to see that over and over again ? ? ? ) . i would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters .
this was an awful movie ! not for the subject matter , but for the delivery . i went with my girlfriend at the time ( when the movie came out ) , expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression . what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression , with no uplift at the end . the previews and ads made no mention of this ! plus , for all that they played up whoopi goldberg , my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes ! again , the previews say nothing about this ! ( not that you would expect that , but it 's just more of the problem ) . if i had known how depressing this movie would be , i would 've never have seen it . or at least , i would 've been prepared for it . this was a bait and switch ad campaign , and i will never see this movie again !
i am a great fan of martin amis , on whose book this film is based . unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen . the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development . it is an hilarious examination of human greed , excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers . the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel . in his hands , the film screams along at breakneck speed , indulging in every known trick shot and 'odd ' camera angle possible . it is like ken russel on acid , and suffers from that older director 's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred . not even the ( brief ) glimpse of gorgeous actor christian solimeno 's penis was enough to save this wretched film for me . abysmal !
it 's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows , as superficial and brutal as the `` garcea '' series or the `` vacanta mare '' child-plays ... the difference is that mugur mihäescu , doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as `` art '' . pintilie , who 40 years ago made a very good movie ( `` duminicä la ora sase '' ) followed by another one , nice enough ( `` reconstituirea '' ) , tries to declare his film-lenghts `` art works '' - but , unfortunately , he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression . as such , `` niki ardelean '' offers again a sample of `` how not '' - this being about its only merit .
wow . that 's about as much as i can say right now . who writes this stuff ? who produces this stuff ? what self-respecting actor would agree to 'act ' in this stuff ? oh my god ! i do n't know how i made it through this movie , but i assume the fact that i had had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake . good lord ! it was one of the most droned-out and predictable pieces of cinematography i have ever witnessed ... and for the record , i do n't ever plan to 'witness ' it again . i first saw the film when i bought the dvd ( mistake # 1 ) . i mean ... i figured , hey ! julia stiles . i like her . she 's cool . i 'll watch it as soon as i get home ( mistake # 2 ) . i tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end , really i did . but i was unsuccessful . it was one of the worst things i had ever seen . i mean ... what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life ? that was annoying enough when the father used to do that in 'parenthood ' like ten years ago . the 'jokes ' - and believe me , it takes a lot out of me to call them that - are stupid , the characters are trite and forgettable , the storyline is entirely predictable ... altogether this makes for a movie that should be wiped from history records ! i should have figured something was wrong when i realized that i 'd never heard of this movie . it was most likely a straight-to-dvd . to anybody who may be thinking of watching this , i have one piece of advice . do n't ! for the love of god ... do n't ! ! ! i 'm ashamed to have it in my dvd collection , and i ca n't get rid of it ... nobody , and i mean nobody wants to buy it from me ! and i 'm talking second-hand and third-hand thrift shops that would buy the mud off your shoes and stick it in the store window . that should let you know just how crap it is .
admittedly , i did n't have high expectations of `` corky romano . '' but then again , who did ? however , i felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt . i had no high hopes of `` joe dirt '' either -- another recent comedy starring an snl cast member -- and i ended up being pleasantly surprised . but this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews . chris kattan is actually a talented comic actor -- contrary to what you might think after watching this movie -- with great energy . he 's been in many hilarious snl skits , and i think he 's one of the most talented cast members on snl as of now . in this case , he 's given a lame , pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging . throughout each scene , he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably . jerry lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy , not to mention he worked with much better writing . kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with adhd who had one too many cafe lattes . he does n't even wait for the punchline ; he assumes we 'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack . in one scene , he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth . the package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him . he comes back to the job , strung out on coke . now , how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he 's acting hyper and on-edge , when he 's doing the same thing throughout the whole film ? as for the rest of the cast members ... vanessa shaw is really hot , peter berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is chris penn . peter falk is also wasted , though he has a few funny lines that i 'm pretty sure he improvised . i hope falk gets a decent movie someday soon . that 's too much talent too waste on a clunker like `` corky romano . '' i did n't like falk 's last movie `` made '' all that much either , but at least he had a decent role . i chuckled a few times , but i could not get a single laugh . each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery . and it 's made worse by kattan 's hammy acting . and there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out . for example , when kattan is about to fart in his two brothers ' faces . he stands there for 2 or 3 minutes , trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it 's a little tiny one . it 's bad enough when you have a gag that 's funny and drag it out , but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it 's a hell of a lot worse . and another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two asian men are saying during a drug bust . i can go on and on about what 's wrong with this so-called comedy , but i 'm not gon na waste my time . like i said earlier , if you predicted bad things from the trailers -- you predicted right . my score : 3 ( out of 10 )
do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series . it is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other . there is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance . it is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come . and it does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency . take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile .
i will admit that i 'm only a college student at this present time , an english major at that . at the time i saw this film i was a high school student -- i want to say junior year but it may have been senior , hard to remember . my experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course , an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article i can find in discover and the like . i 'm not a phd by any means . that said ... this movie is simply terrible . it 's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average new age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is . my mother is such a person and ever since she 's seen this movie she 's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film . i attempted to point out the various flaws and problems i 'd seen with the films logic and science -- and they are numerous -- and she dismissed my claims because `` oh , so a high school student knows more than all those people with phds . '' in this case , apparently so . leaving behind the fact that earning a phd does n't necessarily require that a person be correct or , in fact , intelligent . leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film . leaving that behind , the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when , in fact , he completely opposed them . i could go on and on but i think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so . http : //www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
it 's been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg-crossing that twisted many people 's minds . and now , god knows why , she 's in the game again . `` basic instinct 2 '' is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica `` basic instinct '' featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas . however , fans of the original might not even get close to this one , since `` instinct 2 '' is painful film-making , as the mediocre director michael caton-jones assassinates the legacy of the first film . the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning . catherine tramell ( sharon stone , trying to look forcefully sexy ) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder . a psychiatrist ( a horrible david morrisey ) is appointed to examine her , but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction . and there it is , without no further explanations , the basic force that moves this `` instinct '' . nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy , c-class erotic film . sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn-off . part of it because of the amateurish writing , the careless direction , and terrifyingly low chemistry . the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality ( a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this would n't be rated nc-17 ) than the first entrance in the series . `` instinct '' is a compelling torture . to top it off , everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film . the acting here is really bad . sharon stone has some highlights , but here , she gets extremely obnoxious . david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life , and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie- confused and aroused . `` instinct 2 '' is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series , that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well . paul verhoeven , how i miss you .... `` basic instinct 2 '' never sounded like a good movie , and , indeed , it is n't . some films should never get out of paper , and that is the feeling you get after watching this . now , it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out , and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this ...... -- -- -3/10
damn , i thought i 'd seen some bad westerns . ca n't top this one though . hell i think i 'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a trinity triple feature for cryin out loud . i dont think i 'll be able to watch ben hur again without laughing my ass off . just really bad . but hey , if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at shoot out with gregory peck . it 's just as bad , but much funnier . 1/10
it 's interesting that a novel with no plot has become the basis for two films . while the heiress was a good , if not entirely accurate , adaptation , washington square is a heavy-handed and poorly acted , except for the part of dr sloper , film that could have been so much better . the director 's attempts at making 'beautiful ' scenes were so obvious that i actually cringed . it has none of the understated and simple beauty that a movie with no plot can have , such as onegin . i agree with other comments about leigh 's portrayal of catherine as an idiot , instead of naive and shy ; she made me despise her not feel for her . catherine 's transition from childlike trusting to adult cynicism , the whole point of the story , was internalised , just as it was in the novel . but we do n't have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us that in a film ! i think someone skipped adaptation class at filmschool . i appreciate the director 's attempts to make a moving and beautiful film out of a difficult text but it just did n't work .
`` raw force '' is like an ultra-sleazy and perverted version of love boat , with additional kung fu fights , demented cannibalistic monks , white slaves trade , energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances . no wonder this movie was included in the recently released `` grindhouse experience 20 movie box-set '' . it 's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for , blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script ! the production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic , but the amounts of gratuitous violence & sex can hardly be described . the film opens at a tropically sunny location called warriors island , where a troop of sneering monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into kung fu fighters . the monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy hitler look-alike businessman , supposedly because the women 's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army . tourists on a passing cruise ship , among them three martial arts fighters , a female la cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim-witted ladies , are attacked by the hitler guy 's goons because they were planning an excursion to warriors island . their lifeboat washes ashore the island anyway , and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies . okay , how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess ? it 's not over yet , because `` raw force '' also has piranhas , wild boat orgies , cameron mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70 's exploitation duchess camille keaton ( `` i spit on your grave '' ) in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance . there 's loads of badly realized gore , including axe massacres and decapitations , hammy jokes and bad taste romance . the trash-value of this movie will literally leave you speechless . the evil monks ' background remains , naturally , unexplained and they do n't even become punished for their questionable hobbies . maybe that 's why the movie stops with `` to be continued '' , instead of with `` the end '' . the sequel never came , unless it 's so obscure imdb does n't even list it .
cut tries to be like most post-scream slashers tried to be , a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies . now , i am not bagging 'scream , ' as i think 'scream ' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy . cut fails on most levels . it has its moments but overall it just does not work out , not even as a `` so bad it 's good '' movie , just a below average one . the first five minutes or so are ok and set the story fairly well , apart from the fact that kylie minogue ca n't really act , and ironically she gets her tongue out , go figure . go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off , which is apparently cursed . and , as you have probably predicted , one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman . unoriginal plot , poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow . there is plenty of referencing in the film , everything from 'scream ' to 'the texas chain saw massacre . ' this is n't smart either , it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala scream . for a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity , which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it . really , i should be supporting this movie because i 'm australian and we 're not as good when it comes to horror ( we do have our gems , though ) but cut is definitely not one of them . however , it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so , so that is something good at least . i would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans , who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for , but if you are looking for a good movie , stay away . 2/5
... but this just is n't working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good . on what grounds ? there are some loose hints here and there , but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing . lynch 's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet , are very playful when doing that . there is some visual sense , there are some subplots , characters , ideas etc . but this is dull and yes , pointless . because whatever there is to explore is either to `` small '' , either too far-fetched , or simply told before in a superior manner . it 's just lynch exploring dv , nothing more so it should be treated like this . 1/10
it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy . it is not only oppressively preachy , but absurd , stagebound , dramatically straight-jacketed , and painfully overwrought . watching it , one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write `` i will not become a fascist '' on the blackboard 100 times . now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 , and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about , ( which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud ) and i 'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day . but it is presented in such an immature , over-obvious , sledgehammer way , it fails abysmally as a work of art . the only good performances here are from paul lukas , who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist ; and lucile watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become . though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships , the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips . they do not even remotely resemble real human beings . and bette davis , a great actress , here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen . her every word , her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for , that she must 've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal . so yes , this is a very important film , just not a very good one .
this is , without doubt , one of the worst films i 've ever seen ... the plot is so full of holes , the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time . worst of all is steve guttenberg . he plays his character like he was in `` police academy '' - the same foolish womanizer - and that 's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller . it 's really hard to believe that hanson would make `` l.a . confidential '' ten years later ... avoid this like the plague ...
truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director ted tetzlaff . decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever . ford , as someone put it here , sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk . there are some details thrown around- canadian ex-army or raf , defused bombs in the war , his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much . the bomber himself is a complete mystery . why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines ? for that matter , what time period are we talking about here ? wwii or postwar ? ? i assumed the latter which makes bomber 's motive even more salient . generally , though , just a horrible film . there are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one . watch any episode of `` danger uxb '' for a more exciting time , at about the same running time .
every new fall line-up show deserves , at least , my `` 3 strikes and you 're out '' policy . i give a comedy 3 chances to make me laugh , that is , 3 complete episodes . after episode 1 , i actually said to the tv , '' cancelled tomorrow '' . it was that bad . i have now watched the first 4 episodes of `` cavemen '' and have yet to manage even a smirk . not a titter , a guffaw , a chortle , as a matter of fact , no facial movement at all . i will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show . i 'm simply not `` getting '' it , but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in prime-time , just has to be funny ; but there are no laughs from me yet . there 's just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at 8:00 p.m . i know there has got to be an inside joke that just is n't jiving with my brain . i 've read each of the previous comments , i `` get '' the social aspect of it , but , where are the jokes ? ? ? ? i shall continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week , until i have a light-bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting `` eureka '' .
terrible ... just terrible . probably the worst film i have ever seen . and i did see some pretty bad pictures , throughout the years . the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture , the direction , the acting ... etc , etc . the only good shoots ( meaning funny , because they 're so bad ) are the special effects . overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs . the rest of the flick gives you brain damage .
because you can put it on fast forward and watch the inane story , without having to listen to banal dialogue , and be finished in 10 minutes max . come to think of it , even 10 minutes is too much to waste on enid-blyton-meets-struggling-wanna-be-artists . vomit .
lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang ziyi , in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 china , just prior to the japanese invasion of manchuria , and reunites with a former lover who is now working for japan . every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director ye lou 's somnambulist directorial style . characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes , saying nothing , hand-held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to , edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy . we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses , only silence and static shots of lovers who do n't speak , who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy . a very sleep inducing film .
the movie starts little cute . there are a number of revolting scenes . people in toilets . good actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here . this did not need to be crude . forget it . find the tv show . disney at new low .
i do n't know where to start ; the acting , the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine . i ca n't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said , `` our job is done , time for it 's release '' . i 'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk . i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are . i do n't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the `` terrifying '' dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around .
this show is terrible , the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse . i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two , all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them . well at least corner gas was good at first , little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. who are the people who are watching this show anyway , i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies ? maybe the jokes are for them and they work there ? i do n't know a single person who likes this show and ca n't stand it myself , the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas . hopefully it wo n't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show .
what is this ? ! is it a comedy , a horror movie or just nothing ? ? this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf , that must be the worst scene that has ever been made . this movie is n't funny , it is n't scary and not entertaining at all . please do yourself ( and me , i do n't think anyone should suffer through this movie ) a favour and do n't watch this movie ! ! if you get is a present , just throw it away and chop it in to pieces .
jennifer 's shadow is set in argentina & starts as jennifer cassi ( gina philips ) arrives there after her sister johanna dies . jennifer is left johanna 's large house in her will , jennifer decides to sell the house & head back to los angeles even though her grandmother mary ellen ( faye dunaway ) is opposed to the sale . however strange things begin to happen , jennifer starts having nightmares about ravens pecking at her & she starts to feel very ill. after a check up in hospital it seems that one of her kidney 's have mysteriously disappeared , what is happening to jennifer ? is it an ancient family curse ? will jennifer be the next to succumb to it ... this argentinian american co-production was co-written & co-directed by daniel de la vega & pablo parés & is a really dull waste of ninety odd minutes , a tedious & predictable modern ghost story that i would imagine will put more people to sleep sooner than scare them . the script by vega , parés & p.j . pettiette is pretty slow going & tedious which is not what anyone wants , i mean i 'm sure most people do n't want to sit down & be bored out of their skulls . the character 's are all uninteresting & fairly faceless with little or no motivation for anything they do . for instance who is that graveyard caretaker guy ? how did he know about the demons ? what is his interest & motivation for getting involved ? i could n't see it . jennifer herself is a pretty unlikable & bland leading lady , her grandmother mary allen is as clichéd as they come & it 's surprising that she is so obviously the villain . i mean for this sort of mystery based horror/ghost story it 's surprisingly predictable & routine . there are gaps in both logic & the story which together with the terrible twist ending which is n't much of a twist i did n't like jennifer 's shadow one iota . directors vega & parés goes down the much used route of bleaching almost all of the colour from the picture which often renders it not too far from black and white , i suspect that they wanted to give it a period gothic feel but it 's been done so many times before & often so much better that it did n't do much for me at all & just makes the whole film look dull & lifeless . there 's a definite 40 's period look as well , from the costumes to the interior of the large house but again it 's rather half hearted & cheap looking . jennifer 's shadow is well made but it 's rather forgettable , it 's not scary or creepy & it 's rather predictable . if that was n't enough there 's no gore either , there 's a few scenes of ravens pecking away at people & a beating heart but nothing else . with a supposed budget of about $ 1,000,000 & retitled to the chronicles of the raven for it 's us & international dvd release this is reasonably well made but a million wo n't buy you too much these days & jennifer 's shadow pretty much proves that theory . there are too many scenes of actor 's speaking in thick argentinian accents as well , even though it might be realistic i actually like to be able to understand what people are saying . the acting is alright although dunaway overacts badly & is obviously there for the money . jennifer 's shadow is a rubbishy ghost film that i thought was a total bore from start to finish , i would rather watch the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies ! ! ? ( 1964 ) again instead . a total waste of time .
i have n't seen this movie in a while , so i 'm afraid i ca n't be very specific about details ... it did have some interesting points . ralph bakshi 's attempt at an animated adaptation of j.r.r tolkien 's masterpiece was a very ambitious project , so ambitious in fact that it went bankrupt at some point during the production . therefore , not only does it stop abruptly somewhere around the middle of the second book of the trilogy ( with sort of a shade of a hint of a sequel that was never made ) , the film itself seems less than finished . it seems that some characters were animated while others were filmed , but whether or not it 's intentional is hard to say . the whole thing seems shabbily made and undone , especially the orcs and the nazgul . another problem , of course , is the huge gaps in the plot . bakshi was in a rush to finish this movie , and he somehow hoped to cram a book and a half in little more than two hours ( the new trilogy by peter jackson does it in about twice that time . ) far too many important bits were left out ( and i do n't refer only to tom bombadil , which , i think , was lovely in the book but would look silly in a movie . ) and of course , the ending , which is completely sudden and out of place . i 'm not even sure if bakshi originally intended to end the film there , or if he even had any idea where he 's going to end it . the characters ... well , most of them were okay . the hobbits do n't look so bad ( except for the gay sam . did you know that the producers of the new trilogy originally wanted to make sam a woman so there would be a feminine lead character ? ) if you 're a tolkien fanatic ( like me ) , watch this movie ( though i 'm not too sure about buying it . what special features does the dvd version have , anyway ? ) but know in advance that you 're not going to watch a real 'lord of the rings movie ' but not much more than a historical curiosity , which probably looks not much better than the 60s version would have had the beatles carried on with their plan ( i actually think a psychedelic lotr could have been quite cool . the idea was to cast george as gandalf , paul as frodo , ringo as sam and john as gollum . ) if you did n't read the book or did n't like it much or do n't like animation films or do n't want to see a half-finished movie ... stay away .
i thoroughly enjoyed bilal 's graphic novel when it came out , and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film , and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself . the film , however , was a major letdown . the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks , and the story is poorly told . bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel , and he does n't do a very good job at it , either . the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between nikopol and horus . they were both out of their right time and place , forced together by circumstance . most of all , they were funny and likable . not so here . nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever , and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid . even though the film is french , horus does n't have to be ! we have all seen films we enjoyed , but would n't recommend to everyone , for some reason or other . i would n't recommend immortel to anyone , except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources . bilal 's a master storyteller , but obviously not a master of every visual medium .
i should explain why i gave this ... '' piece of art '' 1 star rating out of possible 10 . simply because it 's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased . probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed . i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so - i think that 's disgusting and pretty terrible ( in all the possible contextual meanings ) , but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called `` historical drama '' - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it ( and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible ) . but the thing about `` historical drama '' genre is that it 's a sub-category of the `` trash movies '' where john romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it ca n't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you ca n't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so , or it was simply bad . it 's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting , bad screenplay and bad everything else . and by some turn of faith - i am one of them too . there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved ! but that 's definitely an opinion of mine and does n't have match with anyones ' else . what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then fellini 's casanova is definitely the choice , but heed my advice and do n't rate it by default means .
well , i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks . it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family , then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie , and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees , etc etc etc ..... they go to that town which no one know it exists ( blah blah blah ) and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you do n't understand what is that movie ! ! ! ! i have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst , honestly it does n't have a description at all and i wish i did n't see it .
rich ditzy joan winfield ( a woefully miscast bette davis ) is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical allen brice ( jack carson looking lost ) . her father ( eugene palette ) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins ( james cagney . seriously ) . they crash land in the desert and hate each other but ( sigh ) start falling in love . this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it . they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why ! the script is just horrible -- there 's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie . the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling rump first in a cactus ( this is done three times ! ) . only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated . as it is they both do their best with the lousy material . cagney tries his best with his lines and davis screeches every line full force but it does n't work . carson has this `` what the hell '' look on his face throughout the entire movie ( probably because his characters emotions change in seconds ) . only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles . but , all in all , this was dull and laughless -- a real chore to sit through . this gets two stars only for cagney and davis ' acting and some beautiful cinematography but really -- it 's not worth seeing . cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why .
it was a decent movie , i actually kind of enjoyed it . but the ending is so abrupt ! ! there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends . what happens after the concert ? what happens with her boyfriend ? does she hook up with grant ? does she come beck in the next semester ? and what about angela ? obviously holly 's performance would knock angela down a few pegs , but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts . there is so much left up in the air and it 's very unsatisfying . i do n't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something , but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke . i was very disappointed .
the dialogue was pretty dreadful . the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents . not visually stunning . actually visually annoying at times . most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button . if you could watch it for free , have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady ... well maybe i 'd recommend it to you , but not anyone else i could think of at the moment .
tarzan the ape man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time , and like that earlier film , it has little resemblance to burroughs ' literary character . but while the 1932 tarzan was reduced to `` tarzan - jane '' speech , this tarzan , played by miles o'keeffe , does n't speak or even grunt . he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times , which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film . no , tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane . or rather , as third banana to bo derek 's left breast and her right breast . this movie has no point but to show derek naked . the two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion , and are really bad . more evidence that no one cared . bizarrely enough , tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film . maybe he car pooled in from sumatra with the indian elephants that are also on display .
this movie looked like it was going to be really funny . i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed . it was very unrealistic . the plot was also pretty weak . i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes were n't even that good . i was also really disappointed with the ending . i would not recommend this movie to anyone .
if this is supposed to be the black experience , let me out at either the front or back door . a mama 's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walk by and from then on it 's all down hill for him . angela bassett , the one shining grace in this film , plays his over protective , religious mother . despite her anger at how his life has turned , by the middle of the picture , she really decides to accept this . she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it 's all right to use the profanity as long as it 's not in front of the children . this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap . you knew where this film was heading . i literally laughed out loud when at the end , when bassett is accompanying her son 's body for burial , she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 , he had become a man . what man ? he had been a convicted criminal , wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity , and scorned society . that scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker , he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools . the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher . the east coast , west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained . all we see are guns blazing . a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence . what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music . the african american community should take umbrage at their very being . who was this classless fat slob who portrayed biggie ? he made rerun from the old television show look thin by comparison . i know it was the streets of bedford stuyvesant that changed this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster that he was . what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment .
there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled `` baby buggy bunny '' that was exactly this plot . baby-faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into bug 's rabbit hole . he dressed up as a baby to get into bugg 's hole to retrieve the money . the scene in `` little man '' where he 's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon . this was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon ; not so much an entire movie . if you are really interested in this , buy the bugs bunny dvd . it 's was much more original the first time ( 1954 ) . plus you 'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot !
the perfectly stupid weapon . i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven segal 's movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie . the plot is predictable , the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene .
spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen . he is the critic 's darling because he supposedly makes films with a `` message '' or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different . summer of sam does not even do that well . the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone , and so is the narrative . the plot is a lot like `` do the right thing '' . the portrayal of `` guidos '' or for the pc set italian-americans ( of which i happen to be one ) is straight out of eddie murphy 's raw . only eddie murphy 's impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much taller african-american is much , much more believable than the cartoonish , broad italian caricatures shown here ( the john leguizamo character being a possible exception ) . is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up ? as soon as richie came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach , i could already see him being accused of being the killer . this character had the most integrity in the whole film so , of course , lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd ( what a white bearded clique ! ) someone please , please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants . so , maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we wo n't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i wo n't have to see critics ( some of them whom i respect ) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor with no clothes .
it aint bad , but it aint good . it is just entertaining . as a comedy which it is supposed to be , it 's dreadful . not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before . it 's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually , but none of them really do much . and the ending sucks .
a half-hearted attempt to bring elvis presley into the modern day , but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-playboy magazine subplot , presley is surrounded by the same old coy , winking clichés . a woman picks e.p . up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life -- and he does n't seem to care ! dick sargent is grueling in another sidebar , but don porter and rudy vallee ( ! ) try hard as elvis ' two bosses ( he 's moonlighting , you see ) . some of the songs are quite good , especially `` almost in love '' , but if you want to see a looser , hipper , updated elvis sex-comedy -- look elsewhere . when elvis and his fatal attraction get into bed together , there 's actually a wooden board in between them ! get real . * * from * * * *
i ended up watching the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on snoop dogg 's appearance ( a passionate fetish of theirs ) on the cover . understandably , i did not expect much . i thought the movie would include the typical array of snoop dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos . however , my generalization was for the most part wrong . unfortunately , this did n't make the movie any better . most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama , whereas i would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick . the film tells a story of two struggling writers ( dylan mcdermott and snoop dogg ) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces . their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship . this friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by snoop 's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder . and although the movie is a drama , the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from snoop and company was more comical than anything else . i would n't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that . there are some mediocre conflicts , but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue . the end , however , jumped at me with a sudden surprise . it was a little bit twisted , somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end . while watching the ending credits i could n't help but picture the director thinking , `` oh god , how the hell do i end this snoozer . '' by the way , the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters .
well , what can you say about a barbara cartland adaptation ? there are some amazing actors in this ( oliver reed , sarah miles , christopher plummer ) but they clearly are clocking up the money . lysette anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics - anthony with hugh grant ( who looks suitably embarrassed ) and gilbert with helena bonham carter . if you really want to see a `` watchable '' adaptation of cartland , the bonham carter one is the one to go for ( `` a hazard of hearts '' - what a title ! ! ) . gilbert is the weak link in that , but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act , and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek ( edward fox & diana rigg )
when a man who does n't have alzheimer 's ca n't remember how many films he 's made , he probably is the world 's most prolific director after all . that man is jesus franco , the king of so-called 'eurotrash ' . his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed , opaque , stupid , lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word ( the film 's title is misleading , for starters ) as any other franco film i 've seen . that makes it sound pretty awful , and it is ... yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility , a generous way with the baldly outrageous , with nudity and sleaze and violence , and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made . the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out , even while you 're mostly waiting for them to end because they 're so very tedious . devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour . the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america . there 's lots of naked writhing , dancing , and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem pole . you need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away , as these are franco 's main methods of extending a film out to feature length . the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary . he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning , apparently recorded in an echo chamber . early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree , and it 's hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach ( or her genitals , sweet jesus ! ) . anyway , the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers . the flakey guy has an accent which , as dubbed , is half brooklyn-american , half english-liverpudlian and all retarded . all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable , making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest . not too much really happens from here on in , and it happens pretty sluggishly , studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape . the nebulous action is fleshed out ( haha ! ) by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads , and even from the monster himself . that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero , but it 's got ta be done at some point , and it 's nice to note that the director will show anyone 's genitals on camera . the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming . franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film-making , but he does n't muck around with sets . you get real islands , jungles , helicopters and mountains , all in widescreen . this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam . ultimately , issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot . if you 're trying to see all the video nasties , you will have to watch this at some point , and you 'll be made as restless as i was . if you like franco , you 'll watch this anyway . if you fall into neither of the above categories , the odds are you 'll never come across this film . copies of it are n't just lying around , and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it . it 's franco . lazy , crazy franco .
the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene . and yet , they can not save this movie . it has so many things going against it - over acting , overly melodramatic , poor script , inconsistent direction ; and too few things going for it - decent music , good cinematography . this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad . please do not judge the rest based on this one film . this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film . my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film .
this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration : sometimes you can wish to be sick ... sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome ... sometimes , for example , you can wish have goldfield syndrome ... that way you 'd not remember this boring movie ... and above all you 'd not remember adam `` superfluos '' sandler ... sometimes , simply , you can wish ... have rented another movie ... my vote ? 3 out of 10 . my suggestion ? if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler ( ... it 's a joke do n't exist adam sandler 's fan ... i want to hope it ) , save yourself ... someone to save ? drew barrymore . ... perhaps .
the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i 've seen in my life . the plot is slow and lacking . the acting is borderline comical . while i love paul muni , i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice . the only saving grace i found with this film is it 's production value . the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment . also , the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time . other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film .
i and a friend rented this movie . we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging . the movie 's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending . we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot .
( i 'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin . ) my dissatisfaction is split : 30 % tone-deafness , 70 % lackluster writing . the 30 % : i agree with the first commenter 's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories . i was surprised how , this film , at best , woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it 's inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl ( this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl ) . a few minority characters are written into the stories , but they are included by obligation , while we can see the gears under the film so clearly , striving to `` be diverse '' but falling ever-so-short . the 70 % is why everything falls short . all characters , white plus a few token minorities , are one-dimensional , cardboard cutouts of people concepts . worse , their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i 'd say is a `` gag '' : we get a basic conceit , then some punchline intended to be a clever twist . but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say , `` okay , that was a surprise '' ... the stories are still not that interesting , because they , too , are shallow . when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending , you 're writing jokes . spoilers below ... the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories . that 's fine . but romance is amazing , deep , sometimes complex . these `` romantic '' stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other . words exchange , thoughts are projected through voice-over , but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another . meaning , there is no seduction ( in the broad sense ) , no tension , and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other . the only story involving a superficial `` seduction '' is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ( ethan hawke ) gets outwitted by the girl he 's hitting on , who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker . sure , his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we 'd be if we were next to them , but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of `` a then b '' . so it unfolds , if something like a postcard could `` unfold '' , with all the other tales as well : a then b -- that 's it , the only point being that these happen to occur `` on set '' in manhattan . by the way , the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch ; the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village . it 's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race , gender , sexual orientation , and so on . _new york , i love you_ , however , deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title . we expect to see the real new york , and real new yorkers , but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic , its characters flown in from the o.c. , plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity . but when we look closer at who those characters are , the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent . for example , the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park , who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny ( male nanny ) when in fact he 's the father . notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic-construction point of view ( it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend/stepfather are strutting the girl away ) , it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl 's father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer . what , the dad ca n't be just some guy from south america ? now that he 's obviously hot , is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle-to-upper-class white woman ? are we that naive as to require such ? as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable . it 's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone . but in every conceivable set-up and plot twist , the direction taken screams status quo , appeals to safety . all these stories could have been made more interesting , even if we were forced to keep the single-dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them , at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes . asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy ? how 'bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead . again , i 'm not saying the entire conceit has to be changed . it 's just that every . damn . story premise . is so hackneyed -- and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york , outside the trite . the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading . i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack , the good pacing of the movie ( even if what was being paced was , well , dredge ) , and the general feel of many of the scenes . the movie was just fine to sit through , and i would n't dissuade anyone from doing so . however , it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says ( paraphrased ) `` that 's what i love about new york : everyone 's from a different place . '' well , you would n't know it from watching this one .
jim belushi is having a mid life crisis , nothing is going right , when his car goes out on him .. he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently .. a good premise with some moments .. but mostly flat and uninteresting . on a scale of one to ten .. 3
virgin is selected to marry rich guy . rich guy urinates . woman on boat likes sailor . sailor urinates . virgin attends gross-out commune dinner . man urinates on dinner table . boatwoman does strip tease for little boys . man pretending to be baby urinates . there is an underlying theme here . makavejev is trying to say that he is pi $ $ ed off at the world . to say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement . to justify the title , there is a scene where laure , who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie , bathes in chocolate syrup . it is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one 's mouth unless one happens to share the director 's fetishes .
italian-born eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover karl , an ultra-modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods . it 's winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker leslie , who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house , but also that of eleonora , as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair . what was i expecting ? a thriller indeed , but it was n't quite so . that 's just the advertising on the package for ya ! i 'm quite perplex about everything . the title , the story and the motivation . so how to classify it ? well , this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound-story of alienation , possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals . co-writer ( along with william dafoe ) and director giada colagrande 's art-house film is just too clinical , distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story , which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean although when its sudden conclusion materialises , you 'll thinking why should i actually care . what we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images . sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments , but more so make for an leaden experience , as it never delves deep enough . like it believes it does . the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic . they are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow . the base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh , but it 's never fulfilling and i thought there 'll be more to it then all of this dreary lingering . colagrande 's direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines , but everything feels like it 's in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views . most of the action stays at the one location the house . camera-work is potently taut , but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes . giada colagrande plays it sensually and william dafoe sleep walks the part . he looks dog tired ! while seymour cassel , pokes his head in now and then . just where is it heading , is anyone 's guess . well , that 's if you can wait around for it . i think i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt , as it 's definitely not what i was expecting from this indie film .

ok , plain and simple , if you are a fan of the other tomb raider games ( yes , even aod ) keep away from legend . it is , without doubt , the most disappointing tr game yet . it looks very nice , it sounds very nice , but it is totally unplayable and i 've given up . i feel like i 've been robbed by eidos . it 's very simple . tr was a pc game before anything else . you control lara using the keyboard . in 6 tomb raider games the controls were standard . in aod they were 'tacky ' , but still the same general control sequences . in legend they have changed her movement and control methods completely and she is totally uncontrollable . i have seen comments elsewhere from people who say 'use the mouse ' . no , why should i ? others say 'use a gamepad ' . no , why should i ? others say 'but this has been the standard for 3rd person controls for years ' well , i do n't care , it is not the standard for any other tr game so why mess with it . oh , i know , because they could n't care less about their original , loyal fan base , they want to cash in on the new kids who had n't even heard of the series until the movies came out and make lots more money . pathetic . my advice to any serious tr fan is keep away from this game , and if you do buy it complain to eidos . i have seen masses of other posts , mainly on the eidos forums , from people telling them how rubbish it is , perhaps they will listen .
... except for jon heder . this guy tanked the entire movie . the plot sounded entertaining . a 29 year old slacker son ( heder ) still lives with widowed mom ( keaton ) who happens to meet a new love ( daniels ) . slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship . he also meets a girl ( faris ) . i really liked the performance of daniels and especially faris but whoever casted hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach . heders performance is annoying , which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy , problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale . at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you 're upset about the end . in the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me !
warning ! small plot details revealed ! i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film . it is written so badly that every character is a caricature , yet it seems to take itself seriously . it is poorly cast , especially ralph macchio ( all baby-faced , 5-foot-nothing of him ) as a streetwise tough . plot elements are all drawn in black and white , with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax . most egregious of all ( plot element about to be revealed ) it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi-serious film . one can just imagine the filmmakers saying , `` we need jobeth to shed her top ... hmmm ... i 've got it ! ... early in the film , let 's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways ... then jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the hallway ... yeah , that 's the ticket ! '' i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 , one that proved all too weighty in the late 90 's with events like columbine . however , the execution is dreadful . this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of `` heathers '' , a campy political statement like `` network '' or a serious examination like `` brubaker '' . instead , it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things . `` teachers '' get an f .
pam grier stars as coffy . she 's a nurse who seeks revenge , on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine . like any 70s blaxploitation flick , you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts . there were scores of these films made during the 70s , and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike . this is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films , and the degrading , stereotypical characters . especially the female characters . other common threads between coffy , and other films of its type , include brutal violence , corrupt cops , car chases , a generous abundance of nudity , and sex-crazed gorgeous women . not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers , pimps , mobsters , and other criminal scum . pam grier , was the undisputed queen of 70s blaxploitation heroines . she was magnificent , being both tough-as-nails , and drop-dead gorgeous . like in her other films , pam outshines the other characters , in coffy . in fact , pam is so charismatic on screen , that these sorts of films are unwatchable , without her as the main character . if you like pam grier , you 're better off seeing her other films , like foxy brown , or perhaps friday foster . these films have much less empty sleaze , than coffy does . pam 's character in coffy , degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys . pam 's characters in her other blaxploitation films , do n't stoop as low to get revenge , as coffy did . i 'd say , only watch coffy , if you 're unable to see any of pam grier 's other films . otherwise , coffy is a waste of time . only pam 's talent as an actress , makes viewing coffy bearable .
i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one . edward furlong , you 're not as good as you think mate , you ca n't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap , which sole intention has to be to get some bucks . the filming is bad , and i mean bad . anyone with a camera would get the same result , or better . the acting , lets just say : do n't go to the supermarket looking for actors . the good ones usually come with a degree or , at least , have some damn experience ! the director .. mr. jon keeyes , please find your purpose in life , as a director you simply suck . your directing is poor , the angles are all messed up ( not in a good way ) , the lines seem as if they 're being read out of toilet paper , and the damn music .. it always comes up when it should n't and goes out for no apparent reason . and do n't go for writer either , by the way . making movies is n't like serving on a coffeshop , it requires art and skill , things i really doubt you 'll ever have . instead of making a badass shootout movie , you should 've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up .. or just go find a job on a coffeshop . you 'll have less stress and you 'll save movie goers some money and a bad night . vote : 1/10 ( my first one )
... but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time . and that takes some doing , what with the likes of various lifetime efforts . do n't get me wrong -- i have nothing against cicely tyson . i 've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles ( look at sipsey in fried green tomatoes , for example ) . but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery . and chew it she does , with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas goose . give me the classics anytime : alastair sim , 1951 . with the exception maybe of scrooged , all the others are just over-the-top efforts to grasp the past , present , or future spirit of christmas .
wow . rarely have i felt the need to comment on movies lately , but this one especially is begging for a beatdown . let 's start at the beginning . first , writer-director susan montford puts kim basinger in the tired old victim role , complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence . let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite . montford 's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the christmas tree with no star is laughable . when she goes out for some christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night , della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year . she decides to do something about it , so she leaves a nasty note on the car 's windshield . the next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall . when she finally gets to her car , the thugs confront her about the note , a cop is killed , and she runs , and they catch up to her , and she gets away , and they chase her some more , and on and on . everything is completely predictable and uninvolving . the thugs are not scary or menacing at all , and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways . this is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine . why the bad guys do n't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me . and once , just once , in a film like this , does the leader of the pack have to die last ? what does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ? much of the movie simply consists of lukas haas running around in the woods screaming `` della ! ! ! '' and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting . the part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when della , exhausted and hurt , cries out to the heavens , `` where are you , god ? '' where , indeed , was god when this movie was being made ? i give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting , and it 's not as bad as 'btk killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film . cheers !
look , i 'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this , but life is confusing enough . i do n't need to watch it that way . i dig anthony hopkins , big time . i even watched fracture , and i knew that would be a steaming pile of quentin . but this thing is not well shot , and it 's not daring -- even if it is artsy . well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits , not this `` oh , but it 's a realistic interpretation '' excuse . this thing 'll make your head hurt . it 's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all . i still love ah , and i 'll always give him another chance , but if you are n't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen , skip this .
edwin porter 's 1903 short film entitled `` the great train robbery '' bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film . just like melies ' `` a trip to the moon '' , critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema . in my eyes , they were right . it had everything from the planning , the actual heist of the train , the murder of an unwanted civilian , and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time . from here to eastwood , every western filmmaker has used porter 's image in some form or another to create their own story . one can not say that this film did n't open the door , but the struggle comes from the story itself . the genre was defined by porter , but outside of its initial excitement  there really is n't anything to grapple onto . perhaps i am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages , but how can something be cliché before being cliché ? to me , `` the great train robbery '' seemed forced , untraceable , and unsurprising . unlike melies , porter tells a very linear story . robbers change the course of a train , rob it , then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains , and the final scene ends like any predestined film , without any surprises or glitches , and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face . it is bland . porter 's film is boring . in the edition i watched , there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion , which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker , or to the viewer . the issue remains that while it is important , porter 's film has been borrowed time and time again , it has in effect become diluted . the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has . unlike melies early film , i can not watch this again . i know what has happened , i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes , and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c. this issue is not only my gripe with this film , but also the strongest element to see in such an early film . while it was dull , the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives , was outstanding to see . in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream , this broke the mold . again , not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just is n't a great film . overall , i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted , but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind . porter is a talented director , and g.m . anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field , but i just was n't in awe of the film . i was n't expecting big budget effects like melies work , nor was i expecting a duplicate of `` a trip to the moon '' , but i did want to see the same creativity , exploration , and originality . i felt porter played it safe , if that can be said with such an early film , but i could n't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds . i was n't rooting for anyone , and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy-ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started . it was pioneering , but not monumental . `` the great train robbery '' has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema . grade : * * out of * * * * *
this is pretty much a low-budget , made for tv , type of movie intended to capitalize off of the success of the original . i 'm a fan of b-movies , and this one might have been good had they not attached the name `` cube '' to it , because as is , the director and plot of the original were better , and this movie just about ruined my taste for the entire series . the characters are annoying and clichéd , there are problems with continuity , and several outright production screw-ups . the story hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from that . they more or less use the same horror gimmicks over and over throughout the movie , and because the first one was so good , this simply turns out as a disappointment . if this was a stand-alone b-movie , i 'd probably give it about a four . the `` 1 '' rating i give it was pretty much a statement about how it utterly paled in effects and intelligence as compared to the first .
slow , boring , extremely repetitive . no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this . this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself , and quit producing . there is no way you can watch this and enjoy . the preacher is a joke . the whole idea is not funny . you can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature . i am so sorry i rented this movie . i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it . it is completely garbage . filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal . the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products , making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy .
as is often the case , films about self-loathing characters do not usually make for good drama . 'downloading nancy ' is no exception . it 's supposedly based on a true story about a woman who 's murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet . the protagonist is nancy ( maria bello ) who is married to albert ( rufus sewell ) . albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar/restaurants . unlike most human beings , albert has virtually no positive attributes ( except for his ability to be successful in the business world ) . throughout the film , albert has a grim and dour expression on his face . he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes . when his wife asks for sex , he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead . nancy is equally one-note as a character . not only has she had a loveless 15 year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up ( thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film ) . her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result , she 's forced into therapy . however , she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made . finally , nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet . he 's sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo , who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot . it 's revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them ( the children 's mother no longer wants anything to do with him ) . nancy 's plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her . there 's a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass . these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club . it seems that louis has a two-fold plan in going to see albert : 1 ) berate him for his treatment of nancy and 2 ) enjoy the beating he receives . it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy 's fatefirst , he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future . nancy 's fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death ( but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some 'feelings ' for her ) . we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy 's murder . what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy ? are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence ? is that the main point of the film ? is sympathy for nancy actually warranted ? i do n't think so . the film 's writers create a straw man in the character of albertsomeone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy 's decline . but are people so one-dimensional in real life ? i think not . they have the repulsive louis , a man who makes a living by inflicting pain , come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy . furthermore , his expressions of love towards nancy ( before he kills her ) , is supposed to show his 'sensitive side ' . in the end , it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film . they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence , that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography .
i had high expectations of this movie ( the title , translated , is `` how we get rid of the others '' ) . after all , the concept is great : a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing government 's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general , and decided to just kill off everyone who can not prove that they 're contributing something to the establishment ( the establishment being called `` the common good '' , but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology ) . very cool idea ! ideal for biting satire ! only , this movie completely blows its chance . the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity , but this satire is not sustained ; it is neither sharp nor witty . and for an alleged comedy , the movie has nearly no funny scenes . the comedy , i assume , is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations , but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious , rather than evoking either laughter or thought . the script is rife with grave errors in disposition . the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing , but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun , and who 's trying to save everybody , by organizing a resistance that ships people to africa . all this is beside the point ! a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious ! it 's a satire ! a political statement . but it does n't even begin to actually address the problem it 's supposed to be about . maybe it was afraid of going too far ? how cowardly . that 's not art . it 's not even real satire . søren pilmark , a very serious and by now one of denmark 's absolutely senior actors , was very good . he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had . everybody else : nothing special ( well , perhaps except for lene poulsen , who did supply a convincing performance ) . in fact , a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural . neither the formulation nor the delivery . why is it so difficult to make it sound right ? why must it be so stilted and artificial ? i hope , when people look at these movies fifty years from now , they do n't think that this was how people talked in general danish society . 3 out of 10 .
normally i 'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies , but this movie is the exception . some how this movie got into my mind ! ! ! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective , it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments , the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout . another seen was the family photo i was n't expecting that and i jumped out my seat ! ! ! i would recommend everyone to see this movie , with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time ! ! ! ! !
`` it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable . '' and for good reason : they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman . and let 's not kid ourselves : critics were mostly supportive of allen 's bergman pretensions , allen 's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . what i do n't get is this : why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman , but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for `` ripping off '' hitchcock in his suspense/horror films ? in robin wood 's view , it 's a strange form of cultural snobbery . i would have to agree with that .
i have nothing against a fast-paced fright-flick , but this stephen king-derived nonsense is too freshly-scrubbed , too bright and modern . the plot , about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a `` sleepwalker '' -- sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf -- and who feeds on the blood of female virgins , begs for a more mysterious , ambiguous treatment . this thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel , with hardly any atmosphere . the kids are predictably pretty and energetic , but the big plus is alice kridge as the boy 's mother ; kridge , from `` ghost story '' , never broke out of the filler-female mold , and it 's a huge loss that she has n't been used more . her performance is creepy and intense , and gives hint that `` sleepwalkers '' might 've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction . it 's too over-the-top and commercially-driven , with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama . stephen king pops up in a cameo , as do real-life directors john landis and tobe hooper . * 1/2 from * * * *
if you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters , this is the one . the acting is superb , both from john cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom , as the saying goes , they really are out to get , and from peter falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue . big mistake , but since they 're both amoral mobsters , and misogynistic bastards to boot , it 's hard to decide whom to root for less . only writer/director elaine may could have gotten away with this one . i thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer michael hausman included on the dvd , he disclosed that the two stars had `` very different ideas '' about the script , that the director was nearly impossible to work with , that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him , that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting , and so on . this mood of one big very dysfunctional family comes across clearly on the screen .
the original `` les visiteurs '' was original , hilarious , interesting , balanced and near perfect . lv2 must be a candidate for `` worst first sequel to a really good film '' . in lv2 everyone keeps shouting , when a gag does n't work first it 's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny . lv2 is a horrible parody of lv1 , except of course that a parody should be inventive . if you loved lv1 just do n't see this film , just see lv1 again ! !
john hughes wrote a lot of great comedies in the '80s . `` european vacation '' is not one of them . the follow-up to hughes ' first big hit `` vacation '' ( 1983 ) , is about as predictable , unfunny and annoying as they come -- no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic clark and ellen griswold ( chase and d'angelo ) . i greatly enjoyed `` vacation '' as well as the third film , 1989 's `` christmas vacation , '' but the griswold 's trip to europe is bland and forced . perhaps because this was hughes ' first attempt at a sequel that he did n't get it , but it 's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story `` european vacation '' is . there is no through story : the griswolds win a game show for being `` greedy little pigs '' and go on a tour of europe through england , france , germany and italy . even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming , which is part director amy heckerling 's fault . the `` fast times at ridgemont high '' director sets everything up too predictably . maybe it was hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel . `` european vacation '' takes great pride in insulting americans ( recall the greedy little pig game show they win ) , especially tourists , represented by the cornball griswold family . it also pats itself on the back implicitly saying `` oh us griswolds , we 're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot . '' then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to america and how grateful the griswolds are to return to such a better country . if hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie , well maybe i should award this 8/10 stars . it 's not just the unfunniness , but `` european vacation '' boasts the two worst actors to play kids rusty and audrey ( jason lively and dana hill ) . they 're both annoying and obnoxious , with the unattractive and loud-mouthed audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she 's left behind nearly the entire film . hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst . quite tasteful . speaking of , breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason ( unless it was to comment on americans ' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies ) . i will give the film one of its two stars thanks to eric idle of the monty python crew , whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from `` holy grail '' is about the funniest part . if hughes intended for us to find one of the film 's only non- american actors as the only funny part , then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of hollywood comedy in the '80s . still , would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining ?
this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning ww ii codes being broken , stolen , etc . the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm `` b '' actors . one big caution . jean rogers , who did such a great job playing the very sexy dale arden in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie . her character is extremely annoying . she absolutely never lets-up with her overacting . we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility , she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function . from that standpoint i 'm sorry that i ever watched this film . it has forever changed my perception of ms. rogers . talentwise , she is an extreme lightweight . lee bowman is his usual self , meaning that he is merely adequate .
this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd . the print is not great , nor is the sound , but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or so minutes to spare , you 'll get your money 's worth ( which is not saying an awful lot ) . anna neagle is extremely vapid as nanette . whatever her charms may have been back in the day , they are not evident in this film . a great number of fine character actors appear in this film ( helen broderick , zasu pitts , even arden ) , but the material falls remarkably short of their talents . still , it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing . the musical numbers ( there are really only two ) are quite horrible . clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original `` no , no , nanette '' . for what it 's worth , the dvd can be had for $ 1.00 . it 's worth that much just to say you 've seen it .
`` smithereens '' is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library . a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman , the film is fraught with bad acting , bad sound , bad camera work , and poor quality in all aspects of the film . many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life 's great mysteries . ( d- )
have i seen a worse movie ? perhaps only `` manos : the hands of fate '' dragged more than `` dukes '' . i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point . let 's touch on a few ... there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they do n't respond . he shrugs and moves on , since neither the knoxville or scott know what he 's talking about ( nor do we ) . it was like the engine died and was restarted . the few times the general lee flew through the air were n't even that exciting . nothing i have n't seen on the tv series . very little chemistry between knoxville and scott . the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked . the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it ( although roughly ) . the rest of the time it seems distant and forced . seann william scott 's awful , horrendous accent ( or lack thereof ) . i hated willie nelson 's performance . were bad jokes supposed to be endearing ? i wanted him to disappear . jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen . she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film . that 's telling you how horrible this movie is . she 's a goddess . during the climax of the film , i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county , starting with willie nelson and his accomplices . a nuclear bomb would have sufficed . this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film , but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film . if only we could erase and start over ...
this 'movie ' has to be the biggest pile of steaming c * ^p i have ever seen , what more can i say than bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad . there is nothing to save this 'movie ' and i pray that they never even talk about making a sequel . if you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth . movies like men in black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this 'comedy ' but have totally failed . please avoid this movie , ( save yourself ) .
deceptive advertising ... i saw a commercial for carlitos way : rise to power that states `` from the producer of scarface and carlito 's way '' lets get it straight ... michael bergman did not produce scarface , in fact he was 'editing room assistant ' for scarface . not to take away from bergman 's talent ... but in my opinion he should of had a little more class . i think i can speak for the masses when i say ... we hate being blatantly lied to . as far as the movie goes , it was poor at best . i did think puff daddy did a good job . although , luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film . overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlito 's way . it 's obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film .
never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films ! bob fosse 's `` star 80 '' about dorothy stratten , of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband , is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen . patty hansen is no actress either .. i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful `` poodlesque '' hair-do .... very disappointing .... '' paper moon '' and `` the last picture show '' i could watch again and again . this clunker i could barely sit through once . this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms. stratten 's tawdry death ; i think the real reason was because it was so bad !
a patient escapes from a mental hospital , killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college . next semester , the late prof 's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings . the dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes . this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80 's . despite killing the heroine off , this is just substandard junk . horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , horrible horrible horrible ! ! `` splatter university '' is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do , although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape , that would be more entertaining . skip it and rent `` girl 's nite out '' instead . rated r for strong graphic violence , profanity , brief nudity and sexual situations .
this kiyoshi kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild , and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard . but all in all , the movie is incredibly stupid , with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer , only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes . then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous asian lady ghost , and has no idea why ( and neither does the viewer ) . as other murders are committed , he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found , and this ghost still haunts him for some reason . not only is the plot completely stupid , the lady ghost is more funny than anything , especially when she suddenly flies across the city , like wonder woman . and the ending makes little sense , in fact , the whole movie makes little sense , and i ca n't recommend it at all . if it did n't take itself so serious , i would think it was supposed to be a black comedy . outside of `` bright future '' this is the worst movie directed by kiyoshi kurosawa i have seen yet .
buford 's beach bunnies gives b-grade t & a films a bad name . as a fan of the genre , i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents . i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes . what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think ?
i did n't really expect much from `` the night listener '' and i actually never heard of it until i saw the cover in the videostore . however , the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension . on occasion it drags a little , but it actually helps to keep you wondering what 's going to happen and more importantly : when . as the movie progresses , the character played by robin williams gets dragged into some kind of `` cat and mouse '' spiel to the point where he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth and existence about a 14 year old abused kid that no-one seemed to have ever seen in person . the night listener is an interesting story , which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie and you 're pretty much kept in the dark of who is lying and what 's real . however , in the end it kind of disappoints and does n't live up to the potential it could have had . it does n't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character , which would have been helpful and interesting .
one of the worst romantic comedies ( nay , worst movies ) i 've ever seen . boy ( who works as a phone psychic ! ) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams . hilarity does not ensue . boredom , light gay-bashing , and horrible dialogue do . if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue , you 'll like this movie . be smart . avoid this . if you see it , destroy the copy .
i 've seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer ! for a school-film is very well produced and directed , but the story ... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film . the character named tim watcher needed some in-dept approach . this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films - the script is always superficial . but still ... i liked this movie ... parabens ! ( congratulations ! )
this is truly terrible : painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose , no beginning , middle or end , cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention , all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable `` story '' . what makes it worse is the film 's pretentions to `` style '' : suddenly a remote-head crane shot spirals downwards , and , without any apparent reason there are sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held sections : all this `` style '' merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material . definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made .
for the record , this film is intriguing but its hardly original . back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters . the story is amanda lear has had a bad life , abusive father , horny doctor , mental homes , etc . she 's finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy . ( now that was original ) the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard . after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard , who just happens to be married to a blues singer . if you 've seen the landlady you know the rest , she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard ( including a roadie ) . much of the idea 's came from the previous movie , same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in , same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn , same flying a bodypress . it did have some original material , the beer bottle thing was brutal . the highlight of the movie was amanda 's beautiful breasts in the hot-top scene . somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time . 4 out of 10
this movie was a rather odd viewing experience . the movie is obviously based on a play . now i 'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just does n't feel terribly interesting enough to watch . the movie is way too 'stagey ' and they did n't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie . instead what is presented now is an almost literally re-filming of a stage-play , with over-the-top characters and staged dialog . because of all this the storyline really does n't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience . it takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you 're watching . at first you think its a drama you 're watching , with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you 'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy , that leans really more toward the comedy genre , rather than the drama genre . the characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over-the-top one that at times really become unwatchable . sure , the actors are great ; peter o'toole and susannah york , amongst others but they do n't really uplift the movie to a level of 'watchable enough ' . the story feels totally disorientated . basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother/sister characters played by peter o'toole and susannah york . but what exactly is the story even about ? the movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer . like i said before ; i 'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really is n't fitting and simply does n't work out . the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences . more was to expect from director j. lee thompson , who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed , stage-play translated to screen , project . really not worth your time . 4/10
i 'll keep this fast and sweet . five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a 'short cut ' that leads them down a deserted forest-ridden road . of course nothing but good things happen to them , and they safely arrive at their destination . alright , they do n't . soon they 're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues , and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom . i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again . their screaming , screeching voices gave me a headache , and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming . all in all , one of the worst cheap horror flicks i 've ever seen ... and i 've seen a lot .
... or an audience . a quick recap .... so you 've got this doctor who 's been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason . he wants to perfect transplants , but feels he needs to do this in his basement . wtf ? ? ? and then suddenly , unfortunately , and conveniently , his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that he 's responsible for . agonized with grief , he preserves her head in a lasagna pan ( or is it strudel ? ) and pumps it full of `` adreno-serum '' ( sic ) to keep it alive . and then she awakes , talking her head off ( so to speak ) even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords , and she has no lungs so she could n't speak even if she had 'em . seems the ungrateful b * tch does n't appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her . just like a woman ..... then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved 's head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street . meanwhile , the doctor 's assistant , a sort of dime-store igor , gets into philosophical arguments with the head , who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the `` monster in the closet '' ( every mad scientist has one ) . eventually the screenwriter realizes that he ca n't keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum , so he kills everybody , then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie 's financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it . have i mentioned that i think this is a bad movie ? someone should tell turner classic movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff . the sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off , pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious .
a fun concept , but poorly executed . except for the fairly good makeup effects , there 's really not much to it . there are obvious problems ; for example , after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size , the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days ... and once he 's deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time . in any case , the movie has far worse problems than that -- the cinematography is decidedly low-budget-tv-show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around . robert john burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling charlton heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that lucinda jenney and kari wuhrer are both even worse . the only reason why i 'm giving this movie as high as i am is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or so and joe mantegna 's character takes over , the movie develops a fun , campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse ' feel , and the gangster 's crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch . the ending , if predictable , is also nicely mean . avoid unless you 're a king-o-phile or are really psyched up at the idea of the voice of fat tony from the simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp .
the only reason i do n't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it is n't quite on par with a movie like manos : the hands of fate . this movie 's greatest crime is the fact that it is head-meltingly boring & terribly , unforgivably british . the premise of this movie sounds potentially promising , the whole teleporting concept , but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting . it was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers . the actors were wooden , unemotional , and aloof . as was the love affair between the two scientists -- which was anything but intriguing . i never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non-existent . nor did i really understand why the melty-faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met . at least now i know that i should always give someone a fair hearing before i cut off their research grants , else they go rampaging about , killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures .
i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times . in addition , i 'm also shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter . however , after watching it , i was extremely disappointed . the movie 's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous . the director lingered on certain scenes for much too long . there was no passion or chemistry between the lovers . there was barely any dialogue . dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting . at the end of the movie , you did n't feel any compassion for the characters . this movie was lacking in everything . the script was weak , the acting was poor , and the editing was non-existent . the director tried to emulate certain noir film styles but failed miserably . a good movie is one in which captures your attention , maintains it and is successful in concluding without you feeling time has passed by . this movie felt as though it would never end . do n't waste your money on this movie .
this had to be one of the worst films ever . when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping ... so hollywood . another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement . andie 's acting is so bad in this film - i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other . the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie . anyway this was such a campy movie . i usually like these type of films but i just could n't get into this film . too many unlikely situations and again andie 's acting did n't help the film . also , she is all gums . lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals .
* * * spoilers * * * with a gathering of family members and servants of the late christopher dean , john carradine , to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the dean fortune , some 140 million dollars . the money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the dean mansion . there seemed to have been a mix-up in the story when we later find out that it 's really an overnight sleepover , not a weeks vacation , at the mansion for the guests to qualify for dean 's money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise . the first victim of the dean curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed christopher dean estate the local sheriff dan garcia , rodolfo acosta . acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests . later that evening cute little chin greg and laura 's , jeff morrow & marry anders , little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond . the movie has all the people staying at the dean mansion being picked off one by one until it 's revealed who the killer really is . we then have what seems to be a double-twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest . the real killer ends up not only getting all the loot , 140 million dollars , but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him , or her , in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot . nonsensical who done it , and haunted house , movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother , much less the audience , would have trouble liking . there 's everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest s & m sadism and of course double-dealing and back-stabbing not even counting murder . you just could n't care less who of the guests survives to collect the dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do . even the big surprise at the end is n't really that much of a surprise since the killer 's identity is divulged with the film-maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself ! we then have a plot-twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is . the final plot-twist , that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away , was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie .
this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours . someone please tell me what the point was ? i mean , i understand the historical setting . it 's supposed to be about a ragtag group of confederate bushwhackers ( terrorists ? ) on the missouri-kansas frontier , taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the u.s. civil war . but aside from gratuitous violence there was n't really much of a point to this movie . perhaps it was a political statement ? that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence ? if that was the point it was done quite well , but i do n't think that was the point . i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here , but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot . it seemed like i was watching a paperback novel come to life , with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels . this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched !
i just finished reading a book on anita loos ' work and the photo in tcm magazine of macdonald in her angel costume looked great ( impressive wings ) , so i thought i 'd watch this movie . i 'd never heard of the film before , so i had no preconceived notions about it whatsoever . thought it got off to a cute start with eddy as the playboy and macdonald as the secretary he does n't know exists . the scene where she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that wo n't stay on was really endearing . i was even with the film when eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel . but after a while it just started to fall apart for me . eddy stays `` asleep '' for the entire rest of movie , so it 's all a dream . whatever happens from there on does n't really matter , because he 's just dreaming . the rest of it was pretty much plot less and pointless . i had to force myself to stick with it . and the final number where macdonald goes from musical number to musical number in some mad hallucination was just plain freaky . had eddy `` woken '' a sooner and the original story continued , or had he really married an angel , i think it would have been a lot more interesting . i wanted to see more of her real character . there were n't really enough musical numbers to call it a musical . the first few songs were good , but the jitterbug number that macdonald performs was like nails on a chalkboard . completely wrong for her operatic voice . even so , eddy and macdonald still manage to shine , showing what true stars they were .
do n't even bother with this movie , it 's bad when judged on it 's own merits , but when compared to the 1972 original ( which is a classic ) it 's down right awful . and btw , somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book . this is silly , movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from . they are 2 completely different art forms ( as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does ) . if you used this criteria for all movies then `` 2001 '' would suck and so would `` forest gump '' and `` silence of the lambs '' .
honestly i am not even joking when i say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen ! this film dose n't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line . i can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from `` the omen '' and other movies like it . for example the nanny `` lucy '' in this film is actually one of the devil 's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of satan ..... does this sound a lot like mrs. baylock to anyone else . another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted , just like in `` the omen '' . however luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body .... yet another coincidence ? ? ? ? ? ? and to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of jesus all over the walls , much like the priest in `` the omen '' having pages of the bible plastered on the walls like wall-paper . please do n't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and `` the omen '' for you because as i 've stated above there are far too many to mention here .
i love seth green . his appearances on that 70s ' show is always worth watching but last night , i felt the show needed to overhauled . four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for . the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place . so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out . anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable . i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show 's set up . there did not seem to be much humor in it . i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night . i think they should go back , scrap this series , and start over . we need more family involved series . how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down . they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook , play the mother and dysfunctional siblings . the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it .
i do n't know why i 'm commenting this stupid reality-show i happened to watch a few episodes of ( a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something , i did n't watch the entire thing though.only like three episodes ) as i was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day.maybe i 'm just bored today : - ) i feel sorry for britney , i really do.for all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity.or she 's self-centered to the extreme.she married the nitwit federline ( okay anybody can make a mistake ) and before that she `` starred '' this horrible show about her everyday life with him , where she shoves a camcorder wherever she feels like it , no matter if it is in someone 's face or into the shower as federline is standing in there . she 's babbling about her sex-life without leaving anything to your imagination , i do n't care for my part , but i ca n't help wondering how she feels about it now when she 's divorced.and yes , for her sake i 'm embarrassed.but i should n't be.she seem to live a pretty empty , shallow life though.i do n't want to swap lives with her even if i could . road-kill tv if you like .
as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser , i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released . sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again , but it was no better the second time . mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer , but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester . the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers ' for me and the same applies here . to me , the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong . the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts , but they are adventure novels . there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all , he is involved in dangerous situations . this is conveyed in the novels , but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style . it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book . when i first read that the book was to be filmed , the article said that the film was to star oliver reed . i rejoiced , as reed to me was the epitome of flashman . how i would have loved to see him in the role . malcolm mcdowell is a good actor , but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books ( too scrawny looking ! flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow ) . neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck . what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy . the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet ( tom bell ) . a great shame , as the production values , costumes , sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell . possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is , as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom ' , adapted by mr fraser , worked quite well . perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen .
by now you should already know about this film , the jessica simpson `` bomb '' that pretty much went straight to video ( limited , anemic theatrical run ) . basically , ms. simpson 's katie travels from a small town in oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman . she is stranded , but has one friend ( rachel leigh cook , whom i wish we saw more often in film ) , who lets her stay . katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers ( penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy dick ) who are just using katie to get the president of the firm ( larry miller ) ousted . this is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound . jessica simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying . the film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff . in a cameo , penny marshall is funny ( a subtle in-joke about milwaukee made me chuckle ) , and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests ( do n't read too much into this ) . so , not horrible , but easy to skip . your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does . again , not good , but not a profound disaster .
what a terrible film . it starts well , with the title sequence , but that 's about as good as it gets . the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree . the acting is n't so much poor , but the script is pointless and the film is n't even scary despite the atmospheric music . it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film . it is n't a good film . it 's trash , and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it ! one out of ten .
from a plot and movement standpoint , this movie was terrible . i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did . basically , five characters appear in the movie , a son & father , son 's girl friend , and two male characters of the son 's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation . the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism , but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another . there were a couple of brilliant scenes . at the beginning of the movie , the son 's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation . the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two , ending with her admitting to having another man who was `` older '' . end of that story .
a childless couple ( brooke adams , jeff hayenga ) go to a doctor ( james karen ) to try to conceive . it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there 's something seriously wrong with the baby ... pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script -- the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end . i saw every `` twist '' coming . the direction is poor -- he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene . the production values are -- to be nice -- lousy . very shabby . and , the gore scenes are too unpleasant ( i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach ) with lousy special effects . the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film . some good acting makes it somewhat bearable . adams , hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it . this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown -- it 's easy to see why . i give it a 4 .
a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating . the premise seems simple enough : yentl , a girl interested in studying the talmud , wants to go to school . but only boys are allowed to study , so after her father 's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in . she does and becomes close friends with avigdor , who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass . hadass ' family learns avigdor 's brother committed suicide , and the wedding is called off . yentl , now calling herself anschel , is then selected to marry hadass . she does but it is never consummated . yentl/anschel and avigdor go away for a few days , and yentl/anschel reveals her secret to him . the movie ends with avigdor returning to ( and marrying ? ) hadass , and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise . the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long , but there are several things that ruin it . for starters , there is the constant singing . ( i can already hear the critics shouting . ) yes , i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers . but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them . the songs become tedious after a while , and there is n't as much dancing as one would expect . many of the songs are forgettable , with no real memorable lyrics , and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over . only one song stands out from the rest , `` papa can you hear me '' . it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes . chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is , so the songs really are n't necessary . second , streisand 's makeup , which can be seen during her scenes as a man ( the lipstick , enhanced lashes , and traces of blush are all obvious ) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl/anschel character , that she is actually serious , and fooling her new friends , colleagues , and even hadass , into believing she is a man . yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing . there seems to be a contradiction , as her character talks , or rather sings , of how she does n't think she can pull it off , but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men 's clothing . this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they ca n't see the other differences , such as her actions , which are clear giveaways . the facial differences alone can not be included , as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends did n't have a beard or other facial hair . nevertheless , in the 1900s , if a woman dressed as a man , but wore as much makeup as streisand 's character did , and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men 's clothing , it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage . chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town , or even the country . therefore the `` feminine '' makeup on streisand does not lend to the character 's credibility , and only weakens the plot . if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful , it should have been scrapped . thirdly , when yentl/anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end , we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as streisand 's and only when they learn the `` truth '' do they become a little wiser . by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for streisand to fuel . lastly , there are those who are fans of streisand who will find no fault with this film , its plot , or the songs . to those i must respectfully disagree . while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities , i am not a `` fan '' of her style of singing . however , i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals . there are even some songs of hers that i like , so i am not a `` hater '' nor have set out to bash her . i have written this review from an honest perspective , from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within . if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film , she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented , beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn . this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities , make her appear self-absorbed , and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience .
i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out , since i was a huge snl fan . when my boyfriend and i went to see it , the people coming out of the early show were yelling , `` do n't waste your money ! '' but of course we had to find out for ourselves . while there were a few funny bits ( laser bra 2000 , root boy slim ) , most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing 1 hour show . it was pretty bad . when the opera singer came on , many people got up and walked out . this made me laugh , because i realized that o'donoghue was just pressing people 's buttons on purpose with this movie . or else he was just insane . whatever - you do n't need to waste your time watching it , it 's that bad .
i rented this back in the 80 's and honestly ca n't remember anything specific about the movie - only that it is the worst movie i have ever seen . this is n't one of those `` it was so bad , it was funny '' . this is n't one of those `` it was so gory , it leaves you with a bad feeling '' movies . it was n't even one of those `` what the heck was that ? '' movies . i ca n't recall the performance of the actors , but it was poorly shot , the story was disjointed , and it had no definable style . when it was over , i was angry that i had wasted the time . i 've seen plenty of movies i did n't understand because of unfamiliar cultures , styles and/or story-telling , but it was clear that those movies had some of those properties . the incubus has none . i actually contemplated not making a comment on this `` piece '' for fear that someone may watch it out of curiosity , but i am compelled to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie .
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . however , the little slave girl , alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining . alice 's smoking , drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting . i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation , and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie .
sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones . well , that 's my opinion anyway . this one will always be in the bad movie category , simply because all but shu qi 's performance was terrible . martial angel tells of cat ( shu qi ) , a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover , chi lam ( julian cheung ) , two years before . but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for . in order to rescue him , she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days , six other feisty women , to save the day ... i may have told the synopsis cheesily , but this is a cheesy story . in fact , the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all . much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice-paper in water . if i could sum it up , take a bad jackie chan movie , remove the comedy , remove the choreography , throw away the budget , and you have martial angels : a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all . mind you , i do have to give credit where credit 's due , and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action , as it was her performance that shone through . okay , you ca n't say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role . other than that , only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very brief . elsewhere , the film just fell to pieces . scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable , special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen , poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes , camera angles that were elementary and unflattering , and direction i 've seen better from a lost dog . i guess this film was a too many cooks affair . most probably , the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen . that did n't leave much else . frankly , the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn . charlie 's angels , it ai n't . in fact , while sisters can do it for themselves , none of that was really that apparent here . definitely one to forget .
maybe it 's the dubbing , or maybe it 's the endless scenes of people crying , moaning or otherwise carrying on , but i found europa '51 to be one of the most overwrought ( and therefore annoying ) films i 've ever seen . the film starts out promisingly if familiarly , as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son ( sandro franchina ) . whilst mummy and daddy ( bland alexander knox ) entertain their guests at a dinner party , the youngster tries to kill himself , setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy . spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ( ettore giannini ) , she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband , who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles . bergman plays the saint role to the hilt , echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc , and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect . unfortunately , the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety , as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes . by the final tear soaked scene , i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters . a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950 's flowers of st. francis .
`` phantasm '' of 1979 was a highly atmospheric , creepy , scary and very original horror flick , and , in one word , cult . the first sequel of 1988 was gory , witty , action-packed and highly entertaining . after the first sequel however , `` phantasm '' creator don coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas . `` phantasm iii - lord of the dead '' of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure , it even is quite entertaining , but there is no more originality , and the desperate attempts to bring in something new , are at times tiresome , which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors . - spoilers - quite in the beginning , we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres ( the brain-sucking flying silver balls ) is unraveled . thenceforward , a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters ( such as tim , a `` home alone '' -style little kid who happens to be great at shooting , an rocky , a tough and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew cut ) are introduced . the film also has its qualities - reggie bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed , guitar playing reggie . angus scrimm is still quite creepy as the tall man , but the fact that the tall man talks a lot more in this film , makes him loose some of his creepiness . the character of mike is played by a. michael baldwin again ( he had been replaced by james legros in part 2 ) , which , in my opinion , does n't make much of a difference . the gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch , but it is still a disappointment , especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly . all things considered , `` phantasm iii '' is an acceptable time-waster , but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors . fans of the first two `` phantasm '' films can give it a try , but i recommend not to set your expectations too high .
i actually liked this movie until the end . sure , it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon . until the end , that is . for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students , what does the main character do ? wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition ? no . she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears-wannabe pop song . my ears bled ! and , in the supreme moment of horror , her teachers gave her a standing ovation ! any teacher not in a spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot . save your time , save your ears - skip this movie !
this is easily the most disappointing , least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre , which , by the way , are films we generally enjoy a great deal in our home . rather than being `` exploitation '' or demeaning , these films actually provide a priceless insight into an era . well , not bucktown . in this story , duke returns to bucktown to operate the night club left to him by his recently deceased brother . he quickly learns that the city is entirely controlled by a corrupt police force , bleeding protection money out of all the local businesses . duke resists , and determines that he will rescue the city from the corrupt police . unfortunately , he does so by calling in a posse of his friends ( these people are vaguely explained as some former black-militants who have worked with duke on `` jobs '' in the past ) and they simply murder the entire police department in cold blood . and literally in the presence of hundreds of witnesses who do nothing to stop it . ignorance is not a justification for murder , and it would have been much more entertaining to see the cracker police suffer for their actions as opposed to merely getting whacked in the street . while revenge is a ubiquitous and generally satisfying theme in films of this genre , it is a far cry from seeing pam grier track down the thugs who off'ed her family , cuss them out , give them a jujitsu ass-kickin ' and set their 'fro on fire . that has art ( and a reason for existing ) and merits a level of respect that is quite undeserved by simply shooting someone in the back . of course , in this bizarre tale , she is playing a woman completely under the man 's thumb , afraid of the crackers who run her town and oppress her people . indeed , her advice to duke is , `` run , man , they gon na kill you ! '' following the sickening and gratuitous violence , we are expected to believe that the town 's mayor wholeheartedly condones the actions of duke and his friends , congratulating them and offering to throw a parade in their honor , as opposed to , say , calling the district attorney to press capital murder charges against them and have them taken into custody . duke 's posse declines the parade and instead opts to fill the numerous vacancies on the police force created by their recent killing spree . they immediately prove to be even more corrupt than their cracker police predecessors ( to quote the mayor , `` they are ten times worse than what we had before ! '' ) . now duke finds he must again rescue the citizens of bucktown from corrupt , protection-racket law enforcement officials and again make it safe for decent folk to operate a prostitution business in the streets . unfortunately , duke has already lost all moral high ground and sympathy due a hero , as he was a willing participant in the murder of the original police force . i would n't have cared one way or the other if he had rescued bucktown or gotten plugged himself at this point . i suppose we are to be entertained by the clever way duke has to outsmart the new police goons , but in reality the film has now just become an opera of gratuitous violence , duke murders all of his former friends and allies in cold blood with the same absence of compassion he had when gunning down the cracker police . duke is a pig . finally , when everyone in town but duke , aretha , and the employees of the local brothel are dead and bleedin ' in the street , our hero and heroine walk off into the night as though they had some admirable qualities or redeeming values ; they do n't . duke is merely a murderous thug and aretha his enabling misogynist accomplice . if you are interested in this genre of film , by all means , i highly recommend them , see coffy , foxy brown , truck turner , blacula , sheba baby but if in the process you should run across this dvd , throw it as far away as you possibly can ! drop it like it 's hot ! it should be treated as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste ! there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era that is not dramatically more entertaining , satisfying and populated with more sympathetic and admirable characters than this piece of slime , obviously written by and targeted at some hormonally imbalanced high school sophomores .
this film is deeply disappointing . not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues , it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring . the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with j.b. lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories . wenders 's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world 's culture ( or actually , american culture ) traveling in space , but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid . yawn . i had expected more of him .
`` i just viewed this movie last night and i do n't think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved , because this movie will stick in the back of my mind . '' the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing . i mean every time i see tom cruise or demi moore in a movie , i think of `` a few good men '' which is a good thing . now , every time i see ron perlman or kristy swanson , i will think of `` tinseltown '' which is a very bad thing . i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with arye gross and the aforementioned swanson and perlman , i thought that it at least would n't be bad . you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of wheeling , indiana ( where ? exactly . ) , but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie . wrong . this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word . it is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes . the characters are paper-thin . you almost care about none of the characters , and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them . okay , the two real writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves , so they figure so does the audience . they do n't even think about character development , except for trying to tie there story back to `` gilligan 's island '' . the plot is unoriginal . two guys live in a storage center , where one of them stores a bed , and there are about twenty other people living there , too . the rest of the story is contrived and stupid . have you seen `` national lampoon 's favorite deadly sins '' ? the second story with joe mantegna is about a television writer who ca n't find a good story to make a tv movie about , so he creates one . now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter , morph mantegna into to annoying actors half his age , and take away the comedy and you have this movie . the actors try . kristy swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie . she is still hot , but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos . as for everyone else , i do n't think it was the actors fault because they have bad material go watch the national lampoon 's movie , but stay away from this movie .
this was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it 's low budget trappings . the use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably . they made good use of the small budget i guess . i just wish the story and most of the acting was better . there are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they do n't . confusing and unbelievable story . bad dvd transfer too . it does n't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting . this i had to shut off . it was too boring . i can do slow movies . but just make them appealing in some aspect . visually , story-wise , acting , etc . this was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience . maybe the film maker 's next attempt will be better .
what a powerful start to a film when julia roberts character is punched in the face by her abusive and anal husband played by patrick bergin and i felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as farrah fawcett 's the burning bed . well , as the summary says i was mis-lead . this film was nothing like the burning bed , which had power and farrah played the part of a woman you truly felt for , and felt her pain and her need to survive . sleeping with the enemy drifted off after the first act into cheap thrills with roberts faking her death to escape her husband and goes to live in iowa . her husband at first believes she is dead but starts to grow suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off after her . the rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with julia getting a house in this small town in iowa and changing her identity .... there is no mention of course how she got the money for this but at this point in the film i did not care all that much . she meets a guy ( mr. nice wimpy ) and falls for him and her husband does finally catch up to her but not before he re-arranges her soup cans and straightens up the kitchen . this was i assume to provide a cheap thrill to the audience . but i did not care much if she was an abused wife because the film as i have said cheated the audience . if it had stayed the course i might have felt for her and her situation . of course the husband is killed and all is well for little ol ms roberts . if only the real world was anything close to this .... see the burning bed and you understand what a film is suppose to be like on the subject of domestic abuse .
mulva is put in a sugercoma by teen ape . when she awakens she 's considerably hotter ( the parts played by debbie rochon in this sequel ) , and out for revenge on those that did her wrong . as the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the `` kill bill '' films , but this being a chris seaver 's film , it 's a wildly incompetent satire ( and i use that last term extremely loosely ) i 'd love to say this is better than the first film , but truth be told i was so impossibly drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i ca n't even hope to compare the two at this point in time . but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel ( see when i 'm drunk i like , for lack of a better word , complete and total crappy movies ) there are a few laugh out loud moments ( very few ) but i do remember bonejack being funnier though . well at least at slightly over an hour , it is over mighty quickly for what it 's worth . my grade : d+ dvd extras : audio commentary by director chris seaver , actress debbie rochon , and the lbp gang ; second commentary by seaver ; 31 minute making of featurette ; lloyd kaufman 's 6 minute tribute to low budget pictures ; fake 2 minute syrup commercial ; stills gallery ; promo trailer ; and trailers for : mulva '' , 'quest for the egg salad '' , `` fiilthy mcnasty '' 1 , 2 , & 3 ; `` the feral man '' , `` the bonesetter '' , `` midnight skater '' , `` demon summer '' & `` splatter rampage wrestling ''
i was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list , but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed . the main problem of this movie is that actors are n't capable of holding this movie on their back . why ? because of bad script . although dillon , lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level , there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary . so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie , just like for admirers of beautiful diane lane . legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him ; far below his level . so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but do n't expect anything big or extraordinary . the only thing that you 'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes ; rest of it is very forgettable .
not the best of actors ' movies.the director has concentrated on projected actor 's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer . may be hero himself , his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it.but definitely it 's not worth for neutral audience.the fight sequences are a total comedy.the dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic . the music is average.this film was the biggest flop for the actor . inspite of the hype created over the movie , the movie failed miserably . do n't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time . you can watch some cartoon instead.a good movie buff can not digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours .
look , i loved the proper anchorman film , but this was reaaaaallly bad . the kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life , the kind of bad that makes you think `` what on earth were they thinking to film this in the first place '' , the kind of bad that makes you wish you 'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film , the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun , the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a pauly shore film instead .... seriously , i can not explain how very bad this was . having said that .... there were some semi-amusing laughs , but they are all so much less funny than anchorman . sure , they tried to make it entertaining and fun , but the entire subplot that was left out of anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason ... it was n't even a little bit good . do yourself a favour ( or in the usa , a favor ) , and do n't watch this dvd ... it will tarnish the good movie that anchorman is and you do n't want to do that . okay ... i 'm alright now .
i 've seen the movie only recently , although it appeared in 2001 . i hoped to see an entertaining movie , but let me tell you , princess blade is nothing compared to azumi . the `` princess '' is not very talkative , as you may have noticed ... she reminded me of jean claude van damme , who only stared to make his point , then beat the crap out of the opponents . during the entire movie , i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked , why was she fighting , who did she love and trust . i waited in vain . crappy movie . crappy dialog . do n't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds ! it 's so bad , that in the end i was wondering how i managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour . approximately . i give a 4/10 .
this movie is complete crap ! avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs , it is rambling and incoherent . i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70 's sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty . i like being shocked , but i need a coherent story . however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you . the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang . i mean its just plain hard to sit through , not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly . please , i know the cover is interesting ( what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman 's bare ass ) but do n't waste your time or money as you wo n't get either back .
i really hate this show ! i had watched one episode , and i knew this show is really terrible . the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad ... i mean it is just a sh++ty rip-off of dexter 's laboratory and johnny quest , 'bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog ; a stay-at-home dad and a smart , super-busy mom ... like oh-my-flippin'-god ! their dad is a mother-f * * kin ' crazy home-maker , is n't that so gay ! if my dad is a home-maker , i would personally die ! of shame that is ... really i would . i have nothing else to about this ... this travesty but only 3 word ; count them 3 words to describe it : · lame , · stupid , and above all ... · f * * k up ! that 's all i could say folks , it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev-er ! if i had one that is .
the marquis de sade , egypt , ancient gnostic cults , robert englund in a dual role , gratuitous sex and nudity , murder and mayhem ... on paper tobe hopper 's night terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun , entertaining flick given the ingredients . it 's not . it is a plot less , incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment . there is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of de sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local christian archaeologist and kill her . that is pretty much it- i think it has something to with the gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking . most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness , dream sequences and erotic encounters , intercut with scenes of englund as the imprisoned de sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery . it seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness , bad acting , sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads . there are n't too many good points . robert englund is fun to watch , as always and the lead actress , zoe trilling , whilst not very talented , is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching night terrors is a chore . at least i got to see the movie from which the `` when you 're as criminal as i '' bit from the australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many vhs tapes from the nineties came from .
i suppose that any novel that 's as much of a downer as moby dick would not find much favor with depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles . but any resemblance to the classic herman melville novel is a pure coincidence . in fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it , not that too much of it was kept for the film . we first meet ahab creely ( he 's got a last name and a brother ) as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry joan bennett who is father mapple 's daughter . that brother derek , played by lloyd hughes , also wants to marry bennett . john barrymore is ahab in an over the top performance . barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in . we see ahab lose his leg to the great whale moby dick and i have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome . of course this was all before the code . still i 'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered . after that the story of ahab 's hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in joan bennett 's eyes . that is not exactly melville 's motivation , in fact there are no women characters in moby dick as he wrote it . one of the things melville did was invest the crew of ahab 's ship the pequod with personalities . other than queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there , but not the personalities . starbuck and stubbs might as well be smith and jones . i 'd see this version of moby dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else .
i do n't know where to begin . the cast is full of people who 've never done anything before or since . debralee scott is listed on cover boxes , but does not appear in the movie at all . the writing is quite bad , even for college films . it 's obviously very low budget , with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing . the characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy , nerd , suave black guy , tough guys , guy with mustache , attractive girl , small town girl , etc . the featured teacher is about what 's you 'd expect ... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily . if you wa n't to see a college flick , stay clear from this one . it 's so bad , it 's not even funny .
manoj agrawal after the failure of pardesi babu ( 1998 ) returned with this film the film has govinda in 8-9 roles , as his father , mother , grandfather , sister and later-on he also has disguises he in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife , whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with rani he disguises as a sardarji in the plane and again as a girl the funny part is how easily and in short time he does that ? then he disguises as a french singer and enters a tv to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian ( yes inside the tv itself ) the rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note there are some funny scenes like govinda being bashed by an african and also many other portions direction by manoj agrawal is okay music is okay amongst actors govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors he as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6-7 roles do n't actually fit in the film rani looks fat , teams up well with govinda thatz it she is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles amongst rest nirmal pandey is as usual johny lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older tinnu anand is okay satish kaushik is hilarious , paresh is okay tanaaz is okay
there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning . first of all we all know what this year 's oscar 's were really all about this year . it was the academy 's way of showing people that they are no racist , and never have been . they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves . secondly , it 's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show , because really , what difference will it make ? but , it 's fun to write about it . this is the year i became fed-up with the oscar 's ! i will never watch the show again . every year they do something wrong . before crowe wins for `` gladaitor '' when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for `` sunshine '' . if you have n't seen this movie yet , watch it and you 'll agree . `` eyes wide shut '' when released receieved no nominations . and as far as this year goes , well , the bad choices were all over the place ! baz lurhmann gets no `` best director '' nomination ! are you joking ! ! `` a beautiful mind '' is up for `` best make-up '' ? ? ? ? `` training day '' gets nominated ? ? the movie was awful , and it seemed like washington did n't even turn in a performance , all he proved was , he knows how to use four letter words ! that 's what h won the award for ! take away the language and i bet he was almost playing himself ! i liked `` gosford park '' , i really did , but why 7 nominations ? and how on earth could they not give it too altman ! i mean , c'mon , if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings , what about altman ? the man has been in the public 's eye for 32 years now and no oscar ! there were many , many things that bothered me about this year 's oscar 's , but , i 'll live with it , as long as i never have to watch another show again ! the highpoint ( and the only one ) of the show was when woody allen made his first appearance ever to the award show . that will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show .
i wondered why i did n't like peggy sue got married more than i did , when it first came out in 1986 , with all the hype . somehow i found nic cage 's character off-putting . way off-putting . then the plot did n't seem to make sense . then by the end of the credits , the question came to mind : what point was this movie making ? what was it saying ? the answer , unfortunately , was not much , if anything . i really do n't think this movie aimed at making a statement ; unless it was `` your life is your life , you 're gon na make the same mistakes no matter what , so keep your eye upon the doughnut , and not the hole '' . not a very profound statement , and i 'm sorry , not profoundly made in this movie . the writing simply is n't that good . the direction is uneven , and is strangely overblown at times . kathleen turner was the best , and in my opinion , only worthwhile thing in this movie , and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre , unexplained circumstances , with a script that had no apparent statement to make . she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i did n't enjoy this movie more . she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola 's direction every step of the way , doing it `` his own way '' ( not a good idea for a new actor ) , and putting on a goofy voice she called `` stupid '' . his voice was annoying , abrasive and unnatural , and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy . i understand what he was attempting to do : play a young-guy `` hot shot '' who is not as hot as he thinks he is , setting up his own karma for future failure . but he goes overboard , the way he does it is abrasive , not effective , and if he had listened to his uncle instead of `` fighting the man '' , we would have had a more enjoyable film . cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person , and those scenes are more watchable than others . but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety , i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l.a. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected ( put-on ) scenes . the movie does n't aim for a statement , does n't make a point , is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression ( but without the voice ) , and is , ultimately , confusing and a waste of time . given all this , kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie . i ca n't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this , unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes . believe me , you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes , and it will make just as much sense . kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments , which proves that she 's strong enough to be honest , and to hell with other people 's comments . you go , turner ! i 'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first-rate actor or actress , but her candor is refreshing . cage 's acting can be good to annoying , and here it does n't work . at least , in this film , now we know why .
doris day never lets a bad script get her down . even in the most trying of circumstances , day gives 100 % and usually comes out unscathed . this comedy , perhaps inspired by a real-life new york city black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s french play by claude magnier , gives doris little to do but spoof her own goody-goody image and , in the second-half , be comically sedated ( which is amusing because of the spin day gives to the situation ) . there are some funny lines here , yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play ... and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the big apple , we get stuck in the suburbs . doris ' co-stars ( patrick o'neal , robert morse , and terry-thomas ) are not well-suited to her , and neither is the shapeless hairdo they 've got her wearing . still , it 's not terrible , it features a few big laughs , and for day-buffs it 's a must-see . * * from * * * *
about 15 minutes in , my wife was already wanting to leave . not so much because of the material , but the lack thereof . they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should 've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could . when this would let up ( very rare ) , we 'd sit back and watch ( not laughing , mind you ) and wait for the next gross-out or offensive remark ( s ) . after about 35 minutes , we both got up and left . everything we 'd read said how great this was . the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it `` intelligent '' and said it was n't a crude sex comedy . did he go to the right movie ? along with be cool , it 's the only other movie i 've ever walked out on ... and i have no regrets . i 'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america .
originally called the changer . the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski ( carl zschering ) who `` likes em young '' . unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant . this `` chant '' involves whistling 'london bridge is falling down ' whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer . nonetheless , ugly joe tries it out and hey presto ! he is now a girl . ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls . but lets not talk about ideals here - this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 , in an ideal world it should have never been released . the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as `` mind numbing , ham handed story telling '' . its worse than that . the nostril picker really takes the biscuit , in fact the whole god-damn cookie jar . terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead actors , a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist . just when things could n't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent . for instance , joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself . but i thought he wanted to get close to them ? not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims , of which there were only around 3-4 . the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker ( steven andrews ) then taking `` her '' back to his apartment . what happens next defies belief ... joe turns back into a man , but also discovers the hooker is a man . how does he react ? well , in a benny hill-esquire fashion , he chases `` her '' around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo 's only to trip up on a blow up doll . god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of . at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment . this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2-bit joke shop 'cop ' uniform . the hilarious acting is a must see . especially the hooker 's inability at saying `` dildo '' and his demand for `` satisfaction '' . apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore . you know a movie 's bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting . normally , i 'd fast forward to the good bits , only there were n't any here . the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly . forget quick cuts , matthews utilizes fadeouts ( one during a stab scene ) to limit any form of suspense there might already be . one girl 's non-reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable . normally i 'd relish the words `` uncut '' but in this case they were far from a blessing . just more agonizing cinematic torture . the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders , only less entertaining . i 'd hate to see the cut version . to sum up , the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i 've seen since richard hammond 's 5 o ' clock show . dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing . do n't be fooled by the box label , this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets-use-shitty-horror-dvds-for-coffee-coasters cult . which i think it does . unless re-edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess .
spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ... . . . . . . . as a rabid robin williams fan , i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on-screen appearance . wow ... i could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie . essentially , the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them . robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit . i 'm all for bawdy humor , but this humor was n't pleasantly vulgar , or ribald ... it was just mind-numbing . there are no redeeming qualities to this film , other than robin williams fanatics , like me , who simply have to own every piece of film .
i was enjoying this movie most of the time , but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children 's movie . i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then , while filming , decided to add in some blood , nudity and language . it was a big let down . there 's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like `` babe '' ( the pig ) or `` angels in the outfield '' that defeats the evil tooth fairy . the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy . when i bought this movie , i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls ; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money , but they do n't . they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls .
i liked the first movie , but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better of left on the drawing board . the general idea in the first movie was , if not great , then at least very interesting . this sequel tries to build upon the idea and the characters from the first movie , and though christopher walken is still good as gabriel , the whole idea suddenly gets a bit ridiculous . if you have n't seen any of these movies , then get the first movie and forget about the sequels , they can take away all of the joy from the original .
why is this film so bad ? well , if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason , then this film is it . the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst . the gags are predictable but that is n't what makes it bad . they are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say . corky romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy . his quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the fbi to destroy any trace of the family 's crime history . however , it is n't that easy for corky because the fbi believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family . mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does n't feel like any comic hijixn are there . corky ends up in love with his beautiful fbi partner and has to set the record straight with both the fbi and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again . i think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes . chris kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film . it is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb , slap stick humor . will ferrel , kattan 's snl partner , seems to have made a full career out of it . the only difference between kattan and ferrel is that ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke . there is absolutely no diversity in kattan 's routine . it 's hard to hear the same joke twice , but for a whole movie that is just pure torture . the other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and funny jokes . the gay mafia brother , the awkward guy sch-tick , and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it . it seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it . even with a cast that has some comedic talent ( chris penn , peter falk ) the jokes that commence are tired . there is no chemistry too . this film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors . no body seemed to care about it , or even try . sad thing is , no body told chris kattan that .
yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue `` thriller , '' this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall , who , without humphrey bogart 's tender attentions to humanize her , comes off as her usual shrill , shallow self . even master gigolo charles boyer can not feign romantic interest in her .
this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong . i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie was n't half as good . the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny , the spoofs of the smoking ban , jo bole ... etc . are genuinely good jokes but i do n't know whom to blame this movie flop on . the prime candidates may be : - 1 ) the hammers ( actors ) and hammeresses ( actresses ) and not even the funny kind 2 ) the director 3 ) the guy who cast the actors and/or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie , or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film . p.s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
as a long-time fan of superman from the comics , through the 1950s series , the first two of the chris reeves films and lois & clark , and finally smallville , i was * really * hoping for something clever with `` superman returns '' . instead we got lex luthor making * another * attempt at real-estate conversion , another superman-beaten-up-while-wearing-kryptonite sequence , and internal inconsistencies : he could n't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 '' of kryptonite , but when lois breaks off 3 '' of it , * leaving the rest embedded in him * , he can lift * a continent * into space ? ? really , the only hero in the story was lois ' partner - i ca n't remember his name off-hand . he did all kinds of life-saving , heroic things with nothing but guts and skill - no superpowers , no invulnerability ... just a normal human . they keep making superman so small . why ca n't we have superman battling brainiac or fighting to save the universe from general zod instead of lex 's petty schemes . oh , i forgot ... they 're doing that in smallville . yeah ... i think i 'll stick to smallville ... you probably should , too ...
i saw this film at the rotterdam festival , as did presumably all the other voters . the director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very committed to the project , which i think explains the above average reception and mark it got . it 's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite `` round the twist '' but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature . the movie in itself is maybe worth seeing if you 're trying to do a cinematic world tour visiting all un member states , as i ca n't think of another fijian movie but overall it was generic , poorly acted ( albeit by an amateur cast ) and prey to the subaltern mentality . the moral of the story seemed to be that native islanders will try and screw each other over , but as long as there is an essentially decent white governor to step in , all problems can be solved ( by leaving the island ) .
someone mentioned editing . this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess . for starters , let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments . why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in ? and , what exactly are they testing ? apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit . the acting is pretty bad . everyone is emoting . everyone is keeping secrets . they frequently mention that if it were n't for the money , they 'd hang it up . there 's a deranged minister who spouts scripture . on and on . but , again , the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors . there are some really cheesy elements . those little rooms and those chaise lounges . the awful wallpaper ( was it wallpaper ? ) . it was interesting , but did n't seem to go anywhere .
redundant , but again the case . if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics ( in this case , schneider ) , then you should go . basic comedy .man 's life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him . unfortunately , he takes on each animal 's characteristics . former survivor colleen looks pretty good here , now that she does n't have open sores on her legs , and a little makeup on her face ! d
today i found `` they all laughed '' on vhs on sale in a rental . it was a really old and very used vhs , i had no information about this movie , but i liked the references listed on its cover : the names of peter bogdanovich , audrey hepburn , john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me , the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it . i searched imdb , and the user rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference . i looked in `` mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003 '' and  wow  four stars ! so , i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it . indeed , i have just finished watching `` they all laughed '' and i found it a very boring overrated movie . the characters are badly developed , and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story . the plot is supposed to be funny ( private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing ) , but i have not laughed along the whole story . the coincidences , in a huge city like new york , are ridiculous . ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man , with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt , antonio banderas or george clooney , is quite ridiculous . in the end , the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten , murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie , and whose life was showed in `` star 80 '' and `` death of a centerfold : the dorothy stratten story '' ; the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen , the future mrs. keith richards ; the always wonderful , even being fifty-two years old , audrey hepburn ; and the song `` amigo '' , from roberto carlos . although i do not like him , roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 's and is called by his fans as `` the king '' . i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions ( manly dorothy stratten ) . my vote is four . title ( brazil ) : `` muito riso e muita alegria '' ( `` many laughs and lots of happiness '' )
we loved school of rock and jack black . we could n't wait to go and see this movie . it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out . my husband hated it too . the only funny parts were in the trailers . my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money . the writing was awful . it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended . the movie was n't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity . the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry . i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts , but there were n't . save you money and your time .
the movie had a lot of potential , unfortunately , it came apart because of a weak/implausible story line , miscasting , and general lack of content/substance . one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery , who played an arab man , did n't know how to pronounce his own arab name ! this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details . the quality of acting was uniformly well below average . movie 's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end ; and a french song ( i do n't recall the title ) . overall , it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast .
i watched this a few days ago , so details are getting hazy . the film is shot on hand-held cameras , and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally , since we had n't had many studio pictures made in this way . i ca n't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything , designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen has n't had all the compromises that come with a big budget , and so was more `` real '' . however what we have here is n't much more than a not-as-good rip off of the first half of full metal jacket , so anyone who has seen that , or any one of the other rip offs there of , will know what to expect . the main problem i had was the stereotyped characters , with the weedy soft kids out of their depth , close harmony singing , ebonics spouting black dudes , world weary sergeants , bitter and twisted psychos etc etc ... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time . maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation , maybe it was laziness , or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience , all i know is it was annoying . one novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees ( where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation , ) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it . this seems to be the main pivot of the plot , with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth , but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way . the other big bug i had was how all the characters ( with the exception of the psychos and the real softies ) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence , faced with farrell 's ubiquitous stoicism , immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic . i guess if i had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads , which was strong and very convincing , tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters , this was n't too hard . in my imagination , bozz grew up to be zeke off tour of duty , and for my money , 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch .
in reviewing this film i can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in july , august , and september of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth , fort polk , louisiana . take the high ground was not anything like i remember basic training . but one has to remember at the time this was post korea which ended in a stalemate , but it was a conventional war as we knew them . it was not vietnam , a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit . the draft at that time was an unwelcome , but accepted as still necessary for the country 's defense . richard widmark is a veteran of korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas . the film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train . they 're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade . one thing i will praise take the high ground for is the fact that mgm recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of william hazard as a black recruit in the platoon . it was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing . but i will say that a recruit like russ tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one . richard widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give jerome courtland confidence with a weapon . and no way would have he worried so much about robert arthur deserting . he 's have just let the mps deal with him . of course being shot in and around fort bliss and el paso , texas did give take the high ground good authenticity . but view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day . i do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were n't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95 % of the time . but there ai n't no way that karl malden would have slugged widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits . both would have realized that would have undermined authority , something the military just does n't let happen . i wish i could have said something better about take the high ground because i certainly like its talented cast , it 's talented director richard brooks , even the silly theme by dimitri tiomkin and ned washington , fresh from their oscar a year before for high noon . the film actually got an oscar nomination for best screenplay and story by millard kaufman . it must have been for kaufman 's vivid imagination .
watching `` der himmel über berlin '' as a teen in the late 80 's was a profound experience for me - `` so this was what the movies could be '' . along with `` paris , texas '' and `` until the end of the world '' it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of wim wenders . unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with `` million dollar hotel '' and `` land of plenty '' hitting a terrible low point . gone are the captivating pictures or music . no search for or display of great insight . all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements , that boils down to nothing but clichés , and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience . has the well run dry ? whatever the reason , it 's time for mr. wenders to either step it up or stop altogether .
one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through , killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show , brain damage , and pulp fiction . designed primarily to offend , apparently , but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it .
i 'm actually watching this film as i write this . . . if the following comments `` prove my lack of development as a true , artistic film maker '' , then so be it . . . but . . . i thought ( am still thinking as i 'm presently viewing ) that this film . . . to put it mildly , is very , very overrated . again , very . it looks like a really , really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who did n't pay that much attention to detail . i do n't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking , but . . . well . . . i just do n't get it ( rememeber , i fully admit that maybe it 's me that 's the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this `` piece of imaginative genius '' ) . . . i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very , very outstanding . . . sheesh . . .
it must be assumed that those who praised this film ( `` the greatest filmed opera ever , '' did n't i read somewhere ? ) either do n't care for opera , do n't care for wagner , or do n't care about anything except their desire to appear cultured . either as a representation of wagner 's swan-song , or as a movie , this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster , with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy , lugubrious realisation of the text . it 's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera ( or , for that matter , a play , especially one by shakespeare ) is `` about '' should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio ; syberberg , very fashionably , but without the smallest justification from wagner 's text , decided that parsifal is `` about '' bisexual integration , so that the title character , in the latter stages , transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe , though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers , and we get a double dose of armin jordan , the conductor , who is seen as the face ( but not heard as the voice ) of amfortas , and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music -- in which , by the way , the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf , an expedient which baffles me . in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts , but i ca n't think why syberberg could n't splice in , for parsifal and gurnemanz , mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music ... the sound is hard to endure , the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual . someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording , and knappertsbusch , though his tempi are often very slow , had what jordan altogether lacks , a sense of pulse , a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and , after half a century , the orchestral sound in that set , in modern pressings , is still superior to this film .
the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest ; the intriguing plot ( such as it is ) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along ! a would-be female vampire ( scantily-clad , as promised by the title ) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast ' on the blood of willing victims ( who are apparently members of a suicide club ) as if unsure where all of this would lead him , the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero 's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant ( ? ! ) from the future ! the languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere ( the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl ) are , of course , typical of both the film-maker ( ditto the seashore setting at the { anti } climax ) and the `` euro-cult '' style , as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display . personally , the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson ( who appeared in six latter-day luis bunuel films ) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time !
when i saw the preview , i thought : this is going to be a great movie . and indeed it could have been . the actress playing the main character was very credible , and the beauty of the filming is undeniable . however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture . the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 , and it took away most of the magic of the film . however , i must congratulate the translator , because the english sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues , and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd !
* * spoilers * * i rented `` tesis '' ( or `` thesis '' in english ) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar 's later effort `` the others '' . based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was , i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror . instead i wound up with the most tedious , preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i 've seen since the german film `` anatomie '' ( which this one kinda reminded me of ) . the plot has potential but it 's thrown away within the first 20 minutes . it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela 's ( ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer ) thesis on the subject of violence in films . through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here , she winds up in possession of a 'snuff ' tape on which two men torture , mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera . angela , and her horror-buff friend chema ( fele martinez ) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who 's responsible for it . this leads to ... well , nothing . they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl 's killers ( since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events , even when their own lives at risk ) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls . there is only one proper 'clue ' ( the type of camera the killers used is discovered ) and that 's a ) a really weak one and b ) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes . the rest of the so-called 'unravelling ' just occurs through blind luck , increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful , transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time . seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he 's clearly never read a detective book in his life . the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence , before moving in for the final twist . in `` tesis '' , * potential spoiler ahead * the killer 's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives ' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas , throws his hands up and says `` ok , ya got me , it was him after all '' ! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck . you 're watching the wrong movie if that 's what you 're after . the only thing that drags `` tesis '' down further from just being a dumb , badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous , muddled-up 'point ' about violence in films . i have no idea what stance it 's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided , confused psychobabble , in between the rest of the gibberish , and say `` look at me ! i 'm political ! '' . the final scenes , in which the `` point '' of the movie is supposedly hammered home , are so utterly absurd and puerile , one ca n't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this . if he does n't , he certainly should . this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house ' stuff . overall i ca n't believe i wasted two whole hours ( it felt like at least six ) on this , just hoping something might happen . the urban legend of 'snuff films ' ( and that is basically all they are , despite the way this film tries to suggest they 're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world ! ) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ( `` videodrome '' anyone ? ) but it 's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'would n't it be cool if ! ' territory with it ( ie : `` my little eye '' ) ... `` tesis '' hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie ' genre . on every level , this one is better left dead and buried . i 'll award it a 1 out of 10 , for some nice lighting , but that 's all it 's getting .
i love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes were n't all grey ? margaret rutherford dominates this movie . her `` eccentric '' garb is actually rather attractive and yes , she has an amazing hourglass figure . but i feel she was given her head rather too much . she probably developed this characterisation over many performances , and nobody told her `` if it gets a laugh , leave it out . '' she does too much deranged fooling about when she 's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth . the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery . arcati behaves like a retired headmistress ( we 'll really put our backs into it ! ) . the contrast between her breezy , commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs is n't really brought out . just because all the actors are english ( apart from cummings ) , the americans feel they have to use the words `` brit '' , `` stiff '' , `` lip '' and `` upper '' . oh , give it a rest ! the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks ( did he make love to you ? yes , but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry ! ) .
oh my . i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends , wanting to watch one of those mild , feel-good christmas movies , and i walk out disgusted . the movie failed . full-stop . paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly , along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine . they try and turn a christmas movie , into some new-style . sort of bad , mixed with good , but it all turned out very wrong . the first ten or so minutes were n't too bad , but once we saw santa , it was over . it did n't get any better , the rate stayed the same , there was no character development , and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented . do n't watch it , whatever you do .
this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew . based on shielah graham 's autobiography , it seems like the powers that be could n't leave well enough alone . they could n't decide if this was to be graham 's story or fitzgerald 's story , and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever 's story it turned out to be . so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating ( fitzgerald ) and notorious ( ms. graham ) personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either . added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 . clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing . however - and this saved the film for me - kerr has never looked lovelier , and peck is as always a very handsome man . they truly make a beautiful , mature couple , and i only wish they had better material to work with . there is one scene that does work - scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state , and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs . other than that , the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950 ( peyton place , the best of everything ) .
wow ! only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar `` showgirls . '' i mean where to begin ? the indescibably horrid theme song ? pia zadora 's non-expressions throughout the movie ? the fact that despite being set in los angeles , aka `` land of the casting couch '' every single man ( and woman ! ) is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora , by any contrived means necessary ? or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they 're either mind-numbingly stupid ( pia ) or obvious despicable sleazeball ( everyone else ) ? and given that this flick was written by actual `` screenwriters ( sorta ) , it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie-making industry ( who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter ? ) but it 's ( unintentionally ) funny as hell though . the `` breakdown '' scene alone will have you giggling , and after seeing the climatic `` i 'm not the only one who had to * * * * her way to the top '' scene at the `` awards '' ( all done in the usual bargain-basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia ) , i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she `` won '' her golden globe . it 's fitting and that would totally make my day . anyway , if you 're a fan of bad , tashy camp , give this otherwise tacky movie a try .
in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience . fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie . larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer . the plot is thin to say the least , the cantonese dialog is not funny . see this movie at your peril . david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate . the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there , and just blends into the scenery . it was like watching paint dry . in short this movie was a total waste of time and space . i 've seen better movies on youtube .
john boorman 's 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback , though it 's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself . one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill ( alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles ) , it has an abundance of incident and style ( the film was shot in colour but released in b & w scope in some territories ) but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever . with a main character who threatens witnesses , car bombs doctors , causes a hundred people to lose their jobs , tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister , it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film . it does n't get it . instead , it 's lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson 's worst and most disinterested performance : he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there 's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character . on the plus side , this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug , but it 's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics . there 's a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the 'general ' and his men , painting them as 'anti-social ' drug dealers purely because cahill wo n't share his loot from a robbery with them , but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we 're expected to find lovably cheeky - that it 's just thrown away . things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart , but by then it 's too late to really care . adrian dunbar , maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles , but jon voight 's hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance , overcompensating for gleeson 's comatose non-involvement in what feels like a total misfire . come back zardoz , all is forgiven .
things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee . bleek gilliam ( denzell washington ) is a happenin ' jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at below the underdog . his problems include an incompetent manager , a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he 's playing musical mattress with . the real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music . the band 's manager , giant , has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but bleek remains loyal for as long as possible . it will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man . as bleek , denzell washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm . he 's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art , dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness . he simply lacks the fire . wesley snipes who plays henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of lee 's torpid dialogue . as giant , lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction . loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic ratso rizzo to bleek 's joe buck he adopts a limp and even the `` i 'm walkin ' here '' moment from midnight cowboy . in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it . lee 's script is all tepid argument , heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that lee has to inject to remain down . the scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the bleek , giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles . completing this travesty is lee 's pretentious visual style . tracking shots , zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes . they just wander . blues is lee 's love letter to jazz ( made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets ) and it 's all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve . jazz on film is better served by tavernier 's `` round midnight '' and eastwood 's `` bird '' which get below the surface , reveal more sides of the form , the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest whitaker and the real deal dexter gordon . this spike lee joint does n't even offer a mild buzz . it 's some pretty bad homegrown .
this is really a very bad movie . why ? first of all , the story is bad . it is an artificial story , combining all sorts of things together that make no sense . it just seems a wrong experiment . secondly , the actors can not play in a realistic manner . they can not even talk as an actor should . why did i buy this movie ? and what must i do with it now ?
a friend of mine gave me this movie . a friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a dvd casing from his * * * . i got quit excited by the prospects of an other michael chabon movie . after all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great , but boy , was i wrong . first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so . i imagine the castings went something like this . `` tell me , do you like fish ? '' `` yes i enjoy fish very much . '' `` wonder full , you 're hired . have some money . '' than there is the script . i have read chabon , who i hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong , and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel . i 'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did , but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out . this is an actual line from the movie ; `` if you tell me something that you 've never said out loud to anyone before , than this moment becomes unique ! '' unique ? does it ? does it really ? off course not you plank . please pass me the imodium . i 'll have a whole * * * * ing strip . the directing is ... well . i 've got nothing . maybe rawson marshall thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something . stick to directing comedies . no stick to directing commercials . this movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age . i give it 2 stars because i do n't wan na be the guy that watched a 1 star movie .
this movie was kind of interesting ... i had to watch it for a college class about india , however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it does n't really contain much cold , hard information on those details . it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together . the gore factor is superb , however . even right at the very beginning , you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense . only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore , because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it . i 've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events , however you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch .
if utterly facile , regressive , self-indulgent , anti-establishment , anti-civilisation juvenilia appeals to you , then this is the ideal film . very poorly scripted , with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout , this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic , manichean terms : all adults ( especially teachers , parents , priests and doctors ) are insensitive and bumbling at best , and predatory monsters at worst . the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming ( yawn ) and infantile regression ( literally ) in a primitive cave-like space in the woods , with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again , in the woods ( naturally ... ) . displays all the weaknesses of a first film , and plenty more besides .
this is not a horror film , but a boring sex movie . a very bad movie , to be avoided by any serious horror fan . no plot , awful acting and annoying music . if you only watch the trailer you will know enough ... it 's a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable . if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead . those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash . rating = even `` 1 '' is too much ! and believe me , i am not the only one with this opinion .
every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener ca n't stand or never watched all the way through . this is the movie that i think of ... days later . it 's got something to do with a play by shakespeare . not sure , but i think i bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it ... think i realised that my toenails would n't clip themselves , and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut . this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me . even though this is the first movie i 've given such a low score to ( which i 've actually attempted to watch ) , i would n't want to put you off other movies by it 's english director , peter greenaway . i remember thinking that his `` the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover '' was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach churning-a brilliant movie , but i can understand why people would balk at seeing it . another good film by greenaway was `` a zed and two noughts '' . again , it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste , but was intriguing nonetheless . the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is `` brazil '' . never managed to watch that all the way through either-kept falling asleep ! unless you have a taste for self-important movies which are off-puttingly highly stylised , laboriously paced and difficult to follow , then steer clear of prosero 's books .
i managed to sneak away one night and go to the movie theater to see this one , thinking i was in for a treat . boy , was i wrong . considering the talent involved , this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen . everyone in it was miscast , and i find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there who actually liked it .
oh my god . the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me . besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old . the plot , the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace . i am not usually this critical about any movie , cause every person has his/her style . but this movie , however , was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 . i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown , and i think it should stay like this , for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke . i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies , or even simply movies to stay far away from this one .
one two three four five six seven eight and back , haha . this is a must see , first of all to see the work out . there are a lot of work out shown , see those close ups , man you will enjoy it . a few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie . it 's a slasher but without suspense . the ending is funny too , and the clothes she 's wearing in the wood confronting the copper , jesus , looks like a clown . the killings are mostly done off screen , the blood flows but never too gory . there are a lot of fight scene 's too , and hey , no one got hurt . and what about the weapon to kill , never seen a big one like that , wo n't spoil it , you must see it . and being a slasher there 's a lot of t & a too . to guess who 's the killer you will be trapped a few times and that 's the best part , but what about the story of the copper in the woods , huh ! but still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have . i 'm glad that i have my copy , one of those slasher failures . but man , those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles ! if you are in your 40 's then this is one is back to memory lane .
okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting . the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci-fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on i found it very confusing .
this movie goes beyond just being bad , it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film , ( if you can call it that ) .
there are some bad movies out there . most of them are rather fun . `` criminally insane 1 '' was one of those flicks . so bad that it was enjoyable and had re-watch value to it . `` criminally insane 2 '' has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me , that 's saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst . but trust me , this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long . the movie has a rather incoherent storyline , but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she is n't being fed . well , you do n't see that in this movie , except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one . the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there , but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep . the camera work in this movie is just atrocious . this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15 . the sound quality is something else as you ca n't understand a word most of the characters are saying . to give an example of how bad it is , go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers , that is what this movie sounds like . not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood . now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words ca n't describe just how bad this movie is . if you do n't believe me , see it for yourself . 1/10
i have never seen one of these scifi originals before , this was the first . i think it only fair to judge the acting , direction/production , set design and even the cgi effects on the other scifi movies . to compare it to your typical hollywood production is unfair . i will say , however , that overall aztec rex was not exactly reminiscent of werner herzog 's masterpiece aguirre , wrath of god . i will begin by noting that , yes , i do recognize the fact that this movie has more to do with culture-clash than it does with dinosaurs . despite this being a made-for-tv sci-fi movie , there is some underlying context to the story which i shall examine . the symbolic elements included are evident enough . consequently , as a student of history , theology , mythology and film : i found the dialogue outrageous and the plot themes to be somewhat insulting . i am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of the producers - as i said before the movie is what it is . but what concerns me is that much of the younger demographic for this movie probably rely on television to provide them their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity . the main problem manifests itself most visibly with the character ayacoatl ( not a commentary on dichen lachman 's performance , but simply how her character was written , although , i 'll say she has some work to do before she receives any emmy nods ) . it is through her character that the spanish europeans actions are justified . her function in the film as the love interest of rios affirms that the european way is the right way , simply because they are european . there is really no other reason given . it 's really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the europeans over the aztec because their dress , language , ideology , etc is more familiar to them than the aztec - so therefore the aztec are portrayed as adversarial and 'backwards . ' and it 's not simply that the viewer is left with that assumption due to ethnocentric perception on the viewers part , but it really seems like the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the aztec were not capable of coming up with a plan - if not a better one - to lure a dinosaur to its death on a bed of punji sticks . in fairness , there is a subgroup of the spanish who are portrayed as looting temples and intent on simply abusing the native mesoamericans . there is also a scene where we have the christian holy man noting the achievements of the aztec : `` they have agriculture , medicine , calendar , etc . '' - but in the end it is still the aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the movie , even over the 'thunder lizards ' ( more on that later ) . he his portrayed as treacherous , duplicitous and attempts to dispatch the romantic european spaniard by tricking him into consuming hallucinogenic mind altering mushrooms - an important spiritual component to certain aspects and religions of the native meso & north americans ( again , more on this later ) so that he can keep the female he feels belongs to him and away from the spaniard . now in analyzing the true nature of the story ( leaving the obvious christian vs. pagan themes off of the table ) from a symbolic standpoint - a viewer can easily take these so-called thunder lizards to be representatives of the mesoamerican ideology/theology , which in this movie is portrayed as being one intent on : bloodthirstiness , mercilessness , cruelness , wicked , maybe even evil ? in opposition , we have this group of christian wanderers , led by a young hernando cortes who are portrayed as naive , yet overall noble , lambs caught up in the dark heathen world of the aztec . also , the name of the film is aztec rex , leading one to believe that it is about dinosaurs out to eat people . however , what aztec rex translates to is aztec king , a the head of the aztec state , or in this instance 'state-of-being . ' ( hence , why the title of the film was changed ) . and so who in fact do we see as the new aztec king at the end ? it 's the remaining spaniard , rios . aztec rex is in reference to the new european ideology which overcame , through disease , bloodshed , war & famine , native americans . rios symbolizes the ideal european - as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered ( in opposition to cortes who represents the 'practical-yet-still-noble european ' ) . but when you examine the holocausts of the americas , let us be honest : do n't the symbolic components of this film 's story have it backwards ? i have to say aztec rex is at worst a little racist , or to be kind about it , ignorant at best . and yes , i know it 's just a movie , all meant to be in fun , i understand , but so at the end we 're left with the idea that rios was the father of the last remaining aztec lines ? i wonder what native mesoamericans would have to think about this ending ... as for myself , i thought it was a little too self indulgent . best supporting performance of the movie goes to ian ziering 's wig - although conspicuous - it did at least alter ziering 's appearance enough so that i did n't think i was watching the yuppie from 90210 leading a bunch of conquistadors into the heart of darkness . ziering actually proves himself to be a more-than-capable actor in this movie , i actually bought his performance , or at least i forgot it was ian ziering anyway . i do n't know whom his agent is , but he should get more work . in closing , it was also a pleasure to see jim mcgee again . i 've been a fan ever since his all too brief scene-stealing performance in 1988 's scrooged . alexander quaresma - deusexmachina529 @ aol.com
( spoilers ) i shoulda figured . the dvd did n't even show the time or how long it was . i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i 'd ever seen . this one is much worse . makes no sense . thrown together plot . all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that does n't support them . it had to of been a student film . that musta gotten a c grade 2/10 quality : 1/10 entertainment : 6/10 ( until i found out it was n't going to end . ) the ending made no darn sense replayable : 0/10
like most people i love `` a christmas story '' . i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason -- it is awful . same locale , same narrator , same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking . charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i can not imagine anyone being able to replace him . the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original . the interaction with the neighbors , the bumpuses , is ridiculous . in `` a christmas story '' ralphie 's obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring . scud farkus , the original neighborhood bully , is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal . it would be pretty difficult to equal the original , even if this movie had been made with the original crew .
when hey arnold ! first came on the air in 1996 , i watched it . it was one of my favorite shows . then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so i got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it . i was sort of surprised when i heard about hey arnold ! the movie since it does n't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other nickelodeon cartoons like spongebob squarepants . nevertheless , having nothing better to do , i went to see the movie anyway . going into the theater , i was n't expecting much . i was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens ' cartoon like the recess movie was . i guess i got what i expected . it was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more . there were some good parts here and there , but for the most part , the movie was a stinker . simply for kids .
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen . let me say that again : this is the single worst movie i have ever seen . it had all of the ear-marks of a bad movie : continuity errors , bad writing , bad acting , bad production value , bad music . i thought that there were a couple points to horror movies . the first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you . this movie gets and f in this category . the second point is that when a character dies , or something bad happens to them , we are supposed to care . this movie gets an f in this regard as well . the first story , a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her . the next story , an ocd guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his . oh , and then there is the horrific , nail-biting story of a bad roommate . come on , could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house , being anal-retentive , and having a roommate ? turns out all of these stories where hallucinations , virtual reality induced by a doctor who in turn uses it himself . wow , stupid . let me explain something , i enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are . i could n't do that with this one . it was utter pain to sit and watch . do not under any circumstance watch this movie . you will regret it .
some have praised -atlantis : -the lost empire- as a disney adventure for adults . i do n't think so -- at least not for thinking adults . this script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . the `` crack staff '' of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think the dirty dozen ) but -atlantis- represents one of the worse films in that motif . the characters are weak . even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . an md/medicine man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix-and-match quirks before . the story about how one companion , vinny played by don novello ( fr . guido sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing . only the main character , milo thatch , a young atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by michael j . fox , has any depth to him . milo 's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head . and while the characters were thin at best , the best part about -atlantis- was the voice talent . commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner . although rourke is a pretty stock military type , garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . garner 's vocal performance is the high point . i 'm sorry to say leonard nimoy 's dying king is nothing more than obligatory . additionally , don novello as the demolition expert , vinny santorini , was also notable for one or two well-done , funny lines -- but i 've always liked father guido sarducci , anyway . also well done was the computer animation . the background animation , that is . the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter . aside from landscapes , buildings and vehicles there is n't much to impress . the plot was the worst . some say hackneyed or trite . i 'm not so sure about that . any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment . shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint . so the treatment is the thing . and -atlantis- obviously lacks that . i can not begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section . the plot was bad . the plot 's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense . to add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness . * * spoilers * * right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the `` coast of ireland '' should read the `` coast of iceland '' , we begin to have problems . the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as `` ireland '' , and completely ignore the older , latin term hibernia . but more than this , they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland . by making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated `` letter '' , the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post-roman date on the script . since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave . and without visible clues and less technology than milo had , made the inscription far less trustworthy . the shepherd 's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis , or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying `` in the king 's eye '' . it must have been written after the sinking , but without even the technology that milo 's expedition had , how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan . so how could it know more about anything after that ? and why would it be written in atlantian ? automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things . however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require to write in atlantian . so it 's got to be some sort automatic writing . since no-one left in atlantis can read , it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface . this would have made more sense . but could also have been explained within the movie : milo could shepherd have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life -- appeared in dreams , etc . this needed to be explored in the movie . the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages . no-one expects that the original indo-europeans would be able to converse in europe , anymore than romans would understand that hard `` c '' s or their day became french `` ch '' s ( pronounced like `` sh '' s , no less ! ) current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm -- when apparently they * could * read , yet now are unable to read what they used to , or operate similar machinery . the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie . nothing seems to have happened to this culture . it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it . even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival , no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy . kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in -- but any of it * * hardly * * qualifies her father for deification ! ! kashakim 's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence . killed a bunch in the cataclysm , stalled progress ( not a lot killed here , but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody , if they were n't boiled in lava first because the giant robots were n't there to protect them . a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim 's likeness , when kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis ! even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian , rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal -- which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or `` phases of the sun '' diagram . if milo 's grandfather had told rourke about it , it still does not explain how rourke would have suffered from milo 's reading it as part of the book . ripping out the page -- which was dog-eared in rourke 's hand , even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently -- only was there to tip off the viewer that `` something was not quite right '' . unless the word `` crystal '' would have set alarms off in milo 's head that somebody would try to steal it , milo would have suspected nothing . it 's just thick-headed foreshadowing . the crew 's `` double-cross '' was not a character change . we learned that vinny , sweet , audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning . however , the `` change of heart '' falls flat . it was a change , and needed to be better motivated . hard to do with characters who were n't given anything to begin with . niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome , instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from . it 's liquid ; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas . the ending stinks ! -- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness . with it 's powersource restored , atlantis is no longer a weak power , needing coddling . the giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might . the technology is superior to ours , and definitely to early 20th-century . in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read , for what ? the whole idea is to leave their little quiet , chastened culture alone , not to send it into hyperdrive . * * end spoilers * * perhaps , the lost world plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps . the failures i find with the film agree with this idea . but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well . and pulp stories is part of the `` crap they ca n't sell adults anymore '' , anyway . we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well . raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness . 4 out of 10 -- the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot , it seeps ever lower .
hobgoblins .... hobgoblins .... where do i begin ? ! ? this film gives manos - the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made . this one is fun to laugh at , where as manos was just painful to watch . hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term : `` 80 's cheeze '' . the acting ( and i am using this term loosely ) is atrocious , the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see , and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed . the movie was the perfect vehicle for mst3k , and that version is the only way to watch this mess . this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done . if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the bots ..... god help you ! !
hg is normally exploitive , and it 's never really bothered me before -- i loved `` bloodfeast 2 '' , but i really do n't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics . the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch . i 'm not opposed to witches , and i liked `` carrie '' ( the novel and the movie ) but this one bothered me . i think it 's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line . also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases . i was n't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then , but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited . what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless , unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99 % of the time and then just snap . nothing could be further from the truth . i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy . many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder . whoever wrote this script did n't know much about psychology . there were some decent concepts to the movie . i liked the way the witch used men ; it was a nice change . i liked how she could make herself attractive , but did n't when she was around her forced lovers . i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face . had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber , this may have been a decent movie .
basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child . at the adoption agency they meet a mouse ( stuart ) and they decide to adopt him . if you think that this is stupid , hold it , because it 's getting worse . stuart arrives to his new home , where he is treated like a human child . ( spare me ! ) the rest is pretty much the usual cliché , about family problems , jealousy from the elder `` brother '' , and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a `` happy family '' . boring and worn out as this is , it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way . i do n't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché , or he was just trying to fill in minutes , but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abhorrent . then why i gave a 3 and not a zero ? because of the family cat , who loves stuart as much as the `` brother '' . and because of some funny gigs , where stuart makes good use of his small size . on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if : a. stuart was a pet and not a `` sibling '' . b . it had kept to the funny gigs , like stuart trying to outwit the cat , and had left out boring clichés which do n't even match with anything else .
saw this piece of work at a film fest in ca . my god , what was the director thinking ? film professors should use this film as a case study on what not to do when making a short film . first off , this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . the film takes place partially in `` the waystation '' , some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere , where nothing really takes place . the acting is beyond bad . so bad in fact that i almost thought it was a comedy . the lead actress julia reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films . there is one or two decent performances , including the guys who played jacob and fenner but it 's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians . the only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue , which bordered on absurd . the writer ( whom i assume is also the director ) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain . the overall production value is pretty good , but to be honest , with a film this bad it 's easy to overlook it . the production design is pretty good , although the waystation looks like any ordinary bar . the costumes and make-up are okay , and i understand the production was working with a low budget . it 's just when the characters speak , or they try and push the plot forward , the film unravels into a muck of crap . as i 've said , this film is god awful . it 's like the director/writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this . my only hope is that he used other people 's money on this , because if he used his own , he 's a total sucker .
-might contain spoilers ... but believe me , this movie spoils itself from start to finish . i walked into this movie with high expectations . it was my own fault . i had put too much stock in steve carell 's record to date . 40 year old virgin ... little miss sunshine ... the office . and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie . it 's always been a very good predictor in the past , but something is definitely off lately . the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching `` blue steel '' in 1990 . this flick fumbled from start to finish . the script was flunky material . awful writing all around . `` murderer of love '' ? `` love is an ability '' ? whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty 's writer ( s ) ... trying waaaaayyyyyy too hard . the entire flick was peppered with three 's company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene . or the pointless/confusing aerobics scene . or the awful laundry room scene . right when you think something serious and/or real is about to happen , they toss in one of these terrible moments . and it happens over and over and over again . and what 's with carell 's character ? the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love ? let 's face it . their conversation sucked . they both should have said their goodbye 's after a few minutes . pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie .... carell 's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny ( i think the exact line was `` this one time when i was a kid '' ... that 's it . seriously ) , but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses . the actors themselves looked like they were in pain , wondering why they 're being directed to do what they 're doing . back to the imdb thing ... you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie 's promotional team off this site . i know it 's impossible , but it 's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings/reviews were either posted by 12 year olds , or by flunky 's hired by the studio . check out the family stone 's rating ... if that 's a mid 5 , then this absolutely has got to be a 2 ... and that 's pushing it .
i 've got a question for those who thought of this idea . why ? what made them think to make a second movie of this . if memory serves , did n't cinderella end with `` they all lived happily ever after '' ? i 'm pretty sure it did , or it was implied . wait a minute , if they all lived happily ever after , how could there be a sequel ? unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history , there could n't be a sequel . i mean sure , they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours , but why ? a movie that ends in `` happily ever after '' can not have a sequel ; if it does then they do n't live happily ever after ! something 's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending ! why ? that 's not right , it 's evil . that 's my final word on the matter .
unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of `` cruel intentions '' and `` wild things '' , but it is n't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics . it 's about the acting sheriff , artie ( taye diggs ) being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class univesity , but to keep it on the down low . as he digs deeper he thinks it 's much more than it at first glance seems to be . we follow alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . at about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for that . my grade : d eye candy : dominique swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of `` happy campers '' ) ; another girl is topless anti-eye candy : more men ass than girl tit
too much of something borrowed grade b- super bowl sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year . because of this , movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend . every few years a studio releases a counter-programming female skewing movie ( 2001 's `` the wedding planner '' ) to compete with the big game . this super bowl weekend similarly titled `` the wedding date '' will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game . sick of people feeling sorry for her , single-woman , kat ellis ( debra messing , tv 's `` will and grace '' ) hires male escort nick ( dermot mulrony , `` about schmidt '' ) to pose as her boyfriend for her sister 's wedding in london . her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married , and her ex- fiancé of seven years , who dumped her without a reason , is the best man . to make him jealous kat parades nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing . but ultimately nick helps kat realize that she can open up , and let someone love her . the film borrows too much from similar wedding movies . it is almost a carbon copy of 1999 's `` picture perfect '' and mixes in scenes similar to `` the wedding planner '' and `` my best friends wedding '' . the movie also has a reverse `` pretty women '' theme going for it , and knowing her audience , the director makes clever references to that and other films . `` the wedding date '' has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie , there is the stereotypical overbearing mother ( holland taylor , `` legally blonde '' ) , and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner . the twist at the ending has been done before , but it was something that was n't completely expected . the real reason why kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour . even though `` the wedding date '' is predictable , it is able to stand on its own . debra messing , in her first lead role , proves she can be charming and funny . dermot mulrony has great chemistry with debra messing , but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic . he is able to make best of what he is given , and be able to salvage the character . by the use of many clever puns ( often sexual ) , the film is actually funny . although primarily a chick-flick the film has components everyone can enjoy . the feel good story , and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time .
i saw this movie twice . i ca n't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie . i 'm also a movie/theatre director and i know what i speak . this is not romania anymore , but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september . no story , no plot , nothing . no conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . just empty images . what most of romanians do n't know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . they really believe that is the reality in romania . also for teenagers . pintilie should stop making movies . i do n't really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror : ) and we wonder why we 've got such an image in europe . this was a reality , but is n't anymore . a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said : `` you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu '' .
in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case . the movie tries to be funny , and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works . the movie is far from funny , and the story is ridiculous . i voted 1/10
this thing was bad . really bad . i mean , low budget can sometimes be very inspiring , but not this . the story was so off-the-shelf , the alien 's behaviour so illogical , the characters so clichéed . i found nothing good in it . and i did try .
i did not enjoy the film , joshua , at all . perhaps it is because i saw another , much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it 's really just because this film was not very good . i am going with the ladder . sure , the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that does n't mean the film could not succeed . it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building , boring , uneventful and really did n't leave me thinking anything more than 'that was n't very good ' when it was all over . at the end , joshua 's motivations are revealed . i wo n't give that away but the reality is that he did n't really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother , abby , disappearing about 3/4th through the movie , all arrows point to her returning home soon . she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua 's father/her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically . so .. should n't she be coming home soon ? wo n't joshua have failed ? wo n't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon ? i question the father since his future is left open ended . at the end of the day , i did n't care about the characters . the evil demon child joshua was n't really scary . the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring . suspense fell flat every single time . when it was over i could n't believe i had sat through the whole thing . 4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child ' go see orphan . now that 's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie .
i am from the dallas/fort worth area and lived in arlington for a few years . this movie was way off as far as making it look like arlington . i saw mountains in the background of one scene ! texas does n't have mountains . i guess that happens when a movie that is supposed to be in texas is filmed in canada . the accents are also really bad . they should have gotten actors from texas to play the parts . there a lot of aspiring actors from texas out in hollywood . the movie is really sad though , because it is a true story . i pray that the killer is found and convicted . the one good thing is that bc of her death , we now have the amber alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted .
i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real , who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that , my girl friend turned to me and said `` we have to go see this movie '' ... enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there were n't even any of those . it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall . i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music , there was absolutely no character development . the plot is just ... well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer , that 's brilliant ! hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless , that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me . her longest line must have been half a sentence , and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression . please listen to me if you have any taste in movies do n't go see this , and if your like me and do n't have a choice well then i wish you good luck , maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine . ca n't believe this film got made !
as with the other episodes in this made-for-tv series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend , horatio hornblower 's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense . as little wesley crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation , horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation . each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of horatio hornblower . immeasurably superior , hornblower 's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command . a perfect being makes for dull story telling . so superior is our hero , that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every move . what is the sense in telling a story about any person who can not do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time ? what is the point of watching such a story ?
dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy , spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor . to much . calm down , get yourself together and make us laugh . i did n't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars . just because there both up on stage or something ? he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star . i 'm sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive . he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru . i also liked the reese 's pieces joke . if dane just did n't act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating , as high as maybe an eight .
not sure why this film was advertised as a wild , quirky , laugh filled comedy . there is not much in this movie that will entertain , nor amuse the moviegoer . annette bening ( whose acting was touted as being oscar worthy ) comes off here as mannered , with her performance seeming routine . brian cox 's character is confusing and irritating , and the lead playing augusten  joseph cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role . the best thing about the film is evan rachel wood , but she is not enough to endorse this boring , unsavory film . the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason . i found some of the scenes distasteful ( the scene with brian cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'you and me and everyone we know ' and 'the squid and the whale ' ) , some embarrassing , and most of them unsettling . i found the whole experience a waste of time . do n't you waste your time
i work as a hotel concierge in washington dc and take my word , there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by michael j. fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $ 100 bills ! # 2 if i ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight ' time i 'd be fired on the spot ! the organization to which i belong ( les clefs d'or ) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously . # 3 similarly untrue was the concept , at the end of the movie , of doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . there is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization . this film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . in short it does a disservice to our organization . i welcome any comments .
complete waste of time .... this movie is not comedy , it 's not drama , it 's not romance ... not even teenage comedy at least ! ! ! story ... it should be some turn-over one end ... but it 's so disappointing ! when movie has a turn-over on end i expect that turn-over to make movie even better ( exp . `` fight club '' ) but this turn-over makes movie even worse .... when i watch teenage comedy , and i do n't do that very often , i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness ... jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity ... you got only one .... very good looking i must admit ... girl , and that 's that ! and she 's fully dressed whole movie ! acting is bad ... like soap series ... do n't waste your time ! there are porns with better story and acting ! ( sorry on my bad english )
this movie was bad beyond belief . i saw it during the 2004 san francisco film festival . before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before , which happened to be its `` world premiere . '' i do n't think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point . we all understood by the end . its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one . dark angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to bettie paige , in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old bettie paige movies . the movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least . a scene would start going then someone would say `` wow you 're so great bettie , why do n't we make another movie . '' this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a bettie paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as ( and even more boring than ) the normal part of the movie . by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another bettie paige movie remake came up . it was that ludicrous . i heard a lot of laughter in that theatre , but people were not laughing with the movie maker , they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure . this was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory . i know movies are expensive . i have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else i have ever seen . the movie looks like it was made for $ 12 . the cuts , the graininess , and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience . this movie makes `` dude , where 's my car ? '' look like citizen kane . my friends and i left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured . the only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good . apparently , the previous night , the night of the `` world premiere '' the director/writer/producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie . bettie paige 's movies were destroyed . they should destroy this movie too .
i am a huge michael madsen fan , so needless to say , i bought this movie without even renting it or anything ... this movie was so horrible , i did n't even take it back to the store , i would n't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison , i just threw it in the trash , never mind the money , it was worth the price to be able to throw it away . the acting was n't that bad , it was n't good or anything . the story was horrible , and the ending was something i despise . he was a broken man , alcoholic . his life was a bunch of junk . i thought his horse , peanuts , was an awful device to show his childhood innocence , a dog would have been much much better . i also hate religion , so this ending without a doubt angered me . jesus heals all ... i hate that i know people just like this that are huge christians and catholics , and time will show that god does n't heal all , or anything . it was a horrible movie , if u have the option to see it , pass , or better yet buy it , or rent it , and throw it in the garbage , and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
the title song for this movie ........... is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i first saw this movie back in 1978-79 when i first subscribed to cable . in 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes . ( or at least that when it was becoming common here in missouri ) . this might very well be the first movie i ever watched on the pay channel called `` the movie channel '' - which was called `` the star channel '' back then , they changed the name to `` the movie channel '' in the early 1980 's ........ i received a free month of `` the star channel '' with my new cable subscription . `` the van '' was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time . i remember watching this movie back then , and thinking it was a typical teen flick ( along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks ) ... the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties . i totally forgot that this movie even existed until i recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades ( i found a copy of it on dvd for sale in cheap bin ) i recognized it , and bought it for a mere $ 4.99 . seems like i had remembered this film being much better that it was ( is ) . however watching it back then was a different experience than watching now ( 30+ years later ) . it was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music , smoking weed , and having sex in the back a fancy van ( often all at the same time ) . this is what a good teen party movie should be . there is n't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ... he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out dodge van ( with shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it ) to get her attention , and he eventually gets to have sex with her . but his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him ( so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans ) .... he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans , and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend , he wins over the heart of a preppy ( lesser attractive ) girl that he half/ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier/better off and the movie ends . the movie does have it 's funny moments . but watching this movie 30+ years later , it becomes more of a trip down memory lane . because i still can remember pizza parlors , pinball arcades , it also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid ( sometimes i 'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we 'd screw in the backseat afterwords , i also remember many of the songs in this move ( when they were new ) ...... this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards ( brought back lots of memories ) the one thing that is depicted in this movie that i honestly can not remember is .... i never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being . i remember that era very well , and i do n't young men going around wishing they had a van . instead i remember young men in the 70 's ( self included ) wanting a pontiac trans am , chevy camaro or a hot rod ford mustang , but never a van . this movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one ( which just was n't true of that era )
i 'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the 'king of the cowboys ' ; made in 1948 , the picture came out a decade after roy rogers ' earliest pictures in which he had a starring role . roy 's character comes off as a bit clueless in this one , along with his female co-star jane frazee , who alternates her allegiance between roy and robert livingston , portraying chief bad guy bill regan . the whole story seems kind of muddled , with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so . like the legend of the 'hangman 's hotel ' for example , which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight . with andy devine in the cast as cookie bullfincher , you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up . instead , you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a bowery boys flick . it was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old genevieve , who truth be told , wound up getting more screen time than trigger , who 's contract as 'smartest horse in the movies ' did n't have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule . and then you have foy willing and his riders of the purple sage replacing bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers for your musical interlude . i do n't know about you , but it was already half way into the picture and i was still looking for pat brady - oh well ! yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough , and that turned out to be roy 's athletic dismount of trigger while still on the run from the bad guys . ok , it was probably a stunt double , but i have n't seen that one before in a couple hundred westerns . jane frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture , as she would in four other films opposite roy in the 1947/1948 time frame . in `` under california stars '' , she appeared as andy devine 's cousin , appropriately named caroline bullfincher . you 're never quite convinced what side she 'll come in on in this story though , since she starts out pretending to be someone she 's not , and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident . fans of the old laurel and hardy films might be as surprised as i was to see james finlayson here as the sheriff of sintown . i would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role , but he played it pretty straight after all . i had to wonder , when it was all over , why he and old vanderpool ( charle coleman ) wound up in the mine shaft with cookie when there was no reason for that to be . just a way to close it out i guess , with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture . i hate to be that harsh , but if you 've seen enough roy rogers flicks , you 've got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts . say , sintown - i wonder if that 's the same place that grew up to be sin city ?
after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover , i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good . nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features ... but when i played the movie itself , what a let down . it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time . the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film . so do n't believe it unless you like to waste your cash !
i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about . to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it did n't make sense . the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford ! ! ! he is so hot , but in this movie his hair was kind of weird . but still hot . however , despite how hot chace is , it really did not make up for the film . i guess the plot is n't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence . is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time ? the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy , camera shaking thing gave me a headache . all in all , although the plot was ok , i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic . that 's why i only cut to scenes with chace in it . lol anyways , not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like i was . oh yeah the cast was hot . the girls were hot ! ! ! but chace is the best ! !
closer to reality and containing more depth than `` breakdance '' , stan lathan 's `` beat street '' is still a pretty dull show . again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin ' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot , which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother , all growing up in queens , new york . each has their own unique talent . one is a hustler , one a d.j. , another an artist who creates 'burners ' , while little bro ' lee is a hot 'hip hop ' dancer . lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though , and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters . therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh ' dancing to save the day . choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes , but this alone is not enough to lift `` '' beat street '' to greater heights . unfortunately the film really falls flat late on , after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting . sunday , august 25 , 1996 - video
although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front , this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary . this depicts the funnest war ever fought , with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times . when we finally see some battle , it is lame : an enemy plane flies over ? shoot it down ( in one shot ) . sniper in the tree ? kill him before he gets a shot off . enemy soldiers in the woods ? not to worry , they gladly surrender . ho-hum . tepid , turgid , predictable ...
it is such a strange movie , you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon . strange comes to mind again and again . shot amateurishly , acted even worse and the directions , maybe none . the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit . see it if you got time to kill . but do n't , do n't even try to take it seriously . supposed to be a tribute to 'porno holocaust ' , . since i have n't seen it , from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad . should have given it 1/10 , but it did give me a good laugh or two , so it gets a 3 . excessive gore , the only thing somebody worked on . stay away if you are squeamish , more gore than laughs . wonder if the makers had a laugh making it ?
do not be suckered into renting this movie . it has nothing to do with an escape from death row , despite the ( english ) title . i ca n't think of a single good thing to say about the movie . poor acting , poor editing , poor directing ... laughable `` plot '' , and the sound/music was so irritating , it 's a wonder this movie does n't come with a warning label . the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for it 's historical cheesiness quality . they just do n't make films this bad anymore .
what a complete piece of trash . plot notwithstanding , when a movie 's action revolves around airplanes , you 'd think the writers/producers/director ( or anyone ! ) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details . the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie . here are just a few : i 'm glad i missed the sr-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the `` air force one '' f-117 spectacle . commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing 747  likely the ( cheap ) use of some boeing advertising/publicity footage by the director . exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring , much less multi-million dollar aircraft avionics wiring . airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship 's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air , and if they did rely on an on-board supply , the canister would be far bigger than fist sized . medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection . those were f-16s , not f-15s . mach 1+ ( speed of sound ) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff ( watch the airspeed indicator ) . `` standard formation '' is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile , `` route '' formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept . `` acquiring missile lock '' is not likely to get an airline pilot 's attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures . `` wait for my signal '' is not inter-flight communication for preparing to fire anything . depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank . yelling into a headset does not make it transmit . magnetic headings are given as `` headings '' not `` bearings , '' and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees ( compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground ! ) , so turning left ( not `` port ''  that 's a boat thing ) from a `` bearing '' of 618 to 502 is just stupid . it is in most cases impossible to just `` turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached ''  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again . the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely . airplanes do n't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back , and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi-engine thrust . flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension , not seconds before landing ( good way to crash ) . wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane , simply pulling the throttle ( s ) ( this time a different lever in the movie ) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed . did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f-16s and not f-15s ? guess i did and that 's just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie .
this is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman 's noose , then sets about `` taming '' his reluctant bride . it manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time . we never find out , for example , why a woman who won the respect of an indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband . or why the members of her team are so eager to get a `` real man '' in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own . this only made sense in fifties hollywood . there 's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip -- the second time -- then yanks her off her horse . never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye , which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip ! then , he prevails in a fight against her indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp . that 's some second wind . later , he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty indians ( as they all are in these flicks ) after they reject her now she 's his `` squaw '' . never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she 's been negotiating with them for years . and the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him -- yeah , right . like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail . finally , neither of the leads is convincing in their roles . madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky . fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot , but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy . the only reason you 'd root for her is because you want to see madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film 's end . the way that madison tames fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls . even if you do see them as dolls , the total lack of suspense will bore you . total waste of time . even the scenery 's kinda dull . give this one a big miss .
is this the `` worse '' star trek tos episode ? maybe , at least it gets my vote as being in the bottom 5 . i mean , this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense . seeing something that makes you go mad ? give me a break . this episode also has a different feel to it , the music is heightened , almost forced to enhance a feeling of distress , to the point that it sucks . give me some klingons , gorns , tholians , romulans , higher beings like triskelion 's or anything but medusin 's , these are very boring aliens to make an episode around . mccoy gets to utter his famous phrase `` he 's dead , jim '' . spock puts on the protective goggles when transporting the ambassador away but kirk does not . they go through that freaking `` barrier '' now for the third time that i can remember , boring . at least season three 's next episodes would be `` spectre of the gun '' , and `` day of the dove '' and others to follow , making trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would pick people like me up as avid fans . personal observations , trek loved to use the color purple , its kind of a pinkish purple , like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment , the gangway that is normally grey is now purple . we never had a purple bridge but its interesting to see , i noticed it in several episodes , it was done by a light filter and it works very well but in this episode , in the ships corridor is pretty lame .
as much as i love rodney dangerfield , this was a terrible movie . the plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies , but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes . in addition it was annoying and boring and that 's being kind . if you 're looking for a good laugh , rent a copy of private parts .
for all the subtle charms this student film may contain , was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo to show his paper macho face ? ? the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop . do n't get me wrong , i 'm all into exploring america 's dark underbelly , but this is a turd-a-flambé that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p.clarkson looks hot taking it . sadly , from a guy from wings . the best 2 minutes the film has to offer . if you felt like ripping off deliverance , you could do better .
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ... ever . and what is up with the casting . the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis-figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose . you could go to your local grocery store on a sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified , better looking possible leading ladies . i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a `` cool '' dvd case . this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college . i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television ... at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
`` plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms '' , informs one dopey would-be victim in `` the seedpeople '' , a silly , flaccid remake of `` invasion of the bodysnatchers '' , `` day of the triffids '' , and about a thousand udder moovies . and why are seeds moore dangerous than plants , one might ask ? because , according to the same dolt , `` seeds can chase us '' . yes , i can remember one horrifying incident when the moocow was just a calf , being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed ... yeah , right . unfortunately , the `` monsters '' in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets , some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds , others which sail about on strings . there 's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here . for reasons left unexplained , the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra-violet lights , even though they can walk about in the daylight , which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy . as you can see , not much thought was put into this cow flop . the moocow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here . : =8p
somewhere between the food court and zip 's , the mall in this film has an explosives store . this is the only place the title character can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale . a fictional town has a new mall , built on some land that was condemned . cute girl ( i did n't catch her name ) gets a job as a waitress there . she lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the mall stands . the villainous mall owner hires the arsonist responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security guard ends up dead . rob estes , eons before `` silk stalkings , '' is a photog/reporter trying to find a story . he hooks up with cute girl , and their mutual `` funny '' friend pauly shore , and try to find out if eric is still alive . he is , living in the mall basement ( ? ) and traveling through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his former girlfriend , including the arsonist . eventually , he kidnaps her and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the scene before the big kablooey . morgan fairchild is along for the ride as the mayor ... yes , she 's the mayor . of course , you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire story is in the title . someone named eric is taking revenge against people as a phantom of a mall . this also means there is no suspense . we know eric is behind this , but we still have to see estes and cute girl go through the motions of a silly investigation . watch as fairchild , who we know has been in cahoots with the mall owner all along , pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party , yet no one says a word as she leads them to her office , and her eventual death . the fictional town is huge , yet nary a policeman is ever called , everyone relies on mall security for order . eric has been hiding since the mall was built , but i am not sure where . he seems to live in a basement area , but you would think some construction worker would have found him . he also has furnished his love pad quite well , and found a few outlets , since he has electricity . it might be nicer than your own apartment ! pauly shore fans , both of you , take note . he tricks a security guard out of his booth by mooning the camera . yes , stop scanning celebrity skin and playgirl , this is where you get to see a grainy black and white shot of pauly 's south shore , although no weezil . this is just junk , and proof positive that i am down to renting just about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section . this film is not eric 's revenge , it is the film maker 's revenge for me being dumb enough to watch it . here is my revenge : i do not recommend it . that 'll show 'em ! this is rated ( r ) for physical violence , some gun violence , gore , some profanity , some female nudity , brief male nudity , and some sexual content .
now , i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash ... i appreciate the fact it 's a spoof , but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing , acting and dialogue . seriously , this rated as one of the poorest movies i have seen - it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper , and a poor one at that ... okay - a few criticisms ( 1 ) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster ( we never see the monster attack him , so we assume its a heart attack ) , the army then launch shells , rockets , bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive ( 2 ) the army attack from about 100 yards away , and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez , those things have a range of no more than 30 metres ! ( 3 ) when the monster tries to take the professor , the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling ; the monster drops the kid , and the soldiers do n't try to shoot the monster ? ? ? come on ! ( 4 ) the monster looks like it something out of power rangers ! ( 5 ) there is one scene where the five `` good guys '' ( the priest , the girl , the doctor , the reporter and the kid ) all look shocked and we get reactions ( along the lines of hand to mouth ) one after the other - so natural ! ( 6 ) the general just runs away , time after time ( 7 ) the general refuses to try electricity and would n't listen ( 8 ) the acting is awful ( 9 ) did i mention the rubber suit monster ? ? ? ? ( 10 ) that god-awful music , non-stop !
this movie is so bad , you almost feel contaminated by it . actually , there is a strong sense of relief when it 's over , relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and rush this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection . i jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where william hurt would `` phone in '' his performance . i meant that he would not be trying very hard . but lo and behold , in a huge number of scenes in this film , bill hurt is actually on the phone ! our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess . the cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled , the story is chaotic , and the soundtrack is barely audible . there is a very slight resemblance to `` falling down '' , but that film had a boldly disturbing story-line , great writing and acting , and an engaging soundtrack . `` contaminated man '' is just some kind of broken down old european tourist trap , and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you do n't speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up . you get the picture ? do n't get this one .
this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing . just because you 've got an excellent ensemble cast does n't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp ! think about it -- the film featured richard widmark , lauren bacall , charles boyer , gloria graham , lillian gish and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film ! the basic premise of the film is n't bad -- a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients ! also , the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife ( widmark and graham ) had a lot of promise . however , the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo -- with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film . in fact , it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of `` general hospital '' . subtle , this film ai n't ! ! realistic , this film ai n't ! ! while most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script , but i also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors . for example , paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent -- especially when playing gangsters in film noir movies . yet here , stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre european accent -- it just did n't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional . also , charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place . seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of america just seemed bizarre . overall , this is a rather awful film . it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly is n't very pretty . my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent . ps -- in a case of art imitating life , oscar levant played one of the patients . in real life , the brilliant levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions .
this astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians . from a ( silly ) play by tennessee williams and directed ( with a dead hand ) by joseph losey and starring taylor and burton and noel coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to universal in 1967 . the result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief . visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . the shrill antics of a screeching taylor , burton 's half asleep wanderings , the loony dialog , noel coward laughing at himself , the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer . boom is a disgrace , a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet 's plebs . not even fun . just terrible and mad shocking waste .
despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals , this movie is not for everyone . the story is very similar to other movies , in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age , and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family . she does that by choosing some kind of sport , and with the help of a local boy , that for some reason falls in love with her , she confronts her problems and wins . in girlfight it 's boxing , in bend it like beckham it 's soccer , and now it 's kung fu . but fighter is much inferior product than these two , it was simply embarrassing to watch it . semra turan , the `` actress '' that playing the role of a teenage girl , maybe can do a lot of things , but one thing she ca n't do is to act . her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy , the dramatic situations , in which she tries to show some emotions , are dreadful , her body and facial language are of amateur actress , badly instructed by the director . the rest of the cast is a little better , but they just can not save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot . besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer . even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this , it 's just so boring . the slow motion was really unnecessary , the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration , and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions , not actually fighting . not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys , and knocks them off their feet . the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it 's european . it 's very easy to publicize this movie - a first martial arts film from denmark , but do n't be fooled , it 's not . it 's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems , which are , by the way , not really convincing . bad movie with embarrassing lines , acting and story .
the plot of `` astronuat returns to earth as a mutating monster `` died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the earth 's orbit does n't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot the quatermass experiment was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . the budget is in single figures and i 'm talking about lira not dollars . there is no cinematography to speak of and there 's countless editing blunders . for example a photographer takes his ( barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him , then cut back to the model where the sun is ... the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers could n't get any stock footage of saturn so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful saturn looks we get footage of the sun . actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors would n't be employed by a porn studio . if i was appearing in this i would n't be scared by the eponymous monster - i 'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes . a general for instance does n't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . the tone is set early on in the film where mr melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . instead of the police getting a call saying there 's been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he 'd look for a missing cat . it 's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there 's a monster on the loose . the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish . i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of `` it 's so bad it 's good `` but apart from rick baker 's sometimes impressive make up effects it 's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure
in the first 20 minutes , every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director . there was the ntsb primary investigator with the tortured family life ; the politically-tortured ntsb board member played by [ i can kill any tv ] ted mcginley ; the tortured father of a crash victim ; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer . hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft . the crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap . the first third of the fuselage was intact , the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines . most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in iowa after it lost its hydraulics . most of this tv plane was n't even burned . it reminded me of the scene in `` air force one '' where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it 's made of inch-thick steel . the show was so bad it was impossible to watch . even my wife , who is more accepting than i , was commenting on technical flaws . what had me stunned was how this pos could ever get made . are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they ca n't even recognize them ? somebody read this script and said : yes , i want to spend a million bucks making this real . i wish i was the guy 's next appointment . i have title to a wonderful bridge in new york that i 'd sell cheap .
i never heard of this film til it played as part of a robert mitchum retrospective at the national film theatre in london . almost 60 years on the cast list looked tasty to say the least with seven names - in addition to top-billed mitchum - in the public domain ; charles mcgraw , not long off the killers , barbara bel geddes , long before dallas and arguably still better known as the daughter of theatre set designer norman , walter brennan , who needed no introduction , frank faylen , the sadistic male nurse in the lost weekend and the much nicer small-town mensch in it 's a wonderful life , robert preston still a decade away from harold hill in the music man with tom tully and phyllis thaxter making up the numbers . alas , most of them were wasting their time . i looked in vain for any 'signature ' scenes given that it was robert wise on bullhorn . by this time he 'd made around a half dozen films and had still to find a style . the story is our old friend the range war and mitchum must have thought it was barely a cut above the hopalong cassidy oaters on which he 'd cut his teeth . there are no new twists - if you do n't count the unbelievable scene when mitchum accuses preston of sleeping with thaxter to gain information about her father 's plans to move his cattle . this is perfectly true but how did mitchum know ? we 've seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it . on balance not a lot to be said for this .
if i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have ! i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year , etc etc excuse me ? are you ppl snorting lsd or ........ ? there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g ! i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap . i read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes , i totally understand that , i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once ! do not watch this movie , do something else useful with your life do the dishes , walk the dog , hell ... anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod .
ok i saw this movie to get a benchmark for bad but with this movie it 's unisol 's best movie now plot luc devereux is now a technical expert who is working with the government with his partner maggie , who 's been through countless hours of training and combat with him , to refine and perfect the unisol program in an effort to make a new , stronger breed of soldier that is more sophisticated , intelligent , and agile . all of the new unisols , which are faster and stronger than their predecessors , are connected through an artificially intelligent computer system called seth , a self-evolving thought helix . when seth discovers that the universal soldier program is scheduled to be shut down because of budget cuts , he takes matters into his own `` hands '' to protect himself . killing those who try to shut off his power , and unleashing his platoon of super-soldiers , led by the musclebound romeo , seth spares deveraux , only because deveraux has the secret code that is needed to deactivate a built-in program that will shut seth down in a matter of hours . with the help of a hacker named squid , seth takes human form . not only must luc contend with ambitious reporter erin , who wo n't leave his side , but luc also must contend with general radford , who wants to take extreme measures to stop seth . seth has also kidnapped luc 's injured 13-year-old daughter hillary , and is now holding her hostage . luc is the only person who can rescue hillary , because luc knows firsthand how a unisol thinks , feels , and fights . now there are problems like in any movie like did anyone find it weird how a reporter just-so-happened to be there and the soldiers can take being flattened with a truck however when vanne damme shoots them with a gun with one bullet and they die and the final fight scene was unbelievable when luc is now human and seth is 5x stronger and faster than any other unisol and luc can take a hit from him . with the final fight when luc smashes him to pieces i was really surprised that the pieces did n't melt and reform him ( terminator 2 ) . another thing that bugs me is how the hell does vanne damme get good actors to play relatives i mean in the case of vanne damme it 's completely off the grid of how science fiction this movie is . the music score now that must have a mention have you ever listened to a song where you 'd rather cut a blackboard with a knife well universal soldier 2 is like that . the good points are there 's no dolph ( hooray ) and unlike the 1st one there is only one naked scene whereas in the 1st one there are many ( i 'm still haunted by the scenes in # 1 ) also the actors in this have some talent whereas in the first one the casting guys were sadists ( if you do n't believe me look it up )
as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i do n't like johnny test . now i think i know what people are going to say , `` how do you know how bad it is ? have you ever watched it ? `` , i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just does n't hold a candle to my standards . i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen . like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation . i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount . so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show . it tries way too hard to be like dexter 's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female . there is a talking dog ( why ? ) , and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat . i have others but i do n't think i can write them here ( i do n't mean cursing but i mean i do n't know if there is a limit for words. ) . everything else though is spot on , even a deedee character johnny himself . it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff . lastly i want to talk about the jokes . remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling ? yes , yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter 's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke . johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50 % of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears . that is n't comedy , thats stupid comedy ( i know what some people are thinking . is n't three stooges stupid comedy ? watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option. ) . sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which , like chowder , makes me mad . i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together : to much bizarre does n't equal comedy , it makes you just think `` what am i watching ? '' . so it strikes out on all accounts . do n't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway , shape , or form .
about halfway through , i realized i did n't care about these characters in the least ; however , i watched a bit more anyway . regrettably , i came back the next day and finished it . i should n't have bothered . if you know * anything * about the film beforehand , you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what 's gon na happen afterward - he 's gon na get on the phone and call people about it ! that was almost as bad as `` snakes on a plane '' ( another bad aviation catastrophe flick ) . i realize this is an old film , and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today . but even by those standards , the acting was embarrassing . these were n't characters , they were stereotypes . i suspect this movie was , more than anything , an attempt by bette davis to help her husband 's ( gary merrill ) career . to no avail however - i have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did . davis ' playing the happy cripple ( i.e. , a non-glamorous role ) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move . it was n't . it was just boring . she was a kind of tiny tim in the film , making trask ( merrill 's character ) see the truth about love and forgiveness ( although she was less winsome than tiny tim ) , calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died . the final scene , where trask calls his wife back in iowa to reconcile , was so affected and over-acted on both ends of the phone line , i almost cringed . i had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film . i noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie . if you found it uplifting , that 's great . but frankly , i just found it bad . there are plenty of old movies from the golden age of hollywood that were far better written and acted .
i can find very little thats good to say about this film . i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people . i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography . michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor , and at no time no did i actually believe in his character . the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son . some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films , that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller . the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars , wondering why i bothered to watch it at all .
i 'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona , because quite frankly , to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth , is just an insult to any such director . i will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire ` office space ' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe . i can , however , compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it 's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they 're doing . haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they 'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production . it was cruel to let it live and as a result , audiences around the world are being made to suffer . the film 's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing , but for the sake of caution i will . josh kornbluth , a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia , is offered a permanent job . his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss . but ludicrously , he is unable to perform this simple task . my reaction ? big deal ! that 's not a story it 's a passing thought at best - one that should 've passed any self-respecting filmmaker by . the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man , with chubby features , a receding , untamed hairline , and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing . where o where did the director find this schmuck ? what 's that you say he is the director ? oh , my mistake . playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing , but i suspect that mr kornbluth is n't that convincing as a human being , let alone an actor . rest assured , this is by no means an aimless character assassination , but never before have i been so riled up by an actor 's on-screen presence ! my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes . i mean , as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel , kornbluth insults us further by ` explaining ' the action ( first rule of filmmaking : ` dramatize exposition' show , do n't tell ) . who does this guy think he is ? he has no charisma , no charm , and judging by his hawaiian shirts , no sense of style . his casting agent should be shot point blank ! the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt , with but one exception . patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex-secretary , who has been driven insane by her old boss , and makes harassing phone calls from her basement , while holding a flashlight under her face . this did make me chuckle to myself , but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film . the film 's title is also a misnomer . haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry . do n't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there 's a very good reason for that !
overall performance : - at last the long waiting aag hits the screens . unfortunately , it could n't set progressive fire in the audience . the first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of remaking the mighty sholay . and varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie . if he repeated the same ramghad backdrop , people will again say there is nothing new in this . different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy . right from the start of his career with siva in telugu , he had been using the same lighting and kind of background . i seriously dunno this guy varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis godfather . it 's all dutch dutch dutch dutch . why would some body use so many dutch angles and extreme closeup shots ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the shot division is lame . characters could n't carry an emotion , performances are not to their mark , storytelling is worse , background is really really terrible . babban : - amitabhz been over prioritized to his job . varma produced great villains like bikumatre , bhavtakur das , mallik bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of hindi cinema . there 's no comparison of gabbar with babban . babban is a more psycho rather than a villain , still he has a soft corner for his brother ( it 's a gift in this movie ) . amitabhz performance is not to his mark . his appearance itself is pathetic . the scar on his nose , symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema . what ever they worked on babban is not successful . babban is no comparison with gabbar . narsimha : - the first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands . if varma did that , it would be like teaching abcd to a bachelor degree holder . itz good he opened the secret early . but the flashback is pathetic . varma could n't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark . durga : - the only character with betterment . this character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story . heroo , raj , ghunguroo : - no body bothers or at least considers these character . the utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz . these characters carry nothing to this movie . ramgopalvarma : - his quality is degrading , diminishing . aag totally can be treated as a c grade movie . sholay is a fire of revenge , problem of a town , meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by dharmendra . aag never carried an emotion with its characters . storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters . do n't compare aag with sholay , still u will not like it . if you dare watch this movie . you will be burnt alive in ramgopal varma ki aag
i 'm going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought . i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count . but that would be about it . let me explain . i paid literally £1 for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks , b-movies especially . but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons ( which i 'll touch on in a sec ) then it failed magnificently . not only did it shoot for b and miss , it landed somewhere around f. this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts . i say above that it 's likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror , which can either be very good or very bad . for example , later freddy films ( dream warriors onwards ) are all about freddy 's style and nose-thumbing , which works out great ! but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid . i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good . in fact , for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find . but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills . for instance , when 'satan ' smashes the cat against the board and writes 'boo ' with it 's blood using its body as a brush . or when 'satan ' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman . now i 'm not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey , thats the point , right ? but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially . for me , the film went downwards from then on . one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it . the kid , dougie was just ridiculously annoying ! ! ! i 'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick ! i mean , come on ! ! ! i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid , like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help , but this kid took the biscuit ! i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it ! it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say 'duh ! ' one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like . why did n't i just turn the film off ? mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film . but i was wrong in this case . the ending did not redeem this film , it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line . i get it already ! the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else , be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume ! i get it ! this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid ! and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film , watch out for the intestines . frankly , if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that , i 'd be surprised he was n't already dead , let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair . in fact , i 'll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer . purely because when his 'comedy routine ' worked , it did work . all in all , the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down . why was the killer killing ? i do n't know . i can live without knowing who he actually was , thats fairly typical , but without some kind of motive - hell i do n't know , i 'd settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid ! -it just seems more than senseless , just stupid . stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid . in fact , i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it . save your money , save your sanity . stay away from it !
i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie , however this was an unique case . this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted . needless to say i was brutally disappointed . set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation , this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing . first , there are gaping plot holes . second , very few of the c-list ( i do n't even dare call them b ) actors can act worth a damn , so any scenes that have potential fail miserably . third , the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult , leading to very few surprises for the audience . fourth and most importantly , the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends ( setting/who the killer turns out to be ) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious . to the films credit , it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene , and i 've seen a lot . so , just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing , the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no , you really do n't as you run in the opposite direction .
christopher guest need not worry , his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers . the jokes are beyond lame . not enough substance to last the typical length of a ( particularly rancid ) snl skit , much less the 87 atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel . the great william katt ( greatest american hero , house ) deserves much much better . one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and that 's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i 'll save someone such a bad experience . my grade : d- dvd extras : 2 audio commentaries ; 7 interviews with various cast members ; 4 deleted scenes ; & theatrical trailer dvd-rom extras : 2 wallpapers easter egg : highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play , nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie . but doing nothing else nicely at all . a under-parr performance from the actors , law and caine , diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction . the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting . the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable , is replaced with a horrid , brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer . but this is not the clever , to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well , this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word go . this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing , watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act .
if you make it through the opening credits , this may be your type of movie . from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial . it 's all downhill from there . the lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past , and reconstruct the memories of photographs , to talk history 's overlooked genius , ada , who conceived the first computer language in the 1800s . the low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting , or even somewhat integral to the script . poor tilda swinton is wasted .
the story : young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness . she ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg . in the institution she meets park il-sun , a young man who develops a bond with her . if you 're reading this you probably already know how talented chan-wook park is . but ' i 'm a cyborg ... ' is a big departure from familiar , and ( sadly ) stronger territory . i 'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different . god knows , we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas . the main point about the movie i need to say is , that it fails to say anything about mental illness , or create a characters that you care about . this story has to be one of the weirdest things i 've seen in years ... but weird is n't enough . there 's no heart to the movie ... just surrealism and confusion . confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie . the characters all try to make sense of their own problems , but it 's chan-wook park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all .
this ( extremely ) low-budget movie is compared to the great classic `` silent night deadly night '' , since it is labeled as a slasher flick . first let me say that i think that even `` silent night part 2 '' is better than this ( that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie ) . `` christmas evil '' tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane , ( a strong word ) , slowly ( very slowly ) . he is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of christmas and at work he ca n't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love . dressed up as santa he finally goes on a killing spree . also a strong word , since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects . no tension , no thrills , no gore , no cast . for one exception that is : jeffrey demunn is in it . he is best known for playing aside tom hanks as one of the guards in the classic `` the green mile '' . he still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role . he truly is the only one who really can act , his supporting role is better than the main lead . ( who also is n't that bad , but if you 're overshadowed by a little supporting character , you 're not great either. ) . and what about that strange ending ? ( you have to see it , to believe it ) . `` christmas evil '' is downright boring , nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading . this is not a slasher . you wan na see a real christmas slasher , check out the all time greatest : `` silent night , deadly night '' .
i saw the 10p.m . showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special . although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back ( as i do n't actually pay for movies anymore ) i did n't really find any redeeming qualities . there were a few lines and such that made me chuckle , but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger ( in mind more than age as this film is rated r ) male audience . the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . i know you all want to hear samuel l. say his infamous line , but let 's be honest , it 's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg , which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen . now i am a reasonable man , i knew going into the theater that i was n't going to be seeing `` casablanka , '' and i am at least thankful that this film is an original ( albiet inane ) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off . however to be honest , if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .
when i was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had children 's matinees every saturday and sunday afternoon ( anybody remember those ? ) . they showed this thing one year around christmas time . me and some friends went to see it . i expected a cool santa claus movie . what i got was a terribly dubbed ( you can tell ) and truly creepy movie . something about santa claus and merlin the magician ( do n't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie ) fighting satan ( some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns ! ) . the images had me cringing in my seat . i always found santa spooky to begin with so that did n't help . the guy in the satan suit did n't help . but what really horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled santa 's sled . when he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements -- i remember having nightmares about those things ! all these years later i still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what i saw . my friends were sort of frightened by it too . i just saw an ad for it on tv and all those nightmares came roaring back . this is a creepy , disturbing little christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it . avoid this one -- unless you really want to punish your kids . this gets a 1 .
despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch . the murder-mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving . although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed . it 's obviously a pre-code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there 's even a song singing the praises of marijuana ! the performances are all one-note although it 's nice to see carl brisson in a musical but when victor mclaglen , as the police lieutenent , lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues , you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast-forward to the next number . pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though !
note to all mad scientists everywhere : if you 're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster , you need to give him a scarier name than `` paul . '' i do n't care if he 's a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land . give the kid a more worthy name like , `` thor , '' `` rock , '' or `` tiburon . '' because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing , `` ha ! get a load of this ! ! ! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds ! ! ! ! ! '' that 's the worst part about this movie is , this shark-thing is referred to as `` paul '' throughout the entire flick . it makes what could have been a decent , scary horror movie just seem silly . not that there are n't other campy and contrived parts of `` hammerhead : shark frenzy . '' the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island , and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest , and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching , which of course allows `` paul '' to come out of the water and kill her . the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live . but that 's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie .
they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love . the only thing worse is the film itself . the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital . at one point when the wife leaves the husband , a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack ! no kidding . the actors try but are defeated by the inept , unbelievably terrible script . direction is staggeringly bad . no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation . how do things like this get made . i 'm turning off the television before it 's over !
this would 've been a * great * silent film . the acting really is good , at least in a look ma , i 'm doing really big acting ! sort of way . everything is huge . every line is profound ! every scene is shattered by human tragedy ! mostly , i felt like gagging . yet , like any train wreck , i could n't tear my eyes away . this dialogue might 've worked on the stage , although i doubt it . on the screen , it was cluttered , haphazard , hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work . if you enjoy your melodrama in huge , heaping doses , you * might * enjoy the movie . be prepared to wait , however . for all that melodrama , this thing sure plods along at its own pace . this script must 've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves . it simply does n't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera . imdb does us a great disservice , at times , when it uses its goofy computer-controlled `` weighted score '' . curse of the starving class deserves less than a 1 . character-driven fiction is great , but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution , it is n't character development ! your characters must have a motivation . being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development . that 's a plot contrivance . stay away from this movie . or at the very least , watch it muted . perhaps you 'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do . oh , and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film , you see james woods in all his dangly male `` look-at-me , i'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man '' glory . do n't say you were n't warned .
this should be a great film ... meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers . mike nichols directing . uh uh . it 's dull dull dull ! pointless and predictable ! slow and unfocused ! it 's a cookie cutter 'boy meets girl , boy marries girl , boy has affair , girl leaves boy ' story . now theres an original concept ! after squirming through two hours ( was it only two ? it felt like six . ) i was n't sure whether it was a comedy , a romance , a tragedy or a soap opera . it was done in 1986 . i 'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget . i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade . it 's not that it 's such a bad picture . it 's just that it 's such an un-good one .
howling ii ( 1985 ) was a complete 180 from the first film . whilst the first film was campy and creepy . the second one was sleazy and cheesy . the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious . the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis ' . the `` scene '' from the first film was badly re-created . a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro ' ( reb brown ) to the old country ( romania ) to uncover the mystery to her sister 's murder/transformation/death . christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two . sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba , the head werewolf of the romania . she also suffers from a bad case of morning face , ewww ! bad movie . there 's nothing good about this stinker . i 'm surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he 's usually a good film-maker . the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it ( no , not the content but the film stock itself ) . to round the movie off you get a lousy `` punk '' performance from a damned wannabe `` babel '' . maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could 've got the real deal instead of an imitation . best to avoid unless you 're desperate or you lost the remote and you 're too lazy to change the channel .
the main reason people still care about `` carlton-browne of the f.o . '' is that it features peter sellers in a second-billed role . but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake . sellers plays amphibulos , a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt-poor island nation of gaillardia , formerly a british colony , now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war . amphibulos wants to play both u.k. and soviet interests against each other for easy profit , `` everything very friendly and all our cards under the table '' . terry-thomas is the title character , a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain has n't forgotten them , all appearances to the contrary . a positive review here says : `` the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . '' i would argue that the reason `` carlton-browne '' is considered below average is because the comedy is non-existent . after a decent opening that establishes the film 's only two strengths , a sympathetically doltish terry-thomas and john addison 's full-on larky score , things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes . the low opinion of carlton-browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia ( which no one can find on a map ) is milked to death . by the time we actually reach the island ( after a labored series of airsick jokes ) , expectations are quite low . they 're still too high , though . the island itself , which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean , is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport , and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade . the army is apparently still horse drawn , allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick-accented announcer : `` in war , the army uses many horse . '' sellers never quite takes center stage even when we 're on his character 's island . the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris , who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father 's assassination . bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written . normally this would make him the likely target for scene-stealing by sellers , but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache , sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year , `` the mouse that roared '' and `` i 'm all right , jack . '' strange that this film , like `` jack '' , was a boulting brothers production , with roy boulting here serving as co-director alongside jeffrey dell . usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything-goes comedy , but here there are only fey jabs in either direction . amphibulos works his mangled-english vibe for all its worth ( `` this man is like , how do you say , the bull in the chinese ship '' ) while carlton-browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve . the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris 's romance with ilyena . score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi , dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed . the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and a final bit of action by carlton-browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally . apparently he lives to see another day , but the film of the same name is strictly doa .
mighty morphin power rangers came out in 1993 , supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s . now as a fan of japanese action films and series , you would think i would get a kick out of this show . you could not be more wrong . what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers . mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot . now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie , yet , the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked . it was followed by two really bad , and i do mean , really bad movie knock offs , and the actors starring in this series , completely disappeared from the scene . if you must choose , try watching japan 's zyuranger series instead . also , what 's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys ? it makes them all look feminine !
when i tell people that i review movies as a hobby , the first thing they say is `` what do you think of such-and-such movie ? '' there are a couple of problems here . firstly , there is the probable chance that i 've not seen it and thus , i ruin my reputation . secondly , i could trash the movie in question without realising that it 's actually their favourite . lastly , i could be given dvds to watch so they can judge my opinion . thus , i find myself sat before `` the convent '' which is the sort of film i would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here . more 's the pity because this frankly dreadful `` horror '' is about as scary as a box of kittens . following well-worn clichés , `` the convent '' focuses on a bunch of american high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned , laid and mildly spooked . but you 'll never guess what happens next ? a group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition . will any of them survive and more importantly , have n't you got better things to worry about ? the only thing that saves `` the convent '' from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of coolio 's bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger . it 's far too amusing to be properly frightening - the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason , the day-glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie - but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered . but even if they were trying , i still doubt that it would work - demonic nuns wearing the sort of make-up you 'd see in the `` buffy the vampire slayer '' tv show are n't really that scary . the scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 % of voters gave this a maximum score . i mean , i know it 's funny but i hardly split my sides . to be honest , i 've had more fun in a dentist . `` the convent '' is n't really a horror movie as such . it 's more of a comedy horror like `` scary movie '' or `` shaun of the dead '' but you 're laughing at it instead of with it . i honestly ca n't recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then , i doubt very much they 'd enjoy it . i do n't enjoy the `` so bad that it 's good '' genre - i personally feel that if the film-makers ca n't be bothered to salvage a turkey then i should n't bust a gut trying to watch it . yes , it 's a bad film and yes , they really should have gone home and done something more constructive . a rubik 's cube , for example . the dvd box has two price stickers - one for £4.99 and a reduced price of £3 . but it was sold for £1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy , cheap , awesomely bad flick . sorry if you do like it but `` the convent '' really is a pile of unholy crap .
in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting , it never got there . the people are going from one point to another point , with really no point ( if there was one it was very dull ) . there was no action , suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless , so there was no caring what happened to them . all together the movie was pretty boring . i give it a 3/10 . i like that it was n't shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it did n't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous .
you believe in god or you do n't . you believe in jesus or you do n't . you believe he is the son of god or you do n't . the choice is up to you . director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure , social worker , son of two humans , instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary , who opened heaven again for us . encouraging the big bang , a world come from evolution , instead of seeing the beauty of creation . the film depicts a theologian bringing some `` modern findings '' to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play , who happily incorporates them in his play . the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy . more often than not the director 's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible . the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus ' life and the passion play actor 's life . this is an admirable attempt , but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor 's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus . my opinion is not important , god 's opinion is , but i would n't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus ' throne .
while the 3-d animation ( the highlight of the show ) did it 's job well , most other elements fell flat . it was as though the filmmakers thought `` well , it 's gon na be 3-d so we do n't have to work that hard on the plot or character development . '' and the fact that it 's a children 's movie is absolutely no excuse . the public is drawn to three dimensional characters ( shrek , nemo 's dad ) just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics . the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight . and the absolute kicker ? buzz aldrin 's appearance at the very end ( after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half ) comes on the screen and ruins everyone 's good time by calling the film 's main characters `` contaminants '' and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility . ? ? ? ! ! ! ? ? ? did you just wan na tell the kids the easter bunny and santa claus do n't exist while you 're at it ?
hmmm ... where to start ? how does a serious actress like demi moore got involved in such crap ? `` first blood '' might be rated as bull * * * t but this type of nonsense is just rambo with tits , point . of course if you are interested in the crapstory ( demi moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the navy seals ) that is the most stupid cliché one i can think of , you 'll say `` gi jane '' is a great movie . just the performance from viggo mortensen made this movie bearable but hell , i ca n't think of demi moore being rambo ( especially not during the last , useless , 30 minutes ) . ridley scott does n't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights , it 's just brainless propaganda for the american army and to make it more attractive they dropped moore in it . awful movie .
i am a huge stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it . done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this ( and larry 's not bad either ) . moe 's character is a straight part ( mostly ) and this movie would be better named `` the curley and larry movie '' . not that any of the stooges movies were very good ( in my opinion ) , but as one commenter here said , how sad it is that this movie had real potential . the casting was good , it was well directed , filmed , and edited , but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some stooges antics and musical numbers ( which i guess were good back then ) thrown in . the best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash ( which is subject to debate ) is to wait for curley/larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it .
there really was n't much of a story in this film . it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie . it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness . but there is n't much more than that . it mixes some scenes from the original , then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit . but still , is that it ? i was hoping for something a little more . instead , all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation . i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe , then this is it . but other than that , it does little justice for the animators . disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions . it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham . `` d- ''
yikes did this movie blow . the characters were weak , the plot weaker . i figured this could n't be too bad because it has christoper walken , oops . he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money . the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent . i am desperately trying to find something nice about this , i ca n't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character . find something to read , or watch discovery , do n't ever see this movie .
# 1 vampires vs . humans # 2 military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous , unknown vampire incursions . # 3 sexy female vampire on the side of the `` good guys '' . # 4 plenty of gore and action . there are four ( 4 ) major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie . if you want all four , then the next plot device may not deter you ... # 5 in outer space . that last one almost got me too , but i 'm glad i watched . in a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the sci-fi channel halloween marathon ... this movie is a breath of fresh air . it will stand-up against any of the other sci-fi channel offerings , and even against the other vampire movie natassia starred in ( who keeps giving uwe boll money ? ) .
we all knew even before it aired , the ron moore mini-series is no battlestar galactica . that 's fine . it just means it must stand on its own . it ca n't lean on battlestar galactica . if it 's any good , it 's good on it 's own merits , and ron moore has something to be proud of . if reports are true , this is what moore wanted . however , if his mini-series rots , he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on-screen , not to mention the myriad off-screen personnel . and this is what he 's done . yes , this mini-series is no remake . i would n't even call it a re-imagining . it 's a new production , inspired by battlestar galactica . it does not take place in the galactica universe , with the same places and jargon and technology . it does n't tell of the galactica 's search for the thirteenth tribe . nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica . ron moore 's mini-series is a space-opera , action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica . maybe i should say , `` just another '' space-opera , action flick . because as plots go , his has little that 's original , or even interesting . i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning . but i wo n't inflict that on you . i 'll just hit the most important point . ready now ? here it is : just watch the trailer . it will tell you everything there is in the story . yes , creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man . ( i guess they forgot azimov 's rules , again . ) they look like humans , so there 's the whole aliens-among-us thing . at least there 's no time-travel . oh , and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence . the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica , that ceremonial nod , it came off more corny than respectful . i mean , could n't he even think up anything of his own ? from the first few minutes , i wanted to watch something else . i did n't care about any of moore 's characters , since i could n't identify with any of them . this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack . armageddon on a planetary scale , and i did n't give a damn . how depressing . moore 's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle , instead of overcoming it , rather tucked tail and saved their own butts . after all , it was the only way to save humanity , yadda yadda yadda . they took the safe way out , rather than risking their own lives to defend others . at least disgust is not apathy . but in the end , the ron moore mini-series was just activity without purpose , a movie on a treadmill , forever running yet going nowhere . and i just wanted it to be over . and by the time it was over , my life-force had been sucked from me . against my own will , i was turning into a mindless , soulless zombie , probably of the type to which this mini-series would appeal . i needed to replenish myself . i needed to-and i swear this is true-i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 . two episodes , in fact , and i felt much better . and happier .
an absolutely wretched waste of film ! ! nothing ever happens . no ghosts , hardly any train , no mystery , no interest . the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful . everything else is pathetic . the premise is idiotic : a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place , because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes . what ? and the railroad leaves them no place to stay , in a heavy storm ? i think not . oh , they can walk 4 miles across the dead-black fields . umm , yeah . sure . or , they can force themselves on the railroad 's hospitality , and stay at the 'haunted ' train station . a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring , utterly without ghosts , interest , or plot . so very terribly dull that this seems impossible . this ought to be added to the lost films list ! ! aargh ! !
considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980 's , personal best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between hemingway ( chris cahill ) and donnelly ( tory skinner ) as a more than experimental phase of cahill 's life . it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers . also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole . this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie . i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie ( the 1980 oregon track and field competition ) . this review may seem harsh , but it is the truth . the exploitation of young muriel hemingway 's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film . pepper thompson
i was really disappointed with this film . the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it . then i saw pecker and i loved it . then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it . the only thing i liked about that movie was divine . she/he had a hell of a lot of talent . i was truly surprised . as a whole , i would n't recommend this film ...
as other viewers have mentioned , this film was an interesting experiment in photography . the colors are comic book bold . i think the director got carried away with his `` artistic vision '' over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content . despite its stellar cast , the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent . madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press . a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album `` i 'm breathless ( music inspired by the film dick tracy ) '' which was a stratospheric hit ( due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit `` vogue '' - which is not in , nor has the slightest relation to this film ) . i 'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna 's `` i 'm breathless '' album . if you watch it at home , by end-titles , you 'll think `` there 's two hours out of my life i 'd like to have back . '' save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this .
i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some 13 months old . i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry . i watched it again on tv a few years ago . big mistake -- the acting is wooden , the plot non-existent and the movie lacks merit unless 23 year-old t & a is what gets you going ... 0/ * * * *
while filming an 80 's horror movie called 'hot blooded ' , the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer . after all of this , the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust . so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they 're warned by people to keep away from the film , as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film . from this it 's labelled as a cursed production . not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role , but not as the daughter but the mother . but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film 's killer . look what 'scream ' started ! hey , i enjoy those films , but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses . during this stage the sub-genre came back with vengeance , but it was n't much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts , where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise . 'cut ' which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick . but you know what , i found it a cheesy delight . yeah , it 's gawd awful and highly forgettable , but it 's a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted . although i did hate it when i originally came across it , but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it . it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again , but this time it was n't so sweet . the film came out around the same time as 'scream 3 ' and 'urban legends : the final cut ' did , which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie . 'scream 3 ' is obviously the strongest of the three , but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends : the final cut . though , it did seem more of a throwback to the 80 's slashers than that of one of scream 's bastard offspring . pretty much the film is given b-grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances . the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense . while , the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it . she plays the wash-up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send-up performance . she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly . the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars ( that 's if you 're an australian ) with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts . also pop singer ( and supposed actress ) kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up ! nice . these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim-witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed . sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue , because they have no real substance to be there . the plot starts off rather interestingly , then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up , but then it makes a sudden u-turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre . simply it 's rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking oh my . this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner , but sadly it falls along way . but do n't you just love an opening ending . also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential , tongue-in-cheek approach . predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over-stated at times , but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit . the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness , but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added 'some ' spookiness . the cinema scene is done rather nicely too . now , now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick , but sadly there 's no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard , if lacking but it 's more then decent for such low-budget flick . there are one or two creative deaths , but the rest are systematic . the killer was n't bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought , well the smart-ass attitude did n't sit well with me . another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut-away editing , out-of-place soundtrack and kimble rendall 's direction lacked execution and was pretty careless , but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness . the imagination matches the budget that 's for sure , but heck this lousy slasher was n't trying to be anything else . pure schlock that 's slightly amusing !
and i mean ultra light . this film features four giant stars , about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that . there really is n't too much to say about this stinker , other than that although it has a couple of really good bits , most of it is n't very funny . nor does it work at all as a romance . how about as a romantic comedy ? not on your life . most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated , much less amusing . what 's really ashame is the premise is not bad at all . this movie could have been so much more , especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted , complete with phony quotes from critics . the film uncovers the un-mined territory of the press junket -- those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews . but instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes , it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film 's lame romance . the same with catherine zeta-jones ' character -- the whinny , self centered movie star . zeta-jones does a good job with what she 's given , but she 's given practically nothing . it 's all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we 've heard about stars over the years . in the end , it is hard to understand what made zeta-jones , julia roberts , john cusack and billy crystal sign aboard this doomed ship , which sinks like a rerun of `` the love boat . '' in fact , as the old joke goes , they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal . it would probably make a better story . so , go ahead and tell us , filmmakers , what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this ?
worse than the rating it has been given . this is a typical scifi movie nowadays : bad to awful acting , a script that is poorly written , and shoddy direction . from the opening scene where demille is burying his set to the end , this movie is terrible . in the beginning scenes this movie has moses ( which was charlton heston in the demille film ) , pharoah ( yul brynner ) and nefretiri ( anne baxtor ) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand . the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to `` supposedly '' be . the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance . the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert . i was sorely disappointed that morena baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality .
dooohhh ! my bwainn hurrrts ! well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film . how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows . maybe it 's me ! ! maybe i do n't get the premise of the film ... or maybe i do n't appreciate it 's alleged mystical atmosphere . in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to mcdonalds . in addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom & jerry cartoon . yaarrrghhh ! why do i do it ? why do i watch such tripe ? it 's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion ! ! yaargh ! ! an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect . apart from that it 's not to bad .
the funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot . so the basic idea is , the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one , but they 're powerless because the villains ' guns are just a bit bigger . i guess police ammo just kinda bounces of . they decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously , what is wrong with these guys ? they 're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers . okay i admit , it 's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire , even when the situation is so much to your advantage , but do n't go nuts . and why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway ? i 'd say that 's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you 're allowed to shoot . they 're like ten ft. away , they hit absolutely nothing . then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism . and then yeah , there you have it , one of the cops actually hits someone . bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something . i had a good laugh i guess .
america needs the best man possible to win `` the game '' so who do they hire ? a gymnast ( oh brother ! ) played by kurt thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas , a village of crazies and richard norton who is told by kurt thomas `` to keep his hardware in his pants . '' ( his exact words ) i missed this in theaters and it 's a good reason because i would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing i broke into at regular intervals . the first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass . kurt thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as `` the best man for the job '' as to the acting talent of kurt thomas , well if you ca n't say something nice ... in all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid . only the decision to cast tara reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here . for 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie i had ever seen . not to say i did n't find this unwatchable , i was laughing so hard i almost choked to death . twice . only in the 80 's could a movie with such a bad idea get made . although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy , he ca n't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground . this is the wimpiest action movie ever made , and one of the most hilarious also . * out of 4- ( bad )
without effective indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic motivating nuances of humanity , all this creative team has to hope for is effective usage of its middling , unoriginal elements . 'party of five ' gone maniacal then genetically unescapable there 's little rooting interest because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate bland awful-acting 'wes bentley ' mopester . in fact , all of the acting is skin deep . even though the dark-haired women appeal , the salaciousness is kept to a minimum . no nudity here . also lacking are sufficient buckets of blood . all sensations are kept at a teasing , safe distance ... an unfortunate fact considering the given name of the directors is 'butcher . ' only the soundtrack , the droning angsty alt-country and the tense fluctuating score provide any palpable tension . sometimes some static storyboarded compositions add appealing low-angles that adds to the malaise ... but for a film that calls itself horror , i did not even get close to flinching once . perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake , scenes directed with varying geometric shapes outside the square , and a sustained focus on playfulness through the family 's maliciousness or traps sympathetic characters need to escape in order to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion , but this was not a good start to my excursion through horrorfest .
this movie tries to hard to be something that it 's not .... a good movie . it wants you to be fooled from begining to end , but fails.from when it starts to get interesting it falls apart and you 're just hoping the ending gives you some clue of just what is going on but it did n't .
this was the worst acted movie i 've ever seen in my life . no , really . i 'm not kidding . all the `` based on a true story/historical references '' aside , there 's no excuse for such bad acting . it 's a shame , because , as others have posted , the sets & costumes were great . the sound track was typical `` asian-style '' music , although i could n't figure out where the `` modern '' love song came in when fernando was lying in his bed thinking of maria . i do n't know who wrote & sang that beautiful song , but it was as if suddenly norah jones was transported to the 1500s . the hershey syrup blood in phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the kwik-n-ez battle scenes . but the acting . oh , so painfully sad . lines delivered like a bad junior high play . if gary stretch had donned a potato costume for the county 4h fair he may have been more believable . towards the end he sounded more like a little italy street thug . at times i half expected him to yell out `` adrian ! '' or even `` you wan na piece of me ? ! '' . favourite line : when the queen says to her lover ( after barfing on the floor ) `` i 'm going to have a baby . '' he responds `` a child ? '' i expected her to retort `` no , jackass , a chair leg ! duh . ''
i saw this on dvd ( it ` s known as corrupt in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how harvey keitel ` s character frank is so much like the one he played bad lieutenant in `` this gritty and powerful police thriller `` . what the casing didn ` t mention was that this is an old italian movie . how old is it theo ? well when a character plays music he doesn ` t put on the cd player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . you see my point about this being an old film ? the dvd case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . it ` s also a film with poor production values like so many other italian films masquerading as american ones . with the exception of keitel the cast are awful though johnny rotten ` s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that i was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( i don ` t know if it ` s down to a dodgy dvd or if it ` s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is ennio morricone ` s score . it ` s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for corrupt is the same one who did the music for those clint eastwood westerns . all of this is a pity because corrupt does have its moments . it ` s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . just a pity the rest of the movie didn ` t match up to his high standards
this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen ( spoilers ahead ) ! first of all , the plot is stupid . the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it . we find that the kid has a gift , the `` shining '' . this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool . then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy . he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because ... well , he feels like it . why else would he do it ? all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub . the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse , which is utterly disgusting . somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe . then the kid and the woman take the black man 's vehicle and leave the father , who dies within minutes of hypothermia . most movies are n't a complete waste of time , but this falls right into that category . the music is trashy , the characters are corny ( except jack nicholson , who is a good actor ) , the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit , the ending is very predictable , the storyline is slow , tedious , and boring . this movie is extremely overrated . avoid this movie at all costs . i 'm surprised it 's gotten such a high rating on imdb .
do n't expect much from this film . in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in 1956 , title , julie . in this film doris , who was a flight attendant , stewardess , in those days , landed the air craft after her derange husband , played by louis jordan shot the captain . she did a far better job , more convincing , than kim ojah , who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower . i know a little about 747 aircraft , i use to be a flight attendant myself . like i said , do not expect much from this film , it was done on a cheap budget . the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it . oceanic is one name that several movies have used . the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft .
this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series . compared to the live action series this show is utter crap . the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines . while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap . the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it . thats basiclly the idea every episode . the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina . so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave . this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says `` just adore me for now '' and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god . ( which is quite right since he 's her mind control slave ) but this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort .
it was supposed to be the last freddy movie ( and it was for over 10 years ) -- you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done . but they turned out giving us the worst of the series ( and that 's saying a lot ) . the plot made no sense ( i seriously ca n't remember it ) , all the main characters were idiots ( you really wanted them dead ) and freddy 's wisecracks were even worse than usual . the only remotely good bit about this was a brief ( and funny ) cameo by johnny depp ( the first `` nightmare '' movie was his first ) . also i originally saw it in a theatre were the last section ( reaccounting freddy 's childhood ) was in 3-d. well -- the 3-d was lousy -- faded colors and the image going in and out of focus . also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary ( i think ) had the opposite reaction from my audience . everybody broke down laughing . looks even worse on tv in 2-d . pointless and stupid -- very dull also . skip this one and see `` freddy vs. jason '' again .
this is what happens when you 're living in china and the local video store is running thin on english-language titlesyou are blessed with this work of what appears to be , yes , romanian cinema . nevertheless , i think that it has real comedic potential . spoilers technically follow : though i do n't think that it would in fact spoil anyone 's viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery , even in flashback . that mystery , and many other conundrums , remain to be exploited by desperate comedians , perhaps when they 're stuck in bucharest . let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good-looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this . it 's sad .
tries to be funny and fails miserably . the animation is just terrible , looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep . plot is dull and cliched . if you have a young child , maybe rent it . but do n't waste hard earned money to pay to see it . 1/10
this show is unbelievable in that . . . what it represents and what it focuses on and . . . words can not describe how insane et is . they will report anything . if a celebrity is even remotely indirectly connected to the story et will report on it . if a dog poop in the tom cruise 's yard they will report on it . if a celebrity dies . . . they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity . if a celebrity is on trial . . . et will report it for months on end . there is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story . is it even considered legitimates reporting ? the reports are so dang annoying too , with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important . i can not watch this show without questioning humanity 's existence . et is one big reason i avoid pre-evening shows in general . i regret that imdb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the negatives . for this show deserve -10 stars .
elephant walk was a thoroughly dull film and i really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film . considering the money and cast , you 'd sure expect the film to be a lot better , though i also question the odd casting of dana andrews as a man who is in love with elizabeth taylor . it 's not just the age difference but i just ca n't see the pair as a couple . perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting miss taylor for vivian leigh at the last minute ( due to miss leigh 's deteriorating mental condition ) -- though i also have a hard time visualizing andrews and leigh as well . in addition , for an english woman , miss taylor does n't even seem to try using an accent . the film begins with peter finch and taylor meeting and marrying in england . their plan is to return to finch 's tea plantation in ceylon ( sri lanka ) and at first it seems like a good life . however , there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her . on top of that , once back home , finch behaves like a boorish jerk and taylor is miserable . neighbor andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her . however , taylor is n't yet ready to abandon her marriage . but , through the course of the film finch treats liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leave ... when out of the blue , cholera strikes the plantation . so it 's up to andrews , finch and taylor to work together to save the day -- though by this point i really did n't care , as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters , the dialog is pretty dull and you ca n't understand why taylor did n't leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hell . the film is n't particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by paramount , the film is a sluggish mess . i particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location , many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected ( and grainy ) shot that was n't integrated well . in one scene , for instance , taylor , finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green . then , when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them , the grass is brown ! it 's clear they really are not in ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining buddha . my advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake . despite its budget , it 's just not a very good or inspired film . by the way , could miss taylor have been pregnant during part of this film ? in some scenes ( particularly at the beginning ) she 's wearing billowy clothes , has a double-chin and looks puffy . this is n't a criticism -- after all , women do get pregnant ! but if you look carefully , you 'll see what i mean . also by the way , the basic plot in many ways is similar to giant -- a great taylor film indeed ! it 's amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much .
a pointless movie with nothing but gratuitous violence . the only fun i had was playing `` spot the location '' , as much of it was filmed in my home town of regina , saskatchewan . i like to support locally produced films but this one was a major disappointment .
for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight , i first offer these four words : do n't waste your time ! `` chungking express '' was shoddily filmed , slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king . i ca n't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane ! it 's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog ( a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that `` tears can be dried with a tissue , but water takes time to mop up '' ) . the same character is also seen carrying on a deep , meaningful rapport with his towels , soap , stuffed animals , dirty laundry , etc . the shaky , wandering , hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature i could have done without . and if that is n't enough to make you puke in your popcorn , we hear the old 60 's ode `` california dreaming '' by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence . quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company , though i can not for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother . he was known to have remarked , `` i 'm happy to love a movie this much . '' a lot of us , though , hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future .
whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot ( colorful killer commits crime , columbo smokes out killer , columbo becomes a pest in the process ) , the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes . this episode deviates in the extreme , and the result is a major flop . would you believe : columbo never faces the villain till the very end ? ! ! frankly , i was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through . oh , the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make ! ! !
a police officer ( robert forster ) in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station . after the murderers get off scot-free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court , he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking fred williamson . these robin hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute , and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him .. this film is nothing but a big bag o'clichés . the only thing out of the ordinary is the on-screen slaying of a two year old boy , which was pretty sick . otherwise it 's business as usual for this genre e.g involves lots of car chases , beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing . i could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare-a * * ed inmates , though . also , did they run out of money before filming the last scenes ? i mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure . if anyone knows , give me a bell .. actually , do n't bother . to conclude : file under `` forgettable nonsense '' . next ..
bloodsuckers has the potential to be a somewhat decent movie , the concept of military types tracking down and battling vampires in space is one with some potential in the cheesier realm of things . even the idea of the universe being full of various different breeds of vampire , all with different attributes , many of which the characters have yet to find out about , is kind of cool as well . as to how most of the life in the galaxy outside of earth is vampire , i 'm not sure how the makers meant for that to work , given the nature of vampires . who the hell they are meant to be feeding on if almost everyone is a vampire i do n't know . as it is the movie comes across a low budget mix of firefly/serenity and vampires movies with a dash of aliens . the action parts of the movie are pretty average and derivative ( particularly of serenity ) but passable- they are reasonably well executed and there is enough gore for a vampire flick , including some of the comical blood-spurting variety . there is a lot of character stuff , most of which is tedious , coming from conflicts between characters who mostly seem like whiny , immature arseholes- primarily cowboy dude and asian woman . there are a few character scenes that actually kind of work and the actors do n't play it too badly but it mostly slows things down . a nice try at fleshing the characters out but people do n't watch a movie called bloodsuckers for character development and drama . the acting is actually okay . michael ironside hams it up and is as fun to watch as ever and at least of a couple of the women are hot . the space sfx are n't too bad for what is clearly a low budget work . the story is again pretty average and derivative but as i said the world created has a little bit of potential . the way things are set up bloodsuckers really does seem like the pilot for a tv series- character dynamics introduced , the world introduced but not explored , etc . the film does have a some highlights and head scratching moments- the kind of stuff that actually makes these dodgy productions watchable . -the scene where our heroes interrogate a talking sock puppet chestburster type creature . hilarious . - the `` sex scene . '' wtf indeed . -the credit `` and michael ironside as muco . '' the most annoying aspect of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music they have playing very loud over half the scenes of the movie . it is painful to listen to and only detracts from what is only average at best . basically an okay watch is you 're up for something cheesy , even if it is just for the `` chestburster '' scene .
i rented this film about a month ago when i had nothing else to do on a friday night . all i can say to describe this worthless film is 'trash ' the acting is so badly done i 've seen kids in high school do a better job the whole cast seems like they 're just reading their lines out , no feeling , no emotion , and no room to capture the viewer . on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack . the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover . heck he does n't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters . there is no real murder shown either so this is n't a real slasher film either since i 've seen it i 've questioned a few things 1 . if is 'serial insane clown killer ' would n't that be a serial killer who kills clowns ? 2 . if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her ? sad really . 3 . why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden ? did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs ? this film is as sad as they come . my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming .
incredibly muddled , off-putting and ultimately ludicrous ( `` the horses , oh my god , the horses ! '' ) thriller . it 's creepy at times , but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film . watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody `` magically '' does exactly what the plot needs for the `` resolution '' to occur . bland performances by the leads , a typically eccentric one by richard lynch . the video transfer is a real hack job , cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand . 0 out of 4 stars .
considering its popularity , i found this movie a huge disappointment . maybe i was expecting too much from this film . after all , it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s , but i could never figure out why . the story is uninteresting . it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences . my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for , since the intended hero is an idiot . director chang has no sense of style , and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative . i know this is not supposed to be high art , but i found the movie boring . definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre . its cult status escapes me . i recommend you to skip it .
i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick . `` well lets see now , we spend 50 % getting dirk benidict , cause battle star galactic and the a-team were cool . the we spend 40 % making a demon costume , never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script . and we spend the rest making the movie . '' this was pretty bad and very cliche .... have a loved one present when watching ( or bring a good book )
they screwed up this story ! in the end nell is all heroic and taking on for the team to save all their asses from hill house and a bunch of nonsense like that ! they added heads getting chopped , wires cutting peoples faces , and the ceiling turning into a giant hand ! what the hell is that about ? ? ? i own and love the original movie , i read the book and i love it ! the reason why the original movie and the book are so great is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost . there is no gore . there is no ceiling hand . it is only the ghost ad how ghosts can truly kill a person . they can not kill us , they can not throw us about the room or fly a knife into our head . no . they can only drive us mad . taking away all our senses of security . nell was a selfish woman . she only wanted good things for herself . yes , she cared a little for the others , but not too much . david self and jan de bont have taken a crap on this great story ! i hate this damn remake !
my wife and i both thought this film a watered-down , made-for-tv ( bbc ) version of manhattan murder mystery ... which is itself good , but not great . the story has little inter- character tension or chemistry , and not much of a plot . woody allen 's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth , and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson do n't have a lot more to do . it 's pretty disappointing , i must say . ian mcshane 's role is just an expanded cameo appearance . the first thing that occurred to me was `` i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan ? '' he must 've needed the money , and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars . i 'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise . if you ever want something to have on while you 're knitting or sorting your stamp collection , this 'll do the job . i would n't pay to rent it again .
* warning . there might be spoilers ahead , if you care . * okay , the basic premise of this homegrown texas film is : college kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff . in practice , it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on . a bunch of frat boys , along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers , is setting up a charity haunted house . the project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character , whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible . i had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity : he 's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone , including his girlfriend and his buddy . regardless , the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin-carving champion `` pumpkin jack '' , an elderly coot who is described as the `` santa claus of halloween '' , and who drops off a load of props for the house , including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe-flashed prologue ( where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir-fry ) . needless to say , some damn fool starts messing with the book , and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones , and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive . there 's some good stuff in this film , but not much : everything is shot well , and the makeup effects are decent . on the other hand , the performers either underact , or overact drastically ; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a `` this happens so that can happen '' series ; there is hardly any musical score to speak of , just snatches of songs throughout the film ; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere . that last problem is the most telling : two-thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters . tom is a nice guy dating heidi the control freak , but he used to date jill , who is now dating dan the jerk , but she 's started a relationship kira the girl who wears too many shawls/capes . dan is a really big jerk , gary likes to play jokes , and steve & lily like to have a lot of sex . stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on , to the point where the lesbian `` sex '' scene ( calm down , it 's pretty tame ) left me looking for the fast forward button . that leaves us with half an hour of lo-calorie scares , a klunky ending and a deep-seated dislike of ol ' pumpkin jack , who i blame for the whole mess . unless you can get this on some sort of deep-discount rental ( and really have seen everything else in the store ) , put it back on the shelf and keep looking .
first of all there was n't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really . it was n't a bad movie , just another movie where i said `` well , that was n't anything special '' after i 'd seen it . there was probably drama and stuff , but it simply did n't grab me , but more seamed semi-dull . as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way . the quality of the film itself ( the images ) seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv-movie than a well respected english film-maker . the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion . did n't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes . i have n't seen many english films and the ones i 've seen did n't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work , colors and such . `` game '' tried to be more cool , hip & smart ( see my review of `` lola rennt '' about this if you wish ) , but did n't succeed for me either . overall just a little indifferent movie that was n't anything special ( at best , i 'm afraid ) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted .
the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933 , a cutting edge film for it 's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible . go ahead , take a look at the film , you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 , it was the first true special effects movie . come 2000 , computer aided special effects seem like child 's play , audiences are not blown away by special effects , instead they are disappointed if they are not done right . the special effects in hollow man , the update of the hg wells story , are ok , but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven , who you might remember from showgirls and total recall . kevin bacon plays sebastian caine , a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation ( yeah , i know that 's not a word ) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team 's funding . so , as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do , he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation ( yeah , i know , i used that non-word again ) process . the process has dire consequences , no caine does not die , but instead becomes a horny , violent creature , aka a guy . now that he 's invisible , caine stalks a sexy neighbor , a co-worker , former girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) , and the man who took away his funding . then a funny thing happens , caine becomes a new supernatural being , `` the thing that wo n't die . '' laughing in the face of all things natural , caine faces down death and spits in it 's face , as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die , dragging the ending of the movie out . the movie is silly , stupid , and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used , sometimes not . there are neat possibilities in hollow man , but of course , not one of them is explored . for a more interesting look at an invisible being , get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema , and check out the 1933 invisible man . kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back , probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano .
where to begin ? anachronism ? high tech cross bow with a scope in about 500ad ? arrows with explosive charges in 500ad ? a monster grendel that looks like a robocop and obviously never interacts with any of the weapons fired or swung against him ? the heart torn out of his victim 's chest without any sense of contact ? possibly the blond who would fit in on a recent fashion show with her make-up and streaked hair ? the ancient danish court represented in classical greek style ? the queen played by marina sirtis more savaged by her makeup artist than by madness ? the effects are way too weak to carry this story . there are some stories that do n't mind or even benefit from cheap effects , but this grendel is n't one of them . what about characters who seem to jump about in their attitudes without motivation ? a bravado idiot prince whose home has already been savaged more than once by the monster grendel seems to have less respect for the danger he faces than beowulf who was sent from afar from the land of the geats to help the desperate danes . in this it feels more like an old cowboy western than any kind of myth . beowulf is an ancient tale from an era with almost no literary tradition and much of both its sentiment and its drama is obscure . i suspect that any modern telling which does n't make an intelligent attempt to penetrate the obscurity must fail . i did n't love the recent `` beowulf and grendel '' which sees grendel essentially as human and sees hrothgar and his danes as too arrogant and stupid to recognize grendel 's attacks as well-justified vengeance , but i had to respect its revisionist position that hrothgar 's danes were a bunch of macho thugs who never grasped , even after it was all over , that they had brought this nightmare on themselves , and therefore , the original story of beowulf , as it was written , was a misrepresentation of the real story . i think there 's a more complex meaning to be understood than that , but this `` grendel 's '' terrible secret that grendel 's attacks are tied to previous human sacrifice does n't really bring us closer to the shame experienced by hrothgar and the danes . this beowulf has little to recommend it as traditional myth or as modern fantasy . i give it a 4 : higher than it deserves , but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently . in the meantime , sci-fi 's movie-making seems to be following the nasa policy that it 's better to build lots of probes that fail than a few that succeed .
watching `` kroko '' i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life . i would not recommend to watch this movie : flat main characters - absolutely no development e.g . kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot-wise chances to do so . uninspired actors , non-evolving plot . i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed : camera appeared shaky rather than motivated . pictures were low - contrast , gray and dark - i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu . the story had certain potential though , it could have made a good short story .
i really wanted to like this film , but the story is ridicules . i do n't want to spoil this film , - do n't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here 's an example of how sloppy this film was put together . the cowboy and `` twig '' ride up the ridge . the cowboy has a handle bar mustache . the cowboy and `` twig '' get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge . the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film . sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave , in dark , on the back of a horse . to be fair , the acting by the four main characters is solid .
stupid ! stupid ! stupid ! i can not stand ben stiller anymore . how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me . i ca n't understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i 'd get fired and i own the company ..... i would have to fire myself . god ! this movie was just a plain , steaming , stinking pile of poo , that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible . something else i have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic . what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie ? i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary .
we gave up at the point where george clooney 's character has his finger-nails extracted . we were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like . to say this film was incomprehensible , boring , pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it ! how did people manage to sit through this confusing , slow , depressing pseud 's corner of a film , let alone nominate it for an oscar ? clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him . what was he thinking ? oh .. and what was with those subtitles ? - did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air ? the film was hard enough to follow without that as well . i pity the cast , who obviously did their best with the material available .
hayden christianson and jessica alba two of my least favourite actors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the flattest attempt at remake the already dire the butterfly effect . awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you 'd be better off asleep . terrance howard still recovering from the diabolical august rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing christianson and after viewing his performance i would gladly assists . alba , still recovering after fantastic four rise of the silver surfer . is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was . only once has she ever been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director robert rodriguez in sin city . could it possibly be that jessica alba is n't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script . if so then that would explain awake . what with a script that would shame that of plan 9 from outer space . jessica alba , hayden christenson , and terrence howard star in first-time director/screenwriter joby harold 's nerve-jangling psychological thriller about a man who experiences the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as `` aesthetic awareness , '' in which those laid out on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely paralyzed and unable to cry out for help . when a successful young young man ( christenson ) goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia has n't quite done its job , the horror quickly sets in as his worried wife ( alba ) waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room . hoping to do for operating tables what final destination did for planes , this first effort from director joby harold pivots on a blood-frosting conceit . the pre-credits sequence tells us one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as 'anaesthetic awareness ' , where the patient remains conscious but paralysed during surgery . one such unfortunate individual is clayton beresford jr ( hayden christensen ) , who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every single slice . intermittently inventive as it probes away at his tortured psyche , awake fails to inject true terror into its novel premise . spiralling from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy , it 's hindered by stilted turns from christensen and jessica alba . you 'll wish you 'd popped a sedative before watching verdict : awake is at very best extremely undemanding . a pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper . as a film though its awfully generic and extremely derived . awake fails to inject terror into its novel premise . the end result is really quite lousy . alba and christian are the very least of your worries as the films main flaw lies in its inability to scare its audience . awake is a film you 'll most likely sleep through .
mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made . there is no plot , just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits . the special effects look like they are from the '70 's , the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy , and the show is just plain awful . the only thing worse than the television show are the toys , just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids . there are far better shows for your kids to watch ! try giving your kids something like nickelodean , those shows actually have some intelligence behind them , unlike power rangers .
i love memoirs of a geisha so i read the book twice ; it is one of the best book i 've read last year . i was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie . i was n't expecting the movie to be that bad . some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with hatsumomo ( li gong ) been the worst . if i have n't read the book , this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable . the plot outline of the movie states `` nitta sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing ... '' did anyone see how or when sayuri became nitta sayuri ? forget the movie and read the book .
i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment ! i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger , and i thought he was great , but this movie was really bad . i do n't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula , with style , looks , attraction and the evil underneath that . or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me . but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it ? do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension .. ? then this is a movie for you ! otherwise - do n't see it ! i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie . sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you . maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home . cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid , and i think that sums up the whole thing ! or maybe you like this film because of it 's place in dracula cinema history , perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today . cause as movie it is n't that appealing , it does n't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating . and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it . the scenery looks like cheap theatre . and i do n't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies . cause i can love old film as well as new .
spoilers . strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film . allow me to add balance by pointing out the following : script : dreadful . as tom and dan are `` getting to know each other , '' bantering about films , the talk is clearly that of one person , and i suspect it was the director , who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent . at one point , dan asks , `` have you heard of the hiv virus ? '' and it sounds about as natural as asking , `` have you communicated with the nine alien races ? '' acting : white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make . speedman did well enough with what he was given , i suppose , but marsden was terrible -- unsympathetic , unbelievable , and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity . there is an emptiness to his performances ( also see interstate 60 ) . plot : spare me ! the moments of half-escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak . recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down : `` they do n't work , man ! '' tee-hee . and beware the semi black-and-white flashbacks , which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas . most important of all , most dangerous , evil , and offensive , is the homophobia ( external or internal , you decide ) in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon . tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all -- excuse me , where was tom while they were having sex ? there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in general . in sum : beware !
this film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice `` demons '' and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . the acting is terrible , the action scenes are speeded up , the script is almost painful and budget non existent . if you think this film is good then you hav n't seen a real horror film , skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .
99.999 % pure crap . and the other .001 % was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe . nope . the dialogue was legendarily bad . the action sucked , and there was no sex ( the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed , alas , the whole movie ) . the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i 've ever seen on film , and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring . acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis , the only 'names ' in this movie . and marina sirtis looked really , really bad . i 've seen high school plays more capably produced . this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on . heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air .
seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio `` zombi '' fulci might be up to his old tricks . unfortunately , other than the close ups of a rotting corpse , there 's little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter 's quest to figure out who killed him . none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it ( that twist , at least , was cool ) , you stop caring . the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert !
there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film . there 's not one scary , funny , or even interesting scene in this film . it advertises itself as a horror , then goes on to call itself a comedy . it does n't even attempt humor . neither does it attempt to be scary . in order to not be bored by this film , you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth . if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all . i 'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this . its not funny , scary , shocking , or intriguing . so was it supposed to be a drama ? because it really was n't dramatic either . please just do yourself a favor and do n't watch this film . life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this .
it used to be my thinking that movies required plots , or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on . this movie has showed me that you do n't actually have to have anything like that . i could sum it up simply as that . but , imdb wants me to have more lines . it was kind of pretty . not compelling in the slightest . the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days , but there is no passage of time and i 'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour . if you are looking to entertain yourself , then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up . it would be a far better use of your time . time that you will never get back . jurassic park 3 was pulled off better than this movie .
the only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves . for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three . the story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave , but for any wave at all . j.c. ( sean pertwee ) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend chloe ( catherine zeta jones ) . just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves , three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the bone yard . the trouble is , there are no waves until the very end of the film , so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings . the acting is mostly mediocre . sean pertwee has a few comical moments , but mostly his acting was mundane . ewan mcgregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man , by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch . probably the funniest performance was turned in by peter gunn as terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag . catherine zeta-jones was sexy as usual , but her character did n't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability . there is really not much here on which to comment . i rated it a 3/10 . it 's a real beach bummer .
this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty page 's ( paige richards ) career . the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history . her most memorable work came in the 1950 's and was fetish photos , bondage and cat-fight `` girly flicks '' . irving klaw ( dukey flyswatter ) at his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera . there was no nudity in the famous photos or `` stag films '' , but nonetheless , klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution . it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career . the girl-next-door with jet black hair , blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades . after all , it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world , elvis presley . betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion . this movie actually could have been a lot better ; but good enough to hold interest . miss richards is stunning in her own right . bra , panties , garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least . also in the cast : jaimie henkin , jana strain , emily marilyn and julie simone . be advised this movie can change your heart rate .
let 's be honest here : the only reason anyone bought this , the only reason anyone reviewed this , and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because david lynch made it and because you want to have david lynch 's children . but guess what ? even david lynch can produce a piece of crap . maybe lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in-itself as a pure subject-of-knowing . maybe the atrocious , cacophonist sounds , and chicken-scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity 's place in the world , about our relation to the real , about the absurdity of it all . instead , it just says one thing to me : i just lost $ 20 . if i wanted offensive for the sake of offensive , i could crank hansen on high and let me ears bleed . if i wanted absurd for the sake of absurd , i could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes . there is a single redeeming quality to dumbland -- it is meta , meta funny . that is , it is so bad that it is n't even funny because it 's so bad . this fact , however , is a little funny . if you hate yourself and hate your money , then buy dumbland . if not , spare yourself the agony .
i watched this movie on march 21 this year.must say disappointment.but much better than `` tridev '' .plot is hackneyed.tells about prabhat who lives with his father , wife and his little brother.the movie opens when he saves a bride.anyway.azghar jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother.he makes a plan by sending few man.they come to a school pretended to be prabhats friends.kill that kid.his father throws him out of the house.then later comes back.he and aakash go to kenya to find him.sunny gives a good performance , chunky was annoying at best , naseerdun is wasted.divya did good , sonam was wasted , jyotsna was wasted but looked cute.the kid which played sunnys brother in the movie was cute.too sad he had to get his character killed.the girl was cute but was annoying.the other kid did good.alok did good.kiran was adequate.amrish and gulshan did good.the cinematography is excellent in both india and kenya.script is weak but has a few good dialogs.also drags .the movie.the music was alright.i only liked one song '' saat samundar '' the lyrics of that song was good.the other songs were forgettable.do n't watch this . rating-3/10
spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help . i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point . lee 's first movie with an all-white cast is a major disappointment . what 's the point ? that italians swear and like funky sex , but not with their wives ? if i wanted to see scorsese , i 'd go to a scorsese movie . the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype . i 've admired several of lee 's films , especially `` do the right thing '' . this movie is a waste of time .
first of all i would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called the flying dutchman . in this film , you will not see a single sailing boat . you will not see sailors , ghosts , or anything remotely exciting . it is not the story of the ghost ship , and i wish they had notified it in the main credits or i would n't have watched it , because i really thought it was the film about the legend . it seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship , since the film is listed on the wikipedia page for the `` flying dutchman '' legend ... i do n't understand why . it is maybe based on the resembling legend called `` the wandering jew '' ? or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend ? the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes . unfortunately , it is the only battle scene of the film . then you see daniel emilfork ( who was krank in city of lost children ) for about two seconds , and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting . unfortunately he is very bad in the film . the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi , who was one of italia 's best actors ever , and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the `` wise man '' of the film . and boy , does that film need wiseness ! every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement , yelling , torturing others ( in excrement ) , fornicating ( in excrement ) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it . it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another . coming from a dutch director , you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece , elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven 's film , `` flesh + blood '' , such a great film . the thought of `` flesh + blood '' would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good . unfortunately , and unlike `` flesh + blood '' , there is no dramatic progression , no fights , no good acting , and put simply , no `` flesh and blood '' . the photography , as the opening sequence unfolds , is well-done and enticing . this too , stops very early in the film . the music , from nicola piovani ( of `` la vità e bella '' fame ) is repetitive and annoying , when not irrelevant ( it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence , while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung ) . throughout the first `` act '' of the film , which lasts nothing less than an hour ( ! ) , the film takes place within the same perimeter , which is around the farm where the main characters live . the characters play with excrement a lot , drown in it , play in it . a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character , a young boy who loves to play in excrement , to become older and play in excrement some more . the bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian . spanish conquistadors speak french . nothing makes sense . everything is confused and takes hours to happen . then there is a second act called `` the ship '' , in which we see what might have been a ship , a long time ago , but which is now remains of a ship ( covered with excrement did i mention ? ) . the main character , while walking a bit further away from the farm , just happens to run into it , and decides it 's really cool so let 's live in it . the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him , but he does n't really mind because ( did i mention ? ) he 's not very bright . he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it , until more conquistadors show up ( at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i 've said it 's really confused who 's who ) , make the dutchman a prisoner , along with the retarded hunchback , and they burn the ship to the ground . the last part of the film , which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it , takes place in a mad asylum . yet more torture and drowning each other with feces . yet more loitering for the director , who seems to have definitely given up on his job , or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job . in the end , a lot of the mentally-challenged new `` friends '' that the dutchman made die . the woman he had sex with who was his brother 's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son . the dutchman and his son talk . the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances . then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends , while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they do n't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses .
really , when it comes down to it , this movie is just not funny . josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny , and yet he thinks he 's hilarious . the plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first , until josh 's `` look at me , i 'm wacky '' approach began infesting each and every scene . the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to , and that is saying quite a bit , since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie . and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies ' `` debaser , '' i have just one thing to say : what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this ? what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a terrible movie ?
as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies . most if them i never understand . i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood . last week i watched a film called `` the polish wedding '' together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched . unfortunately i was wrong this movie `` house of angels '' is even worse . none of the actors can act , absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom . the plot is so silly nobody can believe it.i think the whole thing is a mess from the start . lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter . ahmed sellam
i was expecting a b-movie french musical . after all , dhéry , blanche , defunès were superstars of low budget french films of that time . and it is in color ! but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity . musical numbers are awful , and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid . and the songs ? what songs ? this is just a succession of bad numbers , one after another . the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women . it was not familiar at that time . in fact , some numbers are just there to show us topless women . it adds to the mediocrity ! and try to find young michel serrault , the future great actor of french cinema , in a bit part as a musician , in his very first movie . good luck !
set in a post-apocalyptic environment , cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population . they basically keep them as livestock , as they need fresh human blood to live off . nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid , and years have past when she came face-to-face with the cyborgs again , but this time she 's saved by the cyborg gabriel , who was created to destroy all cyborgs . job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city , while nea ( with revenge on mind ) pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she 'll get him to gabriel . cheap low-rent cyborg / post-apocalyptic foray by writer / director albert pyun ( who made `` cyborg '' prior to it and the blistering `` nemsis '' the same year ) is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties . very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story , as the turgid script is weak , corny and overstated . the leaden banter tries to be witty , but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments . most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine . the material could 've used another polish up , as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions , lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone . the open-ended , cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt , especially since a sequel has yet to be made . makes it feel like that that run out of money , and said `` time to pack up . let 's finish it off another day ( or maybe in another decade ) . there 's no rush . '' however it did find it rather diverting , thanks largely to its quick pace , some well-executed combat and george mooradian 's gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop . performances are fair . kris kristofferson 's dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self-assured , psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression . however her acting is too wooden . a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouth-watering performance of pure ham , as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown . scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too . pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces , involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow-motion . seeping into the background is a scorching , but mechanical sounding music score . the special effects and make-up fx stand up fine enough . watchable , but not quite a success and it 's minimal limitations can be a cause of that .
feeding the masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around , mostly due to the popularity of movies such as land of the dead and the resident evil series . it starts at a television station , which is guarded by the military , and are reporting that the lazarus virus ( zombies ) are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again . the problem is , this is totally false . zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware . among them are torch ( william garberina ) , the camera man , sherry ( rachael morris ) , the lead anchor woman ( who for some reason is listed as playing shelly on this website ) and roger ( patrick cohen ) , their military escort . torch and sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service ( or some other government agency ) and they are heavily censored . this movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box-cover saying `` we hold feeding the masses on a higher level than any o the three 'of the dead ' films by george a . rombero . '' the source of that quote has lost all credibility with me . let me just say that this movie is bad . i do n't mean bad like i was expecting more ( i obviously was , though ) but i mean bad in that i could not find any redeeming qualities in the film , whatsoever . the acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden . did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards ? i ca n't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor/actress . there really was not one . if i had to give a nod to someone , i would say roger , the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much . i would have to recommend to pass on this movie , despite the box-cover looking pretty good ( it 's what originally drew me to the movie ) . 3/10
as i was watching this movie i was thinking , ok it 'll get good any moment ... i was wrong . the real best part of this movie was when it was over . a complete waste of 92 minutes . all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you could n't really even see him that good . and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well . there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down . the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo . for the creature to be so bad , you definitely could n't tell it by this movie .
now i 'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair , so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie . that about sums it up too . i disliked this movie . to be more specific , i disliked the concept of this movie . the cinematography was good . the mood was nice . and the acting was satisfactory . however , the story is fatuous , unacurate and misleading . it is also offensive . i am a quarter cree indian , and for some reason i feel insulted , on a personal level , by the nature of whitaker 's character . first of all , he 's a black guy . and this is n't a racist remark , i swear . the thought of a white , hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents . the katana represents the soul of a samurai , imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai . for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside , and where the heck did he get a katana anyway ? it must be one of those replicas , which insults the samurai caste even more . also , ghost dog showed no honor . near the end of the movie , he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain . not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy , it 's more like a ninjas way ; silent assassins ; a group that samurais deny exists , but hates none-the-less . then he tries to kill his boss , when he finds out his boss is a baddie . you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable ? he kills himself , to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master . everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to : bushido . so , we have great cinematography , good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise , ( which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it ) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film , and an insult to everything a honorable bushi ( samurai ) holds dear . 2.5/10 bleah
now i myself am a lover of the b movie genre but this piece of trash insults me to no end . first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire 's brother as the annoying little kid that goes looking for his lost 3 legged dog . now please what kind of dumb ass mistakes a three-legged dog for a god damn mutated crocodile please i ask you ? and heres another point for pondering , why do they show the dinocroc on the back of the movie box being enormous and actually in the water ? i believe if memory serves the thing spent about 2.6 minutes in the water and was just shy of 6 feet tall , that was a heart breaker . but redeeming qualities to this movie were that it was so bad that i almost died laughing because believe me the bad acting made me wish for death . but the fact remains that once again this thing is created by another military testing site to train super crocodiles for military combat or something like that from the source of all things evil e.v.i.l corporation . and let 's not forget the characters let 's see we have jerk off # 1 as the male lead and half way decent chick ( who does n't know how to act ) as the female lead to that i say wow ! the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the heroes spend about what seems like 2 hours talking and planning some long elaborate way of killing the dinocroc only to have it fail and kill it in an ordinary way that could have taken about 15 seconds to come up with . all in all this movie was beyond gay with its random opera music in the background and the fact that it was probably the gayest of all cgi monsters ever made along with the fact it of course was impervious to bullets and bombs ( otherwise it would n't have been made for the military duh ! ) . by far the best scene was when lizzy mcguire 's brother runs into the shack and the dinocroc eats him causing his head to pop clean off with a popping noise i might add . i believe that you would be better off shooting yourself between the eyes then to watch dinocroc . and as for the director i believe that we should get a bunch of people to hang him by a noose and all take turns kicking him in the crotch for wasting an hour and a half of our lives until he finally dies and then i can go on living .
-=contains spoiler from both original and movie versions=- i am a huge fan of notre dame de paris musical , i also read book this summer and i watched movie today , in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6.3 imdb point.first scenes were good but i actually waited for , theaters scene directly from book , but it was normal but when esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong .. they do n't even kiss in book , even in musical .. and there were huge gap why esmeralda being judged by sorcerer , in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word `` phoebus '' .. wait there were a phoebus were n't there ? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more , the creators made quasimodo 's love to show around and they even canceled frollo 's love .. but notre dame was frollo . his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is , some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and not mentioning phoebus , not mentioning love of frollo , not mentioning jehan ( brother of frollo ) not mentioning mother of esmeralda ( maybe it is ok , the storyline would have chopped much ) they even not mentioned the real story .. ( another ps : frollo was n't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold .. he was stuck in science and religion ) finally do n't watch this movie , it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece , and if you have watched it before read the book , god have mercy on you .. you must read to book immediately .. this movie is worse than hunchback of notre dame ii the animated movie , spend your time with watching notre dame de paris musical .. enough said ..
the screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the `` exorcist ' . but put in some blah-blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged . there is no substance whatsoever in this entire film . it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about . extremely boring , i wanted to leave the theater when i saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so i had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever . nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about . they use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me ( as it intended , i hate cgi ) just ruined the movie even more . some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how `` thought-provoking '' and `` slow-paced-without-action-because it 's an intelligent film '' it was . what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion ? seems like an uninspired concept . oh and there 's some mumbo jumbo about the `` sin-eater '' ( movie was originally going to be titled `` sin-eater '' ) . lame concept but the movie took the `` sin-eater '' thing too seriously , making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was . yeah , i know there were really sin-eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy . nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie . if you want horror films that actually have depth , watch rosemary 's baby , the tenant , naked blood , society , cannibal holocaust , pin , exorcist , omen , or any of the romero `` dead trilogy '' films . nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people , mainstream movie fans think that though ( same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece ) . if you want mind-numbingly boring horror , watch the order . this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride .
recipe for one of the worst movies of all time : a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf , has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects ( the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear ) and takes time out to pet a deer . then you got the unlikable characters , 30 year old college students , a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots , lots more . avoid at all costs .
this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile . after seeing it , my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining . this is a good example of a `` concept only '' film -- they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make $ $ just based on the initial concept . the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole . she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them -- she simply could n't hurt a flea . this does n't last too long after her release and she 's back to her old ways . period . the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters . eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him -- and that is tough considering i am a die-hard python fan . it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money ( there ca n't be any other reason ) . cruella 's low self-esteem servant , tim mcinnerny , was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny . and it must have cost a few bucks to get gérard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well . there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were , i am trying to block them out of my mind . overall , you 'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel .
i do n't know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for , but i watch them because , as silly as they are , they 're at least always good for a laugh . why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing , when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of ? attack force is by no means a great movie , but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies ; in fact i did n't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot . it had , most of the time , a half-way coherent plot line , and it was , most of the time , fundamentally exciting . the ending really sucked , but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements . in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised , but i actually thought that the acting , characterization ( if i may use such a big word ) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect . seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced , no-nonsense man 's man that we 've come to expect , and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well , without ever up-staging him . this , people , is what a steven seagal movie does . deal with it . or even better : laugh at it . 4 out of 10 .
i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film festival 's prestigious competition section . i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging quality . the film , some reviewers , have noted does not have too much of gunfire -- but the inherent violence is repulsive . imagine killing your enemy/competitor in front of your young son .. or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty . there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in copolla 's `` godfather '' that seem to resurface here in this chinese/hong kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and cheese . this film is only recommended for violence junkies .. there is no great cinema here . at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values .
dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive . cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop . we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat , big mistake ! myers proves he ca n't act in this film . he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve . the kids in this movie are all right , somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying . the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories , never tweak with the original story ! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea . he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it . the film sure does look tacky ! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word , mildly funny . at least the grinch had spunk , and the film was actually good ! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting . was mike myers even in this movie actually ? and another thing , the fish . what is with that stupid fish ! first time you see him , he 's an actual fish . next time you see him , he 's all animated and talking . but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough ! this film is a total off target wreck . good joke , bad joke , bad , bad , bad , good joke ! i 'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke , that was good . so please if you have the choice , watch the grinch instead of this mess .
i was rooting for this film as it 's a remake of a 1970s children 's tv series `` escape into night '' which , though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd , fascinating and disturbing . the acting in `` paperhouse '' is wooden , unintentionally a joke . the overdubs did n't add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch . casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth , chemistry or conviction . as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted , consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible . out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than i could have dreamt . `` escape into night '' deserves a proper remake , written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind .
so why does this show suck ? unfortunately , that really is the only question , because there is no doubt that it does . for those unfamiliar with the premise of the show , the doomed-to-be-shortlived series cavemen focuses on a number of neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day america and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for geico insurance . the concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully . i had to think about it for awhile , but then the tagline from the commercials -- something to the effect of `` we 're not that much different from you '' provided me with the key to the show 's suckiness . even though cavemen/neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity , the title characters of this show , it turns out , are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks . maybe its my background as a game writer -- rather than a soulless , hack , committee-based writer from california -- but this show had so much potential , and none of it has been realized . to start with , the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us . what could conceivably be funny , for example , about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk , when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks ? why would they play prosaic games like squash , when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears ? a show like this could write itself , and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring . another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities . yawn ! this has been done so many times before , and never more drearily than this . and , as noted previously , neanderthals really are a different species , so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark . responses are welcome , including those from anyone who wants to tell me why i 'm wrong . i 'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that i have thus far been unable to . michael j. varhola , skirmisher online gaming magazine
sorry , but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face . the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas , ... and santa does . dad is peachy , happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died . all ends syrupy sweet . but as a parent who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend , it was a horror flick . now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa ! do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart- no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas . it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh . shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently . it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child , but there are some wishes that we should n't even portray as a possibility .
ok first of all let me say that i 'm still amazed of how the plot sucks , but than again its a movie that sequels a steven segal movie only with no steven segal omg ! ! ! just random low budget action scenes really no point i 'm still amazed i burned 90 min on this crap really ! ! just rent a jacky chan movie or go see wwf more fun and has no and presume not to have and plot ! ! ! plz plz plz avoid it ! ! btw the best actor playing there is bill goldberg and that says a lot ! ! and no he does n't play very well like i said plz avoid it pfff i still cant believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this ! ! : )
after chaplin made one of his best films : dough & dynamite , he made one of his worst : gentlemen of nerve . during this first year in films , chaplin made about a third of all his films . many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing , editing , gags , location shooting , etc . this one takes place at a racetrack where chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying . mabel normand is there with her friend also , and chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and mabel 's friends . he then woos mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior . lots of slapstick in here , but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching chaplin develop . the print i saw was badly deteriorated , which may have affected its enjoyment . charley chase can be glimpsed . * of 4 stars .
watching this again recently , i found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen , even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure . by any objective measure this was a disaster , but i found it easy to imagination how good a lord of the rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely - and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers . unfortunately , thanks to jackson , that will not be possible for a long time . watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all , then this story simply could n't be stuffed up . fantasy just provides so many opportunities for making an interesting film . there were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that peter jackson did it , although of course you always have to use your imagination due to the poor execution . the way they tried to show the wraith world from frodo 's point of view for example . or the way that galadriel showed sam what was happening back home for another . another thing i really appreciated in this version - the silent moments . there were moments when dialog was spoken with no background music against a still back-drop . compare that to the grandiose swooping camera of the jackson films , and the intrusive score which seemed designed to stress how each and every scene was the most poignant and powerful scene we had ever watched . jackson 's films were full of their own importance , this was quieter and a lot more modest . jackson and co hit this with more than us $ 270 million dollars in production costs , at least $ 90 million dollars more for marketing , a massive tax break from the nz government , and also gained massive savings from filming in nz not the usa . however , despite the marketing claims , the intention to be faithful was never there . this is well documented . philippa boyens said as much in an interview , when she said they deliberately did n't re-read the books before writing the script . jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film `` along the lines of '' the lord of the rings , and that the one he really wanted to do was return of the king , because it had a lot of battles but no character development . in contrast , this film tried to be more true . of course a lot of things were wrong , the acting was awful and pretty much sunk everything , and the pace was too fast . naturally they cut a lot , and adapted other scenes , and for this they deserve credit . while jackson added a lot of action scenes that served no plot purpose , bakshi cut book scenes which did nothing to advance the plot anyway . there 's actually a curious similarity between the structure of the jackson and bakshi films near the beginning - in that they both deviate from the original books in the same way - although of course some of this could be coincidence . this was not a good film , but the potential was there . bakshi said in an interview to the onion av club that only animation could do the lord of the rings justice . his version did n't work , but he might have been right .
this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen . i remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason i thought i enjoyed it . so , like an idiot , i ran out to purchase the dvd once it was released ... what a tragic mistake ! i wo n't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow . i am a fan of herschell gordon lewis so i am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level . it is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their goal , they suceeded . if they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way , shape , or form that it is real then they failed ... miserably ! avoid this movie ... read the plot synopsis and you 've seen it !
basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war . but there were a couple things that struck me . first was the use of mouthed epithets . in two cases the scott character mouths one , once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off ( `` dammit '' ) and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot ( `` s * % t '' ) . i could be wrong about the second instance but i replayed it several times and that 's what it looks like to me . the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the o'brien character goodbye and good luck ( `` give 'em hell '' ) over the roar of the engines . she must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says `` heck '' . i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing , specifically bombing civilians . the avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used . given what we know about the lemay 's later strategy of firebombing japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony . i remember mcnamara 's quoting of lemay in `` the fog of war '' , something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal . the ending is way overwrought , in keeping with the movie . it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat ( i 'm not comparing the films , just the ending ! ) . maybe it 's just 'cause he gets blowed up . blowed up real good ! ! !
in the u.s. , very few films have been made about rome that were not set in the time of julius caesar or shortly thereafter . hollywood 's sword and sandal epics mostly have a christian theme , which makes it difficult to get into earlier roman history ( spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule , and encountered some resistance in hollywood because it did not have jesus in it ) . it 's interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of caesar and christ , but is set when rome was only one city among many on the italian peninsula , and had just ousted the hated king tarquin and formed the republic . however , this is not a historical film ; it 's peplum , and while the production values are n't rock bottom , the acting and characterizations are cardboard . i can only imagine what the dialogue was like in italian , but with wooden english dubbing it 's very campy . i got a few good laughs out of it at first . i have n't seen many films of this genre , having missed most of the hercules movies of the 60s . it 's amusing up to a point , but as the film goes on , it gets somewhat boring . one thing 's for sure : if i 'd seen this movie when i was ten years old , i would have loved it . at that age , i went for anything with romans and swordfights in it . so at least , this flick brought back some childhood memories .
this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i 've ever viewed . if they want to make a movie with a lousy story , they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book . there is hardly a relation between wolfe 's book and this movie other than the title . i do n't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen . at least the changes should n't hurt the final product . the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing . the actors are miscast . the director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon . if you 've seen this movie and disliked it , try the book . if you 've seen this movie and liked it , read the book .
the movie is steeped in religion , so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it . in my opinion , this movie pretends to explore deep issues , but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices ; with little true insight . what the people in the movie ( and therefore , the writer ) failed to see was grace . they failed to understand that god is the author of beauty and he is the creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds . to imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful , and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty , is just an oversimplification . such stereotypes really do n't exist , for even jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife 's pleasure before his own . scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh , and that no man ever hated his own flesh , but he nourishes and cherishes it . even if you want to ignore the new testament , the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the song of solomon in the old testament , and the even the book of proverbs which says , `` rejoice in the wife of thy youth , let her breasts satisfy you always '' ! how can that be read in any way other way than that god knows , and approves of , and smiles on , the marital union and the enjoyment thereof ? real men do n't ignore the value and needs of their wives . those that do deny a very basic teaching of the judeo/christian religion . god never said those things . it 's absurd . sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true god of abraham . it did n't need to be so . how sad . what sonia desperately needed was truth , not tradition . in knowing , loving and obeying god , we love others more ; before ourselves . that is the faith of the god of abraham , isaac , jacob & joseph ; once for all delivered to the saints ; bought & paid for by jesus christ , the righteous . but alright , ignore all this and abandon ancient , holy scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts . that 's a good plan . i would never recommend this movie ; partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic , but also because it really does n't offer any valuable insight . check out `` yentl '' if you want to see a much more useful treatment of jewish tradition at odds with society .
bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachan 's mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated . manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaag , parvarish , amar akbar anthony , naseeb , desh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed . my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part 2 , maybe mr desai ran out of ideas , after all he had been using that formula for years and years . 1 . first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa , for instance the police inspector who brings up amar , the muslim who brings up akbar , nirupa roy and a few more . 2 . in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight , in mard she loses her voice 3 . in aaa there is the famous song ( shirdi wale sai baba ) well in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali . having seen aaa for over 1000 times i noticed that straight away . my other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous , true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far . my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing . i know it has many fans that swear by it but i did n't like it one bit . it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child .
updating of the bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad-to-average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema-going set . ( for the record , this list , all of the films on which appear to be attempting a castle-esque miracle , includes , strange bedfellows , thunderstruck , bad eggs , the honourable wally norman , horseplay , the wannabes and the nugget . the only one to have worked has been crackerjack . ) here , the performances never mesh , as john howard does n't even look like he 's in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention , as franklin plays sleepy , conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants . 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on-screen , but this is hardly a reason to watch the film . in fact , the only reasons may well be ( 1 ) howard 's bizarre  but quite fun  performance , and ( 2 ) the 'suburban nightmare ' theme , which has run through somersault , strange bedfellows , tom white , alexandra 's project , danny deckchair , the rage in placid lake , traveling light , teesh & trude , swimming upstream and lantana , many of which are very good/excellent . enter at own risk ! may be one for people who titter at the word 'penis ' . 4/10 .
this movie was not made by who fans . most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over : in christmas , they did n't show daltry 's screams after the line `` tommy does n't know what day it is ... '' , they showed almost * no * townsend guitar shots in pinball wizard , there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of go to the mirror , and worst of all , in the second half of we 're not gon na take it ( listening to you ) , they robbed us of almost every shot of pete 's blazing guitar chords . huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band . it 's a very frustrating film to watch , and does n't deliver the goods . i do n't know if director murry lerner is just not a who fan , or worse , for him at least , if he * is * a who fan and this is all the * eight * cameras could deliver for him . to its credit , there are some rare numbers before tommy , as well as some faves , that are very well shot , and sometimes the editing is brilliant . this might be enough to make some viewers happy , as long as you 're not anticipating tommy . the sound overall was mediocre in the transmission i watched from directv ; it may be different on video or dvd .
pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind . the film , one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity . vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people . while black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world , pyare mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests . anu malik 's music is fair enough . vivek oberoi who made a promising start with saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema . fardeen khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry . amrita rao and esha deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados . boman irani , as the villainous don toni , is somewhat acceptable . avoid the film if possible .
i 'm not particularly fond of remakes , or to steal the modern jargon `` retellings '' , but this film truly peeved me off . the original prom night , while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece , still realized what it was ... horror . there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film . suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience . sorry folks , but a white knuckle film this was not ! the scares were cheap , and foreshadowed terribly . ( a good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now , is the cat jumping out of the closet , followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film ) this film could n't successfully pull that off , so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film . there needs to be a likable hero or heroine . this film does n't have one . the person i most identified with was the head detective . his calm demeanor , but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have . common sense approach to events that occur . ( if you 're running from an axe wielding psycho , you turn and sprint in the opposite direction . not jog , whilst looking back ever three seconds , gaging the killer 's progress , only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path . ) if you friend disappears , you do n't go looking for them alone . and if you suspect foul play you tell someone , not investigate yourself . these clichés are tired and well overplayed . in the horror genre in general , and in this film in particular .
much of `` over her dead body '' is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors . eva longoria proves that she ca n't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy , and further , that she does n't really even have any comedic timing . she 's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé . the fiancé is played by paul rudd , drippy and charmless , while the psychic is played by lake bell , bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has . i felt most sorry for bell , as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work . unfortunately , she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable , and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of `` titanic . '' `` over her dead body '' actually pi * * ed me off , because of its laziness and utter lack of effort . i started to think of all the interesting projects that ca n't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this . seriously , does hollywood think movies like this are good enough ? how stupid do they really think the movie-going public is ? grade : f
please make me forget . please . please . this is the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to watch . i consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film . i have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences . what a load of garbage ! ! and do n't get me started about the acting ... someone please help me forget ! ! `` weird science '' -- come back ! ! everything is forgiven ... i am `` proud '' to give this film the first 1 here at imdb ... and i 've voted for hundreds of films ... many of them c * * p but this is so bad i ca n't even believe it . someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film ? someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film ? someone read the script and auditioned for it ? someone saw the film and decided * not * to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity ? * these * are the questions i want answers to . not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well , you know ...
the plot it 's not so original . if someone saw `` l'ultimo bacio '' there 's nothing new . a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that 's is boring and false , with everyone asking to others what they think about them . really boring after an half of hour because it 's simple to understand where the story is going to finish . this because it 's simple to see the moralistic view of muccino in this movie , so even the hardest parts seem normal . to summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said . the family saw from a 30 years old , i do n't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations . really good how muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it 's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining . perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it . morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie !
the film-school intellects can drool all they want about the important ( imagined ) meaning of this film , but it 's just that : intellectual drool . this film is creatively bankrupt , and some mistake it 's endless self-indulgent wanking as substance . yeah . obviously godard was n't a stones fan . too bad , because this could have been great . he 's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap . then there 's the endless shots of what looks like 60 's librarians spray-painting words on people 's cars . and then there 's the seemingly neverending `` interview '' where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions . there 's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book , which goes on for , oh , only about 20 minutes . and black panthers or something in a junkyard . it almost sounds intriguing ? well , it 's not . but for unwashed film-school hipsters who do n't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag 's , this film 's a real winner ! more accurately ... maybe godard just blows .
i 'm gettin ' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you 'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap . who knows : `` witchery '' may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios , even with a `` big name cast '' ( like blair and hasselhoff - wink-wink , nudge-nudge ) and the effervescent likes of hildegard knef ( i dunno , some woman ... ) . but on film , it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm . seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the eastern seaboard , and one of them ( a woman , i 'd guess ) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque , tortuous ways . okay , right there you have a cross-section of plots from `` the exorcist '' , `` the omen '' , `` ten little indians '' and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line . none of it is very entertaining and for the most part , you 'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it 's over . no , not even linda blair and david hasselhoff help matters much . they 're just in it to pick up a paycheck and do n't seem very intent on giving it their `` all '' . from the looks of it , hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with pam anderson ( and who can blame him ? ) and linda ... well , who knows ; a celebrity peta benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she 's in to nowadays . and the torture scenes ! ecchhhh . you 'll see people get their mouths sewn shut , dangled up inside roaring fireplaces , strung up in trees during a violent storm , vessels bursting out of their necks , etc , etc . sheesh , and i thought `` mark of the devil '' was the most sadistic movie i 'd seen .... do n't bother . it 's not worth your time . i ca n't believe i told you as much as i did . if you do watch it , just see if you can count the cliches . and yes , blair gets possessed , as if you did n't see that coming down main street followed by a marching band . no stars . `` witchery '' - these witches will give you itches .
if , in the first 10 minutes of this film , you do n't realize that the main character , who writes a life advice column , is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself , then there is probably something wrong with you . the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie , even if the rest of the movie was good ( which it is n't ) there 's almost no chemistry between the leads , and steve carell 's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing , not funny . it 's hard to believe binoche 's character would have any interest in him . then in the end it 's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after . is n't that great america !
difficult to call the grudge a horror movie . at best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments . if one forgets the ( failed ) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie , he is again disappointed . the acting is ok but not great . the story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning , while one is trying to get what 's happening . but toward the end one understands there is not much to understand . `` scary '' elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason ... so ... ( yawn ) see this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do , like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .
i rented this movie , thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece . what i got was a piece of pure garbage . this movie was confusing in most spots , choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots . mira sorvino 's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best . ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects . fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley ; at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie . the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably . almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect ; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i 've ever seen . jay rodan was almost good as agis ; too bad he had such a bad script to work with . rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting . in the end , i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds . i 'm so glad i did n't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater . if they 've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century , it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work . if i had been there , they would n't have hear the play over the snoring . thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players ; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes . guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end !
this was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly is n't that great . sure , `` chaos '' and `` inside man '' are literally the same movie , just with variations in suspense . but i found `` chaos '' more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film `` swordfish . '' the reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the states and `` chaos '' was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters , but has yet to find a distributor in the u.k. and u.s.a . it 's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like dog day afternoon and other spike lee films , but that does n't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch . watch it if nothing else is on t.v. , but you 'll probably get bored with after awhile .
i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film , but this is too much . in the end they look like a bunch of loonies . this film is one of those finding yourself 70 's plots , i know the film is made in 1980 . a lot more of clint and girl friend movie . this movie is a 3/10 .
i would have given it a one instead of a two , but i suppose it could have been worse . i guess the acting is n't all that bad , but the plot lacks anything even remotely close to interesting . it is a terrible movie ! ! terrible ! complete waste of time ! i strongly suggest you do not watch this movie. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
okay so i found out about this movie and i watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether i should watch it or not . before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it . i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time . so i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought : the beginning started off fine for me . it seemed to be heading in a decent direction . got past the rape scene and i could n't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie . do n't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it did n't really bother me to a dramatic point . then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on . there was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing ! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie did n't have that . it had about 3 of these pointless scenes , where you see the main character maya kind of get out of control but it did n't show it right making me want to fast forward . then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it was n't so boring but still a little dull . oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job . okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to maya 's attention . thats where it got disturbing . i did n't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it . i cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so ... i do n't know i cant find a word to sum it up . but if you choose to watch it just do n't be unsuprised .
i could n't believe that this movie dates from 2007 , it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick . did n't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi ? ! ? did n't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic ? or did i get the purpose wrong , was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal , bound together in the big cycle of life , or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature , or something like that ? ? it does n't really matter , either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts . first of all : the premise is very improbable . if at a given time you 're capable of replacing a total eye , no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time , that 's totally unprofessional . and to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient ? ! and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans , and make the victim look like a freak ? ! by the way , i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes , could n't they have waited for such a specimen ? the story is lame , it 's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants , which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf ( or at least , that 's what i make of it ) and then he 's being chased by some military men . especially this last bit is ridiculous . i mean , i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment ( imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight ! ) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient , it 's beyond me why they 're out to kill him . why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient ? ( a volunteering soldier maybe ? ? ) . and why try to kill everyone else that 's involved with poor aaron , is n't that a bit steep ? ! who the hell are these militaries anyway , i hope not the us army or the government , they behave like psychopaths , walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons , raiding private apartments like they 're after some public enemy # 1 , and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline , like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren , panicking and shooting randomly around . aaron , for some unfathomable medical reason , feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes . why would that be ? ? ? he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves . what is this ? are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it 's eye-balls ? ! ? and that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf 's craving for red ( life- ) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat ( can a wolf even do that ? ? ! ) . the acting ( or the lack thereof ) did n't help the credibility of all this either : everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls , especially this indian girl , she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression ( vexed ) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of nature , and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her ( but hey , there probably had to be at least one love-scene ! ) . i really sympathized with actor cory monteith , who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face , but they did n't give him much to go with . he has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie , which could have been fun to watch , but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique , monteith really should leave his shirt on . his ( few ) killings and attacks are hardly shown , we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there 's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest . not much for a modern sci-fi horror ! the only good acting came from justine bateman , and i really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady . she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions , but they made her character a kind of a wimp , who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries . what a pity that the script did n't make her stand up a bit more ! in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie , hardly scary or thrilling , with unbelievable goings-on , a lot of overlong national geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes ( who cares ? ! ? ) , some pretentious indian ramblings about man and nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments . i guess the word `` superfluous '' covers it all .
live feed is set in some unnamed chinese/japanese asian district somewhere as five american friends , sarah ( ashley schappert ) , emily ( taayla markell ) , linda ( caroline chojnacki ) , mike ( lee tichon ) & darren ( rob scattergood ) are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights . after a scuffle in a bar with a japanese triad boss ( stephen chang ) they decide to check out a porno theatre , as you would . inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which are n't made clear . can local boy miles ( kevan ohtsji ) save them ? this canadian production was co-written , produced & directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well , one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of hostel ( 2005 ) & the mini craze for 'torture porn ' as it 's become known . according the imdb 's 'trivia ' section for live feed writer & director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres , for my money i reckon he wrote it after watching hostel ! the script is pretty poor , there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people , none . was it for the triads ? was it for his pleasure ? was it to make snuff films to sell ? some sort of explanation would have been nice . also why did he turn on the triad boss at the end ? if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed . it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex , s & m , horror , torture , gore & action films which does n't come off . i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre is n't automatically going to make your film any good , there still needs to be a decent script & story , right ? the character 's were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable . it moves along at a reasonable pace , it 's fairly sleazy mixing gore , sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect . director nicholson does n't do anything special here , the editing is choppy & annoying , he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it . available in both ' r ' & 'unrated ' versions i saw the shorter cut ' r ' version which really is n't that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the 'unrated ' version & say that it might be much , much gorier but i ca n't say for sure . there 's a fair amount of nudity too if that 's your thing . i would n't say there 's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there is n't & are n't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i suppose . technically live feed is n't terribly impressive , the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening , it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the ' r ' rated version is at times an annoying mess . shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in vancouver in canada . the acting is poor , sometimes i could n't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing ... live feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent , i did n't think much of it with it 's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere , poor acting & less than impressive gore ( at least in the ' r ' rated cut anyway ) . watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior .
wow . what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel . here are just a few gripes . - the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book . - plot has been grotesquely altered . - voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages ( which may read well but are not the same when spoken , especially with chabon 's writing style ) . - the acting is more wooden than a log cabin . ( esp . bechstein ) - this is supposed to be set in 1983 ? ? ? feels more like 2003 ... to be fair i could n't bring myself to finish watching this movie , so it 's possible that it redeemed itself ... ( sarcasm ) . i truly hope that no one paid to see this , or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent ( a la wonder boys ) . i like chabon as a writer but he should be ashamed of this adaptation . no stars .
yet again one of the most misunderstood goddesses of my country has been twisted by `` westerners '' who can not understand the esoteric symbolism of the mother goddess in her dark forms . the mother takes on the frightening form of kali mata to destroy our inner demons , and to terrify our egos . and though blood sacrifice is given to kali and durga , the events depicted in this film are just absurd . the mother takes on a wrathful form to be wrathful to our inner demons , limitations , and ego when no other form will suffice . it 's also in her wrathful form that she burns away all your karmas in the `` smashan '' fires that you cultivate in your heart for her to dance on if you love her , and she will bring you to reality and truth . reality and truth has a dark side as well as light , which serves a purpose . the mother is the embodiment of the physical universe as well , she is nature . nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance . you can not have growth and life without death and destruction . kali represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe . it 's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of india or it 's divinity can just take one of our beloved goddesses and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low-budget , talentless horror film . how dare they take our beloved mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their eyelids off ! ? she is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in delusion , greed , anger , and other inner-demons . it 's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self-deluding ego , and serious inner-demons to see kali as so horrible and terrible . when the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting , beautiful , and young , a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she enchants the entire universe with it . kali maa is an ancient mother , not to be trifled with for the sake of entertainment , let 's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on wrathful form to those involved with this movie . the audacity that westerners have in using religions like my own , or the religions of the caribbean islands such as santeria , and vodou which are actually very positive , and other such religions to twist and exaggerate misunderstood elements that the western mind can not comprehend , is totally ridiculous . it 's clear that there is no respect for what people live , breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks . kali maa in reality is a caring and compassionate mother , whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for . and i am happy that my mother takes on wrathful form sometimes to protect her devotees from themselves and from outside forces . many praises to the real kali maa , who has shown many the path of god and realization .
to be as honest as i possibly can , the devil 's plaything ( or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or ) is a complete bore . the movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible . there are great , long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens . characters just stand around with nothing to do . there 's no mystery , no suspense , and no plot points to care about . the acting is simply abysmal . most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera . they do this repeatedly . and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing . while it 's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead , it comes close .
first of all , if you ' r a fan of the comic , well , you 'll be very disappointed i 'm sure ! low budget movie ! ! ! largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic , now suddenly he becomes croatian , pfff ! chicken producers , it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( by the way , in the film , his father speaks serbian and he speaks croatian ... lol ) . the striking n.y. winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in h.k . the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan/turkish looking guy . freddy the cool 'scarface ' pilot becomes some fat , out of shape , sad , average guy . simon , largo 's good buddy , does not exist at all ! ? he gave some pepper ! largo does n't throw knifes at all , but just some snake stares ... the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv-film . french directors and producers , if you do n't have the money , the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic , please stick to some romance shooted in paris . very very bad film , good thing i just rented it , do n't count on me to watch the sequel ( if there is any ! ) .
this movie is horrible ! it rivals `` ishtar '' in the number of embarrassingly bad moments . i would have rated it lower than a 3 , save for a couple of funny lines ; but , overall , this film was crap ! it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere . joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever !
filmed in a documentary style , but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached . a recently divorced wannabe film maker ( myles berkowitz ) sees a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time . he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications . the comedy is spotty at best ; the rest is mishap after mishap . also taking part are richard arlook , robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner . trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo . this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date .
this film concerns the story of eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . the plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . but this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . screenplays not always need be 'chatty ' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . here one line attempts such as `` he just took off '' or `` i know you do n't have love in heart '' just do fully evoke something worth the audience 's time . also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . talk about trying to hard . if you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .
yeah i saw the rough cuts . the unedited sex scenes . the dire cut scenes . almost on a par with the film 'the need ' for awful acting . this movie is as bad as bad films get.the bad script , bad acting , bad effects , bad locations , bad stunts bad everything . the best 'actors ' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras ! sean harry , the 'foppish actor ' as someone else put it , makes a matchstick look talented here . his amazing ability to badly drive a car , when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet ( check out the reflection in the windscreen ) , his inability to turn left , which is class . oh and do n't forget the sex scene . plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys could n't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun . the other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines.it was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that was n't there ! the 'special effects ' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits ! if you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie ... then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and do n't give money to people who do n't deserve it .
i 'm a huge steven seagal fan . hell , i probably weigh as much as he does although i do n't have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail . having stated my own bias and affection for america 's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero , it is with a heavy heart that i must declare this to be his worst movie ever . i 'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this . in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post-production . it 's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline . that results in woeful voiceovers in which steve 's voice does n't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice . the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad , gets even worse , and by the end you 'll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead . yes , it 's that bad . after this i do n't know what to expect from steve . my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds . is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs ? if you are tempted to watch this movie , rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet . a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this .
what the * bliep * is it with this movie ? could n't they fiend a better script ? all in all a 'nice ' movie , but ... it has been done more than once ... up till the end i thought it was okay , but ... the going back to the past part ... * barf * so corny ... was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear ... but wow , that did n't happen ... which is good . i loved big with tom hanks , but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he/she is older/bigger ; that just is so pasé just watch till it comes out on tv . do n't get me wrong , but it ai n't all that
believe it or not , this movie is worse than number three.it 's slower , the acting is worse , and the story is very weak.there is n't a lot of good to say about this movie.even the fight scenes are more dull than number three , and i would have thought that impossible.this is a very slow 90 minutes.painful , in fact.i stuck it through , hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie , you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find ( for purchase , that is ) and probably for good reason.like number three , this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same in name only.anyway , the most i can give best of the best : without warning is 2/10
i rented this film just to see amber benson , though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good story ..... however the first problem was that there really was n't a story ... or actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense . the second problem was there was no set up for these characters ... yes i got that they all went to school together , but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and did n't like each other ... so why did they keep getting together . flaw number 3 ... the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense ( especially with the typical suspense music dubbed in ) ... he was sadly mistaken . it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time trying to bring this back to life .... my only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film .
ok , i kinda like the idea of this movie . i 'm in the age demographic , and i kinda identify with some of the stories . even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic , and in a different movie would have been forgivable . i 'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did , but it 's not that easy when the filmmakers were n't trying at all . the editing in this movie is terrible ! possibly the worst editing i 've ever seen in a movie ! there are things that you do n't have to go to film school to learn , leaning good editing is not one of them , but identifying a bad one is . also , the shot ... oh my god the shots , just awful ! i ca n't even go into the details , but we sometimes just see random things popping up , and that , in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience . this movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also . i 've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity ! joe , greta , i do n't know what the heck you were thinking , but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos . you should be ashamed of yourselves ! in conclusion , this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene . if that 's not your kind of thing , avoid this at all cost !
i really did n't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv , which is were i live , acting in it . this town is dull and so is this film . there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there was n't any . unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday , then stay away from this movie . the dialog will put you to sleep , the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . its a predictable movie with no surprises . what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator .
the first 30min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on ( unless you read the book - which i had not ) . if you can stick with the first half , the second half is sweet - predictable , yes , but sweet none-the-less . the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early 80 's , not 2005 . no stand-out moments , bland , but it moved along without boring me . i would like to know why keaton selected this role , her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance .
the end of violence and certainly the million dollar hotel hinted at the idea the wenders has lost his vision , his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture . the land of plenty seals the coffin , i 'm afraid , by being a vastly unimaginative , obviously sentimental and cliché 'd film . the characters are entirely flat and stereotyped , the writing , plot and direction are amateurish , at best . for the first time in quite a while , i was impatient for the film to end so i could get on with my life . the war-torn delirium of the uncle , the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion ... it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic , hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen . what happened ? the days of experimentation , perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him , i 'm afraid . let 's hope he finds his inspiration again ... at the toronto film festival , which is where i saw the film , wenders was there to introduce it . completely lacking in humility , he offered us the following : `` i hope ... no , wait ... i know you 're going to enjoy the next two hours . '' i 'm afraid he could n't be more wrong ...
this was a new alltime low among westerns . the writing is excruciatingly bad , characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland , the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed . and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent , sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism . 'ride with the devil ' is among my five worst movie experiences ever , a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect .
for the first time in years , i 've felt the need to log into imdb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review , because it was just such a let-down to watch . the plot sounded awesome when i read it , i expected a minimal mystery thriller , a claustrophobic phantom hunt . unfortunately , it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane , tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth-gnashingly stupid `` no-one-says-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movies '' -dialogs that it 's just agonizing . here 's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film : - the script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it 's just laughable . no , actually , it 's angering . and lazy . - related to that : cheap thrills . a long parade `` just in time '' moments . - the main characters . alright , it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life , but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies . thus , his characters are boring , lifeless second generation clichés . they are mere plot-devices , place-holders without the slightest bit of personality . they are `` man and woman in break-up who still love each other '' . never seen that one before except in 100,000 movies and it 's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable . think of the blandest two-dimensional hollywood fare and you 've got it . there is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh , charming , or interesting . - the far-fetched , vague resolution that 's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple , though the word `` resolution '' might be ill-fitting here , because the movie is a swampy mess that is n't going anywhere anyway . by the time you 're through , though , you do n't care anymore . the last third of the movie i just fast-forwarded , because it was just so unbearable to watch . okay , that 's it . whatever redeeming features this movie has , it all gets buried under incompetence . do n't watch this turd .
the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time . when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr. wellington . a young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor . in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times : `` chris rock is supposed to be an old white guy '' . the whole concept does not play as intended : the `` illusion '' is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all . the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy , because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes , is to much of a challenge for the viewers `` suspension of disbelief '' .
this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description . but to me it was a bit of a let down . very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening . it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed ( definitely not in sequential order ) . also , nothing of any consequence was being filmed . i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer 's part , which is different from the typical hollywood film . but this one befuddled me to no end . i viewed the film a second and third time and it still did n't do anything for me . i still do n't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey . if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person 's life , i guess he succeeded . but i was looking for more . needless to say , i ca n't recommend this movie to anyone .
its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher ' movies . they are so unbelievably formulaic . and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier , i 'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that 's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams , i know what you did last summers , and urban legends . valentine offers nothing new to this genre , except a better than usual ending which , of course , leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel . as always , a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women , killing the main character 's friends , one by one , in typically over the top style . lots of t & a on display , no character development , bad acting , and overly elaborate bloodshed . the thing i ca n't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its ? ' . the thing is that they are n't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked , and tells the main character who 's friends have now all been murdered . usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway ( eg . main character 's mother 's uncle 's fishing partner kicked his friend 's father 's dog ) . everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect ' , but they are more 'red herrings ' than suspects . as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed . valentine followed this formula almost to the letter . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * spoiler ! ! ! ! ! ! ( mini spoiler anyway ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in valentine the motive was not revealed , but more , left for you to think about given that the film did n't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash ' way . the issue is only part resolved , and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody . will the killer want more , or were the demons truly vanquished ? this still did n't make valentine a good film , instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual , which still does n't count for much . to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines , please do n't . originality is so important , and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre .
utterly pretentious nonsense . the material is dull , dull , dull , and most of the cast would n't even have made understudies in allen 's earlier films . and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate ( though mysteriously popular ) ferrell even more . it appears that the morose 70-year old allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century . i truly tried to get involved in the film , but it was just impossible ; my snyapses could n't fire that slowly . so , rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position i got up , left my wife and daughter in the theater , and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re-read ( george bailey 's great tome of 30 years ago , `` germans . '' ) the day turned out pretty well after all , no thanks to woody .
it 's the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others ' success . here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier 'dracula ' ( 1931 ) and 'frankenstein ' ( 1931 ) -- in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires ( in the shape of bats ) have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims . even though shot at universal ( and at the bronson caves ! ) it 's a poverty row feature ; it 's not fair to compare it with those earlier , more expensively made and superior films . from the familiar and exciting , chilling music of the main titles ( which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff ) , through the talky but well done opening sequence , we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill , fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film . unfortunately , it does n't happen . that 's the disappointment . we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing , low budget , not enough of dwight frye , the overdone presence of maude eburne ( aunt gussie ) , and the premise for lionel atwill ( dr. von niemann ) to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil ( robert frazier ) never made very clear . do not watch the technicolor 'dr . x ' ( 1932 ) -- which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter -- before watching this the way i did ; it 's an oscar winner by comparison . so watch this one first . structurally , 'the vampire bat ' still is n't that good . it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief , without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy . besides 'dr . x ' and 'mystery of the wax museum ' ( both 1932 and co starring fay wray ) , lionel atwill 's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in 'son of frankenstein ' ( 1939 ) and as moriarity in 'sherlock holmes and the secret weapon ' ( 1943 ) . dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in 'dracula ' ( 1931 ) . as the 'young lovers , ' melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene , but that 's about it . he can be seen in 'the old dark house ' ( 1932 ) , and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in 'the most dangerous game ' ( 1930 ) . then there 's her 1933 classic 'screamer . ' too bad more time , money and rewrites were n't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill , fay wray and dwight frye . sadly , then , this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 .
deniro is a master ... one of my favourites . and i love good sports movies { not into baseball so much , but hey , its sports movies , right ? . i was expecting much more for this movie . it seems to start out well : deniro is what i expected , snipes { whom i do n't really like } is very good as the spoiled star . barkin 's role , to me , was ok. she 's a good actress , but seemed out of place in this role . to me , they always seemed to rush the scenes , and then it drags a bit in places . it just seemed tio me to be so uneven ! considering the cast and the plot , it could have been so much better . i rated it a ' 4 ' , and i was being generous ~ i 'm a tough one with numbers !
wow what can i say . i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick , but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance .lorenzo lamas , pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control . it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse . crazed hillbilles yep ! needless tit shot ( with a real weird scar ) yep ! crappy soundtrack yep ! i wish i could give the movie -10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes . seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real ...... the worse thing there is 2more snake eater movies ! ...... guess its in demand .
i 'm sorry to say that there is n't really any way , in my opinion , that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo . the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great . the s7 has a power : weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp . the s7s low end is much better too . sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much better . as for other parts of this film , i just have to say it 's so substandard as to be pathetic . the story is way too weak . the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps . i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem . this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about . its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too . i ca n't give the film a `` 1 star '' rating because it did n't compel me to actually walk out of the theater . i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal .... although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'variety ' . ps : the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek .
as i said , the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert had n't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll . what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway ? it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in . every time she opened her mouth i cringed . it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie . brad johnson was good as the other lead . i really liked the beach location scenes . they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal . i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though . it looked like the night scenes were actually sf , but i could be wrong . i do n't recall the character in the book being this depressing . please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent !
i have watched some pretty poor films in the past , but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie . had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it , because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it . i am a fan of most genres and enjoy `` shoot 'em up '' games , but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable . as most have already said , there was hardly any script and the acting was weak . i wo n't waste my time describing it . anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or sega , or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment . i must say , i was more annoyed with the video shop , who gave this a thumbs up , which led me to rent it . thank god i had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies . comic book guy would be right if he said `` worst movie ever '' !
if ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it 's this pile of crap . i love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity . i actually began to feel angry watching this film because it 's so insultingly poor , i ca n't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable . there 's no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking . the people do n't react , act or in any way resemble human beings . the entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be . the whole thing is one pointless mess , it does n't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and do n't do very much . i could make a better film than this , so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before . it 's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time . honestly , the very worst movie of all time . you 'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to buy the dvd . i ca n't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film , it 's terrible . 0/10 and that 's generous .
i suppose if you like pure action ... you 'll find it here . i suppose if you find a gorgeous blonde designed to be screwed ... find it here . i suppose if you want to find a couple of extra baddies , headed by 1-2 extra , extra baddy bosses who meat a nasty end ... you 'll find it here . overall , routine stuff , and the good guys come out on top big time under extra-ordinary circumstances . what i marvel most at ... how the good guys armed only with pistols , can kill dozens of bad guys with machine guns who are shooting at them at point blank range ... and missing . the goodies even get time to reload their pistols amid the hail of machine guns bullets . ho-hum ! ! !
van damme . what else can i say ? bill goldberg . there we go . now we know this movie is going to be really horrible . i saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs , knowing it would be bad . but not even i thought it would be this bad . the plot is awful , van damme is getting old ( finally ) , but unlike arnold , his movies are as well . forget this movie . do n't see it . ever . i would n't even be paid to see this film . 1/5 stars - at its heart lies a wonderful , action-packed thrill ride . well , maybe not , but the marketers would sure like us to think so , would n't they ? john ulmer
i tried to watch this movie three separate times . the night i rented it . got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if i had a night 's rest . watched 15 more the next day , almost vomited at how stupid it was ... it was n't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s ( if you know what i mean in the censored world we live in ) . and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i did n't enjoy one single moment ! not even one . how did this script get greenlighted . oh boy ! g 1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork .
there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner . unzip your trousers . peek inside . is there evidence of a y chromosome ? okay , you 'll do . this film has all the male requisites : blood , guns , car chases , fond women , death , multiple tattoos , cigarettes , liquor , violence , pyrotechnics -- what have i left out ? -- oh , yeah , blowtorches . as a woman , i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a ` when i was a child ... ' kind of effort . since he both wrote and directed the thing , he 's nearly solely responsible . an uneven cast ( viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job 's supposed to be done ) tries to save penn . too late . the lines and action are there . even devoted , skilled acting ca n't change those . i found this movie puerile and silly , as well as predictable . the dialogue staggers along -- sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity . then she dies . after a bit , so does the protagonists ' father , played by charles bronson . their absence is hardly noticeable . at intervals , the pyrotechnics , etc. , noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring . if you 're male and under 25 , you may adore this film . plan to return to it at 35 . think you 'll still like it ? i do n't think so .
i was expecting a very funny movie . instead , i got a movie with a few funny jokes , and many that just did n't work . i did n't like the idea of bringing in sherlock holmes ' and moriarty 's descendants . it was confusing . it would have been more funny if they just had someone new , instead of moriarty resurrected . some of the things were funny . burt kwouk was very funny , as always . mccloud on the horse was funny . the mcgarrett from hawaii 5-0 was not even mcgarrett-like . connie booth obviously is very good with accents . she is from indiana , but played english and a new yorker pretty well . unfortunately , she was not presented much into the script . i was expecting a more funny film . instead , i got a rather confusing movie with a poor script . rather ironic , since both booth and cleese were together on this one . maybe they were about to break up in 77 .
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery . it fails badly at both . the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie . the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it . could there be two movies with the same name ? the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that was n't there .
i usually do n't comment anything ( i read the others opinions ) ... but this , this one i _have_ to comment ... i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action , f-117 and other hi-tech stuff , but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind ... lousy acting , lousy script and a big science fiction . it 's one of the worst movies i have ever seen ... simply ... do n't bother ... and one more thing , before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site ... 3.7 points and i give this movie a try , now i 'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
jean-marc barr ( being light , the big blue , dogville ) has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy . i might be wrong but i do n't think this movie 's part of the dogma '95 manifesto , though it really looks like it . i 'm not really sure of what i think about this film . all actors are good . they deliver pretty good performances , especially rosanna arquette and jean-marc barr . the story is somehow interesting . but i do n't know , there 's something about the movie that i do n't like . the sex scenes are way too long . it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i do n't know exactly where it stands . sure it 's not a bad movie , but i wo n't suggest people to see it neither i 'll tell them not to watch . just do as you want . if you feel curious and you 're open-minded , give it a try , you might like it .
this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous . i wanted to watch `` darkness falls '' actually and thought that this was the movie . boy , what a mistake ! i fast-forwarded as much as i could and still i could n't get rid of the boring moments . i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie . they were actually given money for this crap . is n't that amazing ? i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood-grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee . please ! come on ! who gives money for such crap movies ? oh , and the `` tooth-fairy '' was lame . not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make-up .
i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005 . the premise was very simple and appealing : each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous , noteworthy horror director . then , when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown . some good episodes emerged from that first season , but all in all it was a mixed bag . i attributed it to the learning curve , and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better . boy , was i in for a shock . at least season one had a few good stories here and there . season 2 ( with the exception of `` the black cat '' starring the excellent jeffrey combs ) was a complete and total loss to me . the episode `` sounds like '' may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years , and most of the other episodes are n't much better . i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year , but i 'm not holding my breath .
steve carpenter can not make horror movies . first of all , the casting was very wrong for this movie . the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire slayer . this movies has no gore ( usually a key ingredient to a horror movie ) , no action , no acting , and no suspense ( also a key ingredient ) . wes bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it 's sad . there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny ( continuing the teen horror/comedy movies ) and no one laughed in the audience . i thought that this movie was rated r , and i did n't pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg-13 . anyway , see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer . that 's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary . and seriously , this is to you steve carpenter , stop making horror movies . this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre .
amelia and michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other . amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and michael hires a prostitute that does n't satisfy him . the two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end . there 's not a whole lot to this particular short . the direction is straight-forward and dramatic , which is good , the acting is sincere , but the story leaves a little bit to be desired . why , exactly , do we care about these two people ? it 's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it 's much more pared down and does n't search for meaning in it ( a welcoming change of pace if anything ) . i do n't know , it 's possible i do n't connect to these stories because i 've never experienced them . but i have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same , i.e. , a couple talking together while avoiding eye-contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines , etc . the nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different , and i 'd like to see a different take . -- polarisdib
i 've tried to watch this so-called comedy , but it 's very hard to bear . this is a bad , narrow-minded , cliché-ridden movie . definitively not funny , but very much boring and annoying , indeed . bad script , bad acting . it 's a complete waste of time - and there remains nothing more to say , i 'm afraid . 1 out of 10 points .
i was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see steve 's video . it was quite an experience ... in propaganda film-making and boredom . i was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael moore 's visit to my local school , uvsc , but it turned out to be another liberal , slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community . it sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues . what 's more surprising is to see all the '10 ' votes his homeys have posted here . did they even see the video ? golly gee batman , this must rank with all the president 's men ! their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film . yeah , like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie . maybe my vote will help balance this out .
this version moved a little slow for my taste and i suppose i have problems with this play to begin with . but first the movie , it 's a typical tv movie version of a play which means it does n't have the flair of the original film version with william holden . what they could n't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras ? why move the movie up to 1966 ? so you could give the little sister a line about the vietnam war protests ? why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement ? as for the casting , some hits some misses . jay o. sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with josh brolin . brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes . he 's believable as an ex-bmoc jock but he does n't have the raw sensuality of william holden . i always thought brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him ( pardon the pun ) . gretchen moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played . she did n't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required . maybe it 's because she and brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be . but then again holden was ten years too old . bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and mary steenburgen ca n't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing blanche dubois or katharine from `` the taming of the shrew '' . as for mr. inge 's play , i always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue . `` the twilight zone '' i believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode , `` spur of the moment '' where a young diana hyland was being chased by a bitter older diana hyland , because the younger diana hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to hal carter .
`` the leap years '' is a movie adapted from an e-novella by singapore writer catherine lim , which became the first singapore novel/novella to be sold over the internet . the film had a tortuous post-production schedule : shot in early 2005 , it was slated for release at the end of 2005 , but only turn up eventually 3 years later , on the 29th february 2008 , a leap year . before i say anything , i must first admit i 'm no fan of the romance genre , so i may be a little biased against this film - i watched it merely because it was a singapore production , and that it 's available for borrowing at my neighborhood library . here 's my two cents on the movie . let 's just start by saying that other than qi yu-wu 's ks and wong li-lin , everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian . the love interest is a eurasian ( ananda everingham ) , and wong 's trio of buddies are all , er-hem , eurasians . does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more `` in '' than the common chinese ( or whatever asian race you are ? ) i do n't know , it sure seems that way . also , everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical `` anglified '' accent which does n't exist anywhere , certainly not in singapore . it 's the kind of `` semi-perfect english '' that authorities would like us speak , but which does n't exist anywhere outside , say , the mtv channel . the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted , not helped by the lack of true-blue singaporeans in the cast . the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one-liners after one-liners . after twenty minutes , the `` wit '' of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichés . i guess i did n't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable . there are other incredulities in the film . i ca n't for one believe that ks ( played by qi yu-wu ) would fall for one of wong 's girlfriends . and the scene where the bridegroom says , `` go , before i change my mind , '' has been used in a hundred east asian ( korean , chinese , hong kong , taiwanese etc ) tv serials ... so 4 stars for this film . the production value is fair , and wong li-lin tries her best , but she 's not helped by the script . joan chen has a 15-minute bit-part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot , but , hey , her role is just cameo . if you come across `` the leap years '' in the rental or library , you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiosity 's sake , but otherwise , for people who do n't exactly enjoy the romance genre , you can decide whether or not to give it a miss .
argh ! this film hurts my head . and not in a good way . maybe it 's just my growing hatred for the action genre , but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals , i still regarded this film with dislike . now i utterly despise it . take one fairly good fast-paced story . keep the title and throw the rest away . instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing ( why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena , what about the cameras ? why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room ? ) the whole film screams eighties , from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes . ugh . do n't watch this film . i know some people liked it , but some people get off on being peed on and i do n't understand them either .
a romance without feeling , a drama of issues without point ( or drama ) .... this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account , as if it is n't trying . or as if the director/editor/scriptwriter team is n't really trying . the actors are able -- they need better support . one element that does n't fail is the score by george delarue . beautiful and moving . what a shame it 's attached to this film . in a good film actors ' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact . this editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement . the love scene is particularly grating in this respect : an insult to the talents of the lead actors . there is another element in the film that works : location photography . notably one moment in grand central station . i 'd guessed in advance what was going to happen ; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking . some commentators on this board have pointed out that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the maccarthy scare . the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society , it switches into conventional romance ; before any human feelings can move us , it 's away on a ( predictable ) 'thriller ' escapade . just as the film insults the talents of the actors , it insults the issues it 's pretends ( and fails ) to take up . you are warned .
had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution . how do these people get through film school ? who gives them money to make this crap ? could have been so much more , fine lead actor , and i always like fairuza balk , but come on , the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired , and it sure does n't make for good films . the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say . this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making , just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges . that can work , if the director actually has any kind of vision , or has a brain that knows when it 's in the presence of potential , but here it 's just space filler , of no consequence . i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit , and was yelling `` you lazy bastard '' at the screen when the credits popped up .
someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film . firstly , it is an absolute impossibility that this movie was made in 1993 . the fashions and music dictate that this is seriously 80 's . my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed distributer picked it up and released it to a disbelieving world . there is a plot . kind of . a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into whomever he chooses . at this point i feel obliged to point out that the loner 's favourite song is london bridge is falling down . why is this his favourite song ? because he 's an idiot . we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity . it gets even stupider . the loner is the nostril picker . i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose . that clears up the title . he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls . and kill them . that 's more or less it . the acting is universally appalling . every single performance in this movie sucks . in fact , i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie . it really is that terrible . the nostril picker appears to the audience as the nostril picker . the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down . man , i feel like an idiot even typing this . anyway , it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls . and not in a good way . there is even an extended montage of scenes where the nostril picker is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top . it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded . i 'm not even going to describe it . you 'll know it when you hear it . and you 'll agree with me . there are some scenes of violence , sure . and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a transsexual . there is even an immortal bit of dialogue , that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john milton , where the nostril picker says to a prostitute , ' i 've got the cash if you 've got the gash ' . lovely , i 'm sure you 'll agree . utter nonsense .
unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague . awful - why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap . the plot premise started out strong enough - i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over . what a waste . this film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it - i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else 's evening . hay - what a christian act on my part ; - )
there are n't many good things to say at all about underneath , soderbergh 's untrue endeavor into neo-noir . soderbergh remakes robert siodmak 's decent noir criss-cross faithfully , not altering the plot very much at all , however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere , giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places , lifestyles and anachronisms . soderbergh , who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the ocean 's series with great style and atmosphere , takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest , dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s . nightclubs have terrible , revoltingly dressed garage bands , peter gallagher 's uninteresting version of burt lancaster 's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos , tvs , and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film . it could 've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score , more flesh to its characters , more than just william fichtner giving performances that are n't wooden , a crisper pace . unfortunately , underneath has none of these things . soderbergh , a fine director , does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time . that disposition works wonderfully when he 's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned , or a social or character drama like traffic or sex , lies and videotape . with a movie like underneath , it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer .
much has been made of rohmer 's use of digital technology to 'fill in ' the background . at times it works well , the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king 's execution is particularly striking . at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look , resembling a home video . however , the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer . we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters ? to be frank , i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke . the other major failing , i regret to say , is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role . she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance . ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion . her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler ( an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel ) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience . also , watch her hands when she is expressing emotion ! all in all a very disappointing film , particularly given the positive reviews on this site .
i do n't quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10 . what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes . there are so many clichés in that flick , the women 's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake . there 's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts . it 's not funny enough to be a comedy , it 's too fake-sad to really touch , so in my eyes it 's just not good . watching it i could n't believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland . but .. maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation ? who knows . definitely one of the oddest movies i 've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way ! sorry .
oh dear , jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game , and he 's way out of his league . the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff ( 80 's action b'movie king ) , michael jai white ( last seen in the sci fi flop spawn ' ) as well as surviving the games ' william macnamara ( who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film ! ) stoop this low for employment . if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half . after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky 5 on tv , which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison , i think that says more than enough ! ! !
if i were to create a movie thermometer , this movie would be absolute zero . out of ten stars , i would rate it as follows : plot : zero stars video quality : zero stars sound quality : zero stars acting : zero stars it is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera , made up a plot and shot a movie . it is so lacking in any artistic value that i 'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie . however , something is to be said for the abysymal depths . the `` shootout '' in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scenes ever . first of all , the combatants simply wave plastic guns at each other , jerking their arms back and forth to simulate recoil . the pair actually `` duck '' each other 's non-existent bullets . no squibs , no sparks , no blanks , just waving spraypainted squirtguns around . if you want to see two grown men play `` actor '' , give it a spin someday ... after you have cleaned the fridge , combed the carpet , polished all of the doorknobs , raked the gravel , straightened the books on the shelf , etc .
the forest is n't just your everyday standard slasher/backwoods cannibal fare , it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well . the story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip . a cave dwelling , cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them . there is something you do n't see every slasher . director don jones gets an `` a '' for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level , the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman ( michael brody aka gary kent ) . the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest . they realize too late that someone is stalking them . they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare . our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film , except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw , pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife 's lover . the forest has a good story line but the movie just does n't work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting . 4/10
this movie ( not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder ) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink-bombs in history . beware : the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex-addiction . the film is not an exploration of anything , and it is no more erotic than staring at one 's own warts . the script is pointless and meandering , with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes . however , even the sex scenes are lame lame lame . except for the first , they are around three seconds long ( then again , maybe my version was cut ) and comically overwrought . if you are looking for a decent film , you do n't want this . if you are looking for a titillating sex-flick , you do n't want this . whatever your life 's goals , desires , or perspectives , you do not want to watch this movie . how they got rosanna arquette , natashia kinski , and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme .
overlong drama that is n't capable of making any real point . so she became an actress - so what ? she learned to love - big deal . there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations , but the kind which is bad for the movie , causing it to often seem absurd . summer phoenix , playing the lead , talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person , so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point . we are told early on ( in that `` barry lyndon '' -like narration ) that she learned to hide her emotions , which certainly explains her autistic stone-face , but the movie suffers for it . she basically walks around like a zombie , and her success as an actress is n't quite credible given her lack of emotions . occasionally , the movie had that dull , sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie . is it one ? i would n't be at all surprised . summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix . nepotism rarely works . if you 'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list , with over 350 pictures/entries , contact me by e-mail .
i really wanted to like this , but in the end it 's a poorly made film with too few laughs . the politics are spot on , it 's gon na offend the hell out of republicans but that 's what it 's designed to do . that alone gives me reason to chuckle . the problem is , it looks like it was made in a real hurry ( like about a week ) . and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer , which seems to be completely off topic . turiqistan is obviously iraq , or afghanistan , or any other number of countries the us has f * * ked with since the 50s . the humour is a little dark ( amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation ) but it is on the mark , especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction ( `` democracy lite '' ! ) however like a lot of satire criticising the us , it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured . i guess it 's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point . who knows . i prefer more of a nudge , wink approach - a bit of subtlety . but that 's just me . anyway i might watch it again , perhaps i missed something . i 'm hoping `` w '' is more on the mark .
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . there was a bit ( but precious little ) of good acting , primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg , who only appeared once and had no lines . otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . the plot line was rather weak , and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation . certainly not one of the year 's best .
admittedly , i watched this piece with already very low expectations . dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego . this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was 100 per cent humor free . it is rude , offensive , redneck and blatantly anti- women . as such , it is a creation befitting bohlen , but the average viewer will be rather put off by it . no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater : it would 've bombed big time ! not even the expense of 6.5 megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap . save your time ... and money !
there will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only bugs bunny kiss ( technically ) another man on the lips . there will be a time where it wo n't be duck or rabbit season . there will be a time where the tazmanian devil will be dubbed politically incorrect . but so help me now is not that time . nobody really wants an 'extreme ' version of our beloved loony characters . whoever it is in marketing who comes up with `` corn nuts : corn gone wrong '' and `` extreme doritos '' and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever does n't mean they know jack about kids . i think that they 're doing a disservice to children , depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time . this show disgusts me , and it 's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue . they misuse good voice talent , like phil lamarr , michael clarke duncan , candi milo , and so many others . it lacks style , humor , character development , and most importantly , heart . the show , like it 's repackaged characters ( slam tasmanian , rev runner , ace bunny ) is but a shadow of it 's former , timeless and beautiful self .
this was a cute movie until the ending . the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense . the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her . it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver 's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back . this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them . it was a despicable movie for that reason .
this is an amateur movie shot on video , not an `` electrifying drama '' as the dvd liner notes falsely boast . i have seen much better stuff from undergrad film students . the bulk of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around jakarta . this movie could have been made using a single video camera , but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was bounced together later . the editing is extremely rough . the final edit was probably done with two cameras , bouncing content back and forth , instead of with a proper editor . perhaps they did the editing in the taxi too ? the english subtitles were written by someone not fluent in english , e.g. , `` where you go now ? '' to say the production quality is on a par with blair witch is generous . if you 're not scared away yet , this film was an ambitious and creative endeavor , with lots of cool and funky images from all over jakarta .
this is one of the worst movies ever made . trite . predictable . flat . the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona . i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden cia/nsa prison to torture suspects . often bad movies have some redeeming features , this has nothing . if i was in it or worked on it , i would change my name . truly a turd . hard to write more than this , but i feel the world 's film watchers needed a head 's up on this . on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you ca n't stand . you could send it to politicians you dislike , in laws , ex-wives , teachers you hated , former employees , dick cheney , w. , and a host of others .
another too bad the lowest they can go here is one . otherwise this would get an easy zero . truly one of the worst films i have ever seen . in fact were peckenpah 's name not on the thing i would never have guessed he did it . actually one of the people in san francisco i know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that sam was just plain snockered . it shows in spades . the laughing bit at the early part of the film is the only thing in this entire mess worth a second look . not even gig young is watchable . this is a true test of masochism . had i been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it i would have jumped up screaming . and now i truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave . what a mess , it seemed less written than made up as they went along . it 's not only a bomb but a bmob spelled backwards . yikes ! ! ! ! !
i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mst3k , and oh boy , even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad . imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey . the highlights ( what little there were ) came from the special effects , which were `` ok '' . the acting for the most part was also `` ok '' ; though nothing special , it was of a higher quality than other b-movies i have seen in the past . the rest of this movie is dismally bad , the camera work often looks like they 've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along . the story ( if it can be called that ) is so full of holes it 's almost funny , it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place , or needs human flesh in order to survive . the script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid . the climax to movie ( if there is one ) is absolutely laughable . if you ca n't find the mst3k version , avoid this at all costs .
not the greatest film to remember paul naschy by . gaston ( guillermo bredeston ) is probably the worst swordsman i have ever seen . zorro would be ashamed ! his only salvation came as the competition was just as bad . this film is described as adventure and horror . forget the horror - there is none . no nudity , no blood , no monsters ; just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron ( paul naschy ) who wants to be king . the main feature of the film was seeing graciela nilson , who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss . where did she go ?
this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life . ( besides farenheit 9/11 ) . all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while 80 % of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore . global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more . most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together . this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies . liberal blindness ! an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage !
you 'd think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better . sadly , the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain-addled . the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family . everything is so very peachy and swell -- the family adores bergman and things could n't be more perfect . well , that is until the mother ( fay wray ) dies , the stock market crashes in 1907 ( wiping out the family 's fortune ) and bergman is forced to go back home to france . this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet , but not bad . later , after the family 's fortunes have improved , bergman returns . the four boys are now all grown and there is n't really a conceivable reason why they 'd hire her once again as a governess . but , briefly , everything is swell once again . but , when wwi occurs , the four all go to war -- gosh ! in the midst of this , one of the sons ( david ) brings home his new wife ( susan hayward ) . miss hayward 's character is as black and white as the others , though while they are all good and swell , she 's obviously a horny she-devil . to make things worse , she comes to live in the family home while david is at war . now here is where the movie gets really , really dumb -- brain-achingly dumb . hayward begins an affair with one of david 's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers , bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her , not hayward with jack ! why ? ! why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman ? this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter-snipe once and for all ! this is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad ... and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941 . the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward 's evilness to be exposed . this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess . as expected , however , the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again -- -happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut , hayward . the film suffers because of poor writing . hayward 's affair made no sense -- at least in how it was handled . and , having characters who are so gosh-darn good or evil ( with nothing in between ) sinks this movie to the level of a second-rate soap . the only thing that saves it at all is the acting -- -they tried as best they could with a turgid script . suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken !
as you may or may not have heard , there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film . one may then ask why the title suggested such a thing , but really it 's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either . there was absolutely no story or plot , just things happening . the acting was incredibly bad , worse than safeauto commercials bad . not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but i think there was only one scene with zombies even in it . their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl . the scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer ( i 'm not kidding ) but they used chainsaw sound effects . this was undoubtedly the poorest movie i 've ever seen in my life . the only circumstance that i would n't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if i learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old 's . really though , even with all of the criticism i offer here , i 'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever , and because of this is quite comical . even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained .
well , what are the odds ! at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur-scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago , a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster 's egg that has been lying there for over a thousand years , i suppose ! `` the crater lake monster '' is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed , but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest . yes , this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing , but it 's also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it . half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch . these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake , but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word `` bait '' . it is mostly during their prototypic laurel & hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake . steve hanson , the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case , but only if he 's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area . halfway through the film , there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process . this textbook `` wtf '' moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country , like in new york city or something , and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake . only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and there 's an `` exhilarating '' chase through the woods , ending in the dino 's hungry muzzle . the absurd little details in `` the crater lake monster '' are too numerous to mention ! for example , this is probably the only creature-feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster . the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as i 'm concerned . it 's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it . night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight all during one and the same diurnal course ! the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film , especially since it 's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop- motion effects . the cute critter is a plesiosaur ; meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator . `` crater lake monster '' is a unique and unforgettable movie- experience that i can only encourage to track down ! the miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle ( and because basically , this is a very bad film ) should be put into perspective , because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value .
i was n't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes . thank god , because i was falling asleep . i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow , people , water , clouds , etc . unfortunately , that 's all it is . my preference is for its predecessor , the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original , powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes . try them both .
it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was . consequently , they had even more trouble delivering it . they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub-atomic particles . having established a fuzzy picture of heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale . then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers : positive thinking , interrupting bad patterns , always look on the bright side , etc . next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins : hormones which we more or less choose to create . if you are sad , you will create sad proteins . if you are happy , you will create happy proteins . it 's just so simple , is n't it ? interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda , a photographer who pops anti-depressants and hates her thighs . the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say , `` hey , amanda , just cheer up ! '' why ca n't she cheer up ? obviously it 's because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion , that 's why . the conclusion of the film ( which is basically the entire second half ) brought on a barrage of contradiction . we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings , but a collective consciousness , but we are individuals who can change the world , but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions , but we can choose who we are , and we have a purpose to do good , but there is no god because there is nothing better than us , so there is no such thing as right and wrong , so there is no such thing as reward or punishment , so nothing good ever came out of religion , but we should still do good anyway , even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is , except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate , and then crime will cease , and if we say nice things , our water will freeze into pretty shapes . still with me ? good because there is more . according to robert l. park in his book `` voodoo science '' , the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington , d.c. was a farce , the numbers were doctored , and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since . and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy ? this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweight . so does all this work or not ? i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse , one of the film 's three directors ( yes , three ) fielded questions following the show . i call myself lucky because i had first-hand confirmation that these people do n't know what they are talking about . several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband , a chiropractor , had to step in and recite the answer . i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political , and everyone , including ms. chasse , began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie .
it 's interesting how 90 % of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of `` * random username * '' from `` united states '' ( no state pride ? ? ) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies . i would delve further into this suspicious trend , but alas , this is a review of the movie , and not the reviews themselves . let me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan . this means i have seen a great many movies , from good to bad , and can wholeheartedly claim that facing the giants is , in fact , not a good movie . it has good intentions , but fails to meet many ( if any ) basic standards that i associate with a quality filmgoing experience . the acting : mostly terrible , palatable at best . hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me . the dialogue : clumsy , cheesy , the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you 'd see performed in sunday school or youth group function . the rave review robots revel in the absence of `` meaningless words '' , but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world , and the complete absence of it is palpable . let 's just say the mean ol ' head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than `` oh no ! '' when things are not going his way . the plot : mind-bogglingly predictable . it has been commented that this movie is `` not a hollywood cliché '' , and yet it 's like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for dummies ( including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies ) and just had a christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it . i 'm not lying or bragging when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception . only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here . the directing/editing : it , too , was patterned almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie template . still , acting aside , there were n't many noticeable goofs , so at least facing the giants was technically competent . the message : ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes . part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team 's eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole `` if we lose , we praise you '' part , because in the real world , you will fail at one point or another and it 's good to be prepared for that . but in the world of facing the giants , if you fail , clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating . another interesting question being , what if the eagles came across another team that had gotten religion ? would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves , or would the universe simply have exploded ? the bottom line : for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd lamenting the evils of hollywood , facing the giants will be another mediocre-at-best christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making . for everyone else , the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else . and a warning : any attempt to show this to non-christians will lead not to conversion , but to derision . i give this two stars , one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes , and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget .
i just watched this movie today and not only is it , terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man . i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it 's clear crisp just filmed view . thank heavens i work in a video store and i did n't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity .. do not buy or rent this movie ! ! ! ! ! you 'd have a better time watching dude where 's my car than this piece of crap ! and that 's not saying a lot for that movie either . the acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable . i was watching this movie and i wanted to kill myself during and after the movie . i walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie , i then took a shower and burnt my clothes . if i had half a mind i would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it ... well maybe members of al queda .. especially the ones we have in custody and also child rapists who are in prison on life sentences with out parole .... just make a set up like a clock work orange , and then force these cheese head to watch it over and over again .
... you know the rest . if you want a good zombie movie , do n't rent this movie . if you want a documentary-esquire look at `` hood life '' you 're at the wrong place as well . if you 're looking for a laughable piece of film , this is a real winner ! the acting is as flat as a piece of paper . the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by . i can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice . if i could hear a cardboard box talk , it 'd probably sound like this guy . oh yea , and the `` zombies '' did their best snake impression which is on par with their fantastic acting overall ( note sarcasm ... how did this not win an oscar for best make-up ) the quiroz ...... did not do any sort of directing . i felt like i was watching an improvisational period piece ( the period is more like 1990 's la ) the direction is however one-uped by the worst script i think to ever grace a movie . i have n't heard such lovely lines , like the epic one word beginning to the movie `` f * * k ! `` , since ice grill which was another `` urban '' thriller . this only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack ! all 3 or so songs of it ! all in all , what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled `` hood of the living dead '' ? i rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene , and boy it delivered and more ! i would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror ( yea right ... ) movie for the night . a memorable experience for sure !
i normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read , about movies few will see . however , in this case , i feel i must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it . i just finished watching it only five minutes ago . this is , quite simply , one of the worst movies that i have ever seen in my life . the acting is horrible , a plot is nonexistent , and production values are poverty level at best . i know that even a low budget movie can be great , but not this one . there is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan 's purposes -- more on-screen gore and slashing ! the grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen . while it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens -- especially the end scene -- there is simply not enough of it . the movie is just too long for it 's minimal content , too dialogue heavy , and consequently almost impossible to watch . what happens ? to put it all in a nutshell with room to spare , three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered . their car , of course , breaks down , and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people -- one of whom is the psychotic killer . all three are eventually murdered , one by one , off-screen , after what seems like an eternity of boring , slow-paced nonsense . as i said , the only things worth watching even once are the murders . please do n't buy it or rent it just for that , and do n't be fooled like i was by the misleading box art and movie description . save your money and your time .
what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery , shifting alliances did n't get hold of this concept first . he could have helped bring out the real potential , especially with the interesting character played by william bishop . as the movie stands , it 's pretty much of a mess ( as asserted by reviewer chipe ) . the main problems are with the direction , cheap budget , and poor script . the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept -- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces . what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole , instead of the sprawling , awkward mess that it is , ( try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can ) . also , a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots , and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious la outskirts . the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast -- hayden , taylor ( before his teeth were capped ) , dehner , reeves , along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths . few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this lowly obscure western , which , in the right hands , could have been so much more .
a resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge . a lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition . universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas . most of the budget was probably spent on lon chaney jr. to star as kharis , the mummy . other players are george zucco , wallace ford , turhan bey , dick foran and elyse knox . how much longer can this madness continue ?
ok i had higher hopes for this carnosaur movie simply because it seemed like the sequels were getting better as they came out . i did like carnosaur 2 better than 1 . i figured well this one is newer so it must be better right ? well ... i quickly learned i was wrong . i was extremely confused with the casting . they brought back rick dean for another spotlight character and michael macdonald as a police officer . now for rick dean lol , in carnosaur 2 i thought he fit the role pretty well and was n't really annoyed by him , now in carnosaur 3 wow they placed him as an elite soldier . now we are getting goofy here . the movie actually started out pretty good with a decent gun fight and dinos escaping out of there little freezer trucks , but as soon as scott valentines team showed up we had a mix of a romantic comedy with very funny performances from retarded and floppy dinosaurs . i 'll start with the raptors first , they had there tails drag the ground , which in the second one they were up in the air which looked more common for a dinosaur that can run up to 50-60 mph . now when they ran they wiggled back and forth and the heads did n't move at all . there hands were floppy all over the place and since they were extremely poorly shot by the director they looked stupid and out of place . the t-rex was extremely pathetic , they would of been better off using the one from the previous 2 movies . at least that one looked somewhat frightening . the one in this film looked like it was smiling all the time . the legs when it walked was hilarious , like it was john wayne in the old west all stiff legged and stuff . lol another thing i noticed is that the hands did not move , they were stuck next to its body so it looked and sounded ( god the sound effects were awful ) retarded ! ! ! now if i was the director and realized that i had this to work with maybe i would of maybe tried a little bit harder to hide the fakeness fact . as for the rest of the movie , well this was the sloppiest and loudest military team i have ever seen . the weapons they used would n't make sense for the scenario . they even had an arm wrestling scene inside the warehouse where the carnosaurs were roaming , now i was tickled at this scene because i thought that while this stupidity was going on that the dinos would get in there and cause some damage . instead the director wasted about 7 minutes of our time . i would like to look at this movie as the 3 stooges of dinosaur movies . you have retarded military , retarded dinosaurs , retarded scenario and you have a wonderful 83 minutes to spend of your day watching this . now i 'm not saying i would n't watch this , bc actually i do recommend everyone see this movie that wants 83 minutes of pure entertainment . it may seem like i 'm ranting but really i 'm hyping this movie up to what it is . its really a lot of fun to watch because while watching this you think to yourself , `` did the director really make this seriously ? ''
the first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters . however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick , a lame reason for akshey kumar to date 3 girls , very loud over acting by both akshey and john abraham . neha dupia was the highlight of the movie , paresh rawal did well but not as good as his performance in hera pheri . overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer . save your money and do n't watch this movie , watch hera pheri and hungama again ! summarising it : a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance , the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by preetam the man who bought us dhoom ! keep it up ! movie shot all in one room , new comers ( female cast ) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like akshey and john totally disappointed an established director like priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever !
since the 70s , writer/producer/director charles band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science-fiction , fantasy and horror b-movies . some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect ; many of them are pretty bad . trancers ( 1985 ) was one of those rare gems . a terminator style tale of time-travel and action , trancers saw tim thomerson playing jack deth , a future cop given the task of tracking down bad-guy whistler , who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor . whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers , converting them into obedient zombies ( the 'trancers ' of the title ) , and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future . jack follows him to 1985 , determined to stop him . in this 1991 sequel , jack is still living in 1985 . having destroyed whistler , he has settled down and married leena ( helen hunt ) , the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie . but , for jack , things do n't stay calm for long , and trouble appears in the form of whistler 's brother , e.d . wardo , who is trying to build a trancer army . trancers ii lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was . the story is difficult to pick up if you have n't seen the first film ( or at least not for a long while ) , and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects . gone is the inventiveness and wit that made trancers so much fun ; instead we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels like it was written on-the-fly . about the only reason i can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast , which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci-fi and horror movies : jeffrey combs , barbara crampton , richard lynch , martine beswicke . unfortunately , most of them seemed to be having an 'off day ' whilst filming trancers ii , and performances are mediocre at best . the trancers series obviously has its fans ; four further sequels have since been churned out . unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing , i ca n't imagine them being any good .
i live in salt lake city and i 'm not a mormon , so why did i rent this movie ? well because i live in utah and thought it 'd be nice to see locations i know in a film . i really knew going into it that i was n't going to get the inside jokes so i was n't surprised when i sat with the deer in the headlights stare . what i was surprised at was the ant-non mormon actions that were placed in this film . i know it 's a mormon film , catered to the members of the lds church , but i found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that is n't of their faith . every non mormon , which was n't many , drank , smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude , why ? that really ticked me off about this film , they made the mormons so pure , yet the rest of the state of utah i guess is filled with punk psychos just because they do n't follow the scriptures of the lds church . i can understand having the plots revolve around all lds members , but you 'd think salt lake city was 100 % mormon , which is n't even close to being the truth . and as i said , the non mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks , please ! i guess i just do n't get it because i do n't belong to their faith and i guess i never will .
why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain , they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie ? burt reynolds peaked , then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks . arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood , only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero . and here , loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this `` family '' adventure flick , which is an unbelievably tedious , childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis 's great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film . the story is pure humdrum . it concerns social worker murphy , contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one . chosen for what , i hear you ask . his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world . as the main demon , classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film , but hey , i 'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents . of all murphy 's films , this is easily the worst . i 've read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role , in a non formulaic kind of film , and while both points are loosely true there 's no forgiving the fact that the film - however atypical and non formulaic it might be - is an absolute load of garbage .
this is a typical `` perfect crime '' thriller . a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer , ignoring all the clues , immediately knows who guilty is . the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught . the result is like every single episode of `` columbo '' or `` murder she wrote '' . the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock ! this story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book . skip this one , you are not missing anything .
- when the local sheriff is killed , his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town . not everyone in town , however , is happy with what she 's doing . when the sheriff orders a curfew in town , the local saloon owner ( also a woman ) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff . there 's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love . - gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution . there 's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out . in more capable hands or with a larger budget , gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west . as it is , gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie . - there are just so many things wrong with the movie : a supporting cast with no acting ability , stilted and unnatural dialogue , and sets that look like sets . but the biggest offender is the editing . i was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors ( and horses for that matter ) obviously waiting for corman to yell `` action '' . the best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building . all of a sudden , they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles . or , take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town . we see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse . - it 's not as if corman did n't have a few decent actors to work with . while none were great stars , beverly garland , john ireland , and allison hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance . but , in gunslinger , they 're not given much to work with . - i have now seen both the mst3k and non-mst3k versions of the movie . i would strongly recommend going the mst3k route .
i think i agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake . even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average . `` dark remains '' is basically a ghost movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you . the movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely inter-webbed which even later are not tied together . a couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed . they move to a country house to flee their past and guess what ... the house is haunted , kind of . from here on dark remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed ( the first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good ) . ok , then ... woman sees ghost of daughter , other ghosts of people died in accidents or suicides appear , man tries to solve secret of houses past , woman gets depressed , strange neighbors appear . its pretty much all been there , but the premise of it being their own emotions is nice , so you wait for the twist . there is no twist , you are just confused by a haunted house history story , the strange neighbor , a totally pointless creepy prison and the dead daughter thrown together with a photo-idea reminding me a lot of `` the shutter '' . the end is ridiculous because when you start and end a movie this slow and with piano music its pretty lame to include some hoards of ghosts at once which look like a zombie flick , of course just to return to slow pacing and piano music . to make it short ... dark remains could have been a nice scary ghost story if the script was not trying to go everywhere and arriving nowhere.too many stories mushed together which just do n't make any sense and contradict in the basic atmosphere of the movie . and beside ... please never use abandoned prisons again . its so worn off and in this case it even makes no sense at all . `` hey , there is this creepy prison uphill , lets shoot there '' . i guess a lot of ingredients in dark remains were thrown in the mix like this .
i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources . i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film . i am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film , the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles . for the political buff 's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good , but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward , very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee . see it if your ready to focus 100 % on every minute detail or politics interest you . do n't see it , if you actually like watching films .
i had high expectations following `` my beautiful laundrette '' , `` bend it like beckham '' and ( less so ) `` east is east '' . the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen , as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series ( goodness gracious me , etc ) . this one falls flat . inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill . ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort , complete with strong regional accents , whacky over-acting characters , a `` those were the days '' soundtrack , and lots of `` issues '' in an attempt to be worthy . i found myself cringing at many points during this film . the writing is predictable . every possible cliche was dragged out and aired . in fact , i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that were n't . the characters were thin and cliched : the eccentric non-conformist minister ; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman ; the over weight , overbearing aunt ; the pushy indian parents ; the working class neighbour ; the 'wise ' profound grandmother ; the motorbike riding thug . the script was weak , with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken . and why it had to be set in the 70 's ( apart from needing an excuse for a 70 's soundtrack ) is a mystery . possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979 . i do n't know . even these things aside , good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity . instead , the usual `` bbc comedy '' suspects were wheeled out to ham it up . `` bend it like beckham '' had far better comic acting ( and serious acting , in fact ) than this , with a virtually unknown cast . in summary , a lazy cliched script , over acted , in a dull predictable story . give it a miss .
for two of the funniest comedians , the movie was awful . fast forwarded it and never got any better ! waste of time and waste of money ! tina fey is such a great writer , i thought that she would be so great in the comedy . the previews were so great , but they only showed the best parts of the movie . my husband even thought that for a chick flick , it sucked . what is up with that . movie was very slow ans boring . i will not recommend it to anyone at this time . i would like my money back for this one ! boo from us here in arizona . thanks but no thanks . who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant . i thought that it was going to be so funny , i have had my own children and i have helped others have children . it could have been more along the lines of reality .
how is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better flemish movie `` congo express ( 1986 ) '' ? there are also some characters in congo express put together without having really a relation to each other : jean , ( de congolees ) , the workman , the two taxi-drivers , the street-singer , roger , guy , lucienne and gilbert . of course , tom barman is a star and luc gubbels was n't . that should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script ( if there is a script ) of anyway the wind blows . the joke ( the only one ! ) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great flemish movie `` de witte ( 1934 ) '' where de witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes . some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after . tom barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres . another missed chance for flemish cinema .
i 'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and revolt of the zombies is one of the movies in the set . i am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter , which makes most of these movies a laugh riot . i had high hopes for revolt of the zombies , after watching white zombie , which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema ( think clive barker 's serpent and the rainbow and james bond 's live and let die funeral scene , not night of the living dead ) . however , even though the title includes the word `` zombies , '' it is little more than a love triangle , involving anthropologist armand louque , who is smitten with claire duval ; who in turn is taken with his companion clifford grayson . what a yawn-fest , my daughter fell asleep half-way through . i had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for -- the allies or the axis ; but , i guess that does n't really matter . i was shocked to see bela lugosi in the credits for this movie ; but , of course those were his eyes ( from white zombie ) serving as the mind-control device for the zombies .
the imdb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain 'spoilers ' . well , this whole film is something of a spoiler ... a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against , a tale of lost youth that does n't know where it itself is going . i just saw this at the tribeca film festival . this film was n't just bad , it was really bad . the acting is inconsistent , the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth , and farnsworth 's acting was very bad in particular . from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place 'graphic ' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios ... it sucked the big one . i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy , updated 'drugstore cowboy ' with a touch of 'natural born killers ' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking ( outside of some frat-level gore ) as the ladder . more than anything , someone needed to really a ) edit the screenplay ( there are some things in there to build on and clearly deals with a worthy subject ... if ham-handed in it 's attempt . ) b ) edit the film . if it was cut down to a core , it might be passable . i would go lower than 1 if i could ... like maybe zero kelvin .
'utter crap ' pretty well sums up what this .... '' movie '' was . i 'd rather examine the colon of an african elephant with a penlight than sit through this again . i think i 've wasted enough time watching this `` movie '' - i do n't need to waste more by commenting on it further ......
film version of sandra bernhard 's one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious . sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars , but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting , and fitfully funny . her fans will say she 's scathingly honest , and that may be true . but she 's also shrill , with an unapologetic , in-your-face bravado that is n't well-suited to a film in this genre . she does n't want to make nice -- and she 's certainly not out to make friends -- and that 's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way . but even if you meet her halfway , her material here is seriously lacking . filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and , though not directed by him , the film does have his chilly , detached signature style all over it . bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich ; their oddest touch was in having all of sandra 's in-house audiences looking completely bored -- a feeling many real viewers will most likely share . * 1/2 from * * * *
worst . movie . ever . what was the purpose of filming this remake ( aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie 's soundtrack ) ? zombies that * run * ? ? ? i guess the director never watched the original `` dead '' films , which show stiff-limbed ( from rigor mortis ) creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey . and how , exactly , did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve ? 1/10
the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff . i 've only seen perhaps eight of them , but comet over broadway is the worst so far . the very best thing about it is that it 's short . oh , and the orry-kelly gowns ( of course ) are fine . james wong howe 's cinematography is not . kay francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does . minna gombell whom i do n't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough `` burlesque '' dancer ( it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque ) . the closing shot - kay francis and her child ( when did the child learn that kay francis was her mother ? did i doze off ? ) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous . the whole film is so cheap , so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it : warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who do n't know , in warner bros ' cynical estimation of them , that what they 're getting is garbage .
this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey . sadly , the film ends up being too 'confused . ' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop ' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest . the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on . we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering . in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could 've been an enjoyable piece of escapism . here 's what 's concerning joe gavilan ( harrison ford ) at the end of the film : 1 . his real estate deals 2 . his affair with a radio psychic 3 . he 's being investigated by internal affairs 4 . the homicide investigation if you add in casey 's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father 's death . now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen . the impressive screenwriting acrobatics can not overcome the bad filmmaking . as if a ridiculous chase sequence was n't bad enough , one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour , was n't bad enough , joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun . all these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught . we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension . while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story , i wo n't . this could 've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time . harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting . sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable . while this will probably be better than the likes of `` the hulk '' and `` lara croft ii '' that still does n't make this film good . i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money , i 'm not sure if that 's true or not . what is true is that to get great box office you do n't need a great movie or a great actor , this film has neither in its lead roles . my advice to harrison ford would be : to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run .
not as bad as some are making it out to be , though obviously pathetic compared to the original . in my opinion amitabh was great as the villain babban singh - try not to compare to gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect . other than some mediocre action scenes however , the rest of the film is flawed . character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless , with many loopholes , and missing pieces of information which i would n't have known if i had n't read the back of the dvd case . the worst part of the movie was the support roles from nisha kothari and especially this new dude called prashant raj . nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open . as for prashant raj - seriously who is this guy ? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks ? . his acting ability is zero and he has the same tone , dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene , whether it be action , comedy , or even a scene when someone has just died . ajay devgan was average , at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion . overall , rgv 's aag is worth watching for amitabh 's solid performance , and also a very sexy urmilla matondkar in a special appearance .
chilly , alienating adaptation of rebecca west 's book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired ( now there 's an original idea ! ) . it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie , which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks . this extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co-stars jackson , christie , ann-margret , and ian holm , but the burners are all on low . there are a handful of good scenes ( particularly whenever jackson is on-screen ) , but bridges ' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film 's dulled-out color is enervating . long on the shelf , this `` soldier '' is best left forgotten . * 1/2 from * * * *
i had the pleasure of viewing this movie early and i have to say i thought that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hanks , which i thought was pretty good ... i was right ... in all honesty i thought it could have been better ... sure there were some funny moments but it just did n't seem to hit the mark with me ... the acting was ok and the storyline pretty well follows the original but i think it could have been so much better ... this movie i 'd say is for teens and the young of heart ; full of female bodies , alcohol and sex ... it 's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again . 4/10 is my vote for this one .
it took 9 years to complete this film . i would think that within those 9 years someone would have said , hey , this film is terrible . i 've seen better acting in porn movies . the story is tired and played . abused child turns into serial killer . how about something new for a change . how about abused child turns into a florist ? at least that would have been a new twist . why is it that everyone with a camera and a movie idea ( especially unoriginal movie ideas ) thinks that they can be a director ? i do admire the fact that they stuck with this film for 9 years to get it completed . that shows tenacity and spirit . with this kind of drive hopefully next time they can focus it on a better script . if you want to see a failed experiment in indie film making from a writer/director from michigan see hatred of a minute . if you want a good movie from a michigan writer/director stick with evil dead .
even if you subscribe to the knee-jerk anti-free-trade politics of this movie , it is still just the same tired note , played again and again and again . clink clink clink . even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles , the reverend billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure . the clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on tv before he climbs back into bed that night . he has a pretty wife , i have to admit , but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie . the interminable bus rides are the worst part -- with progress shown -- can you guess ? -- by a colored line moving across a map . aww , you guessed . oh well , it has the virtue of being short . is that the only favorable thing i can say ? hmmmm . yep , afraid so .
unfortunately , this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so . it 's complete rubbish acting . as another member said , this movie is a good example of 'how not to act . ' i have n't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time . the actors ( can you call them 'actors ' ? ) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog . i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is , you would have to see the movie ... but that would be akin to torture . i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines , and the rest of the cast with their accents ( fake or contrived ) is equally heinous . another actress with the fake british accent was pretty , yes , but good lord was her accent terrible . mix that with her ( lack of ) acting and you have a disaster . she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl . oh my , we just got to the scene where the leading lady 's lover says `` really me ? '' after a forced crying scene from her . laughable . no , really , i just laughed out loud . the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film . some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice ( minus the actors ) . the old magic potion lady ? what ? ! another member mentioned the 'modern ' love song that was in the movie . totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago . i understand the movie was considered 'big budget ' in thailand at the time of it 's production . i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie . just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good ( or even mediocre ) film . i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10 , but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating . 2 out of 10 .
this could well be the worst film i 've ever seen . despite what mikshelt claims , this movie is n't even close to being historically accurate . it starts badly and then it 's all downhill from there . we have hitler 's father cursing his own bad luck on the `` fact '' that he 'd married his niece ! they were in fact , second cousins . hitler 's mother , klara , called his father , alois , `` uncle '' because alois had been adopted and raised by klara 's grandfather and brought up as his son , when he was really his nephew . alois was much older than klara and so as a child she 'd got into the habit of calling alois , `` uncle . '' the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers . we see hitler chase the dog through the trench , when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him . in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man , but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors , and every last one , we are told , is killed outright . how then , if hitler was the only person to survive the scene , did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told ? did hitler himself go around `` boasting '' about it ? - i do n't think so . next up , hitler bullies and intimidates a poor , stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross ! i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland , and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop , because i 'm certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce . all the grotesque clichés are here , not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagner 's music upon the little man . if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side . then they might have discovered that franz lehar 's `` merry widow '' was more likely to float the fuhrer 's boat than any `` flying dutchman '' from the cannon of richard wagner ! hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music ? i could go on but i 'd be at it for hours . give it a miss .
i was in second grade , 12 years ago . i remember it clearly . we were learning about space . all little kids want to go to space , right ? well , after i saw this , i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally ' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind . i had no idea that this was a movie . i thought it was some news program or something . i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds . ' so , recently , i get this movie again to watch , realizing my favorite actor , joaquin phoenix was in it ( then known as leaf phoenix ) . i can tell you , i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting . i mean , when andy is in space , she moves in slow motion , did you ever notice that ? i do n't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow . the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank , and begins to float backwards as the security doors close . little max is trying to pull her in . suddenly , we get a major close up on max 's face as he shouts ( in slow motion ) `` whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg ? ! ? ! ?

a family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order . people die ( and so will you if you try to sit through this ) if you 've ever had any desire to see bad actors- many with ill fitting dentures-act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance . this is just awful . its so bad i thought al adamson , one of the worst directors ever , directed it , but i was wrong . its so bad i do n't want to say anything more about it , not because it is n't polite but because once i start i may not be able to stop . avoid
this movie is a re-write of the 1978 warren beatty movie , `` heaven can wait '' , but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of mr rock . the premise remains the same : lance barton , ( rock ) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god 's representative , mr king , to come back to earth as someone else . as in beatty 's movie ; he chooses the murdered charles wellington , a rich white man , all because he fancies sontee jenkins ( regina king ) who happens to turn up at wellington 's house during the murder . the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work . also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real 'white ' wellington , fail miserably . improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in `` down to earth '' .
after viewing this film , i felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration . selma blair is a fabulous , currently underrated actress and max beesley was rather charming in `` kill me later '' . the story , while not exactly original , certainly showed some promise . none of that mattered though ... at all . i do n't know what her deal is , but director dana lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director . she slowed footage down , sped footage up , reversed footage , used awkward camera angles , used annoying color filters , made a zillion quick cuts , jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious `` modern '' soundtrack of blaring junk . i ca n't remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film . her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of . it is crammed down their throats . there are a couple of good scenes in `` kill me later '' which show what could have and should have been . unfortunately , just when things would start to show promise , ms. lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again . it 's a shame because blair and beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart . 3/10
this is a thriller with a good concept , good acting , good photography and good intentions all around , but which is confused and disjointed in execution . garcia stars as john berlin , an l.a. forensic detective who has moved to a small california town at the behest of a friend of his on the force there . he soon becomes involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder which leads to his theorizing about the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes in . the known victim is theorized to be blind , which leads to a romance with a blind girl - believed to be a witness - at a nearby school for the blind . despite a basically intriguing story there were too many quantum leaps and plot holes in this movie where i found myself wondering , 'how the hell did we wind up here ? ' or 'how did we find this out ? ' i found it confusing and disjointed , despite the good acting , etc . john malkovich has a small part toward the end as an f.b.i . investigator out to get berlin . not recommended .
gday mates ! just watched croc hunter the movie . it was alright but the show seems more real . this just seemed like a longer animalplanet episode with funnier lines and more characters . a few things : steve described snakes fangs like hypodermic needles . yeeeowch ! for reals you know that hurts . and cant they jump up high ? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff . there was two major cleavage shots in this movie . when terry find that baby joey she goes like `` we have to nurture them , just like a baby '' . woah ! i thought she was gon na up & breast feed that kid . that woulda made it pg-13 though . while on terry , did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show terry 's knowledge on ritual mating . she knows her sex stuffs . movie takes place in queensland , austrailia . i want a koala , dingo , and joey ! steve 's dog sui actually has a purpose in this movie . albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie . oh and if anyone else watches this , try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was right in shotgunning the croc . he was eating her sheep ! ! i would be mad too !
for die-hard judy garland fans only . there are two ( 2 ) numbers that are really good -- one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady ( you 've all seen the pics ) , and a pretty good number at the very end . there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny . but , basically , the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it 's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout . but it 's worth the 2.50 to rent the movie -- just be prepared to fast-forward it .
whew . what can be said about gymkata that has n't already ? this is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end . if you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing , this is the perfect movie to get . from cabot 's wild-style mullet/sweater combo to parmistan ( and it 's four billion assorted ninjas ) , everything about this film reeks of crap . directed by robert clouse , the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in bruce lee 's game of death , he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent . a few other faces you most likely wo n't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well , from buck kartalian to tadashi yamashita , although you wo n't remember them or care about them after the movie is done . supposedly based on a book called `` the terrible game , '' which , if i could find a single trace of it 's existence anywhere i would be interested in reading it , to see where this thing went wrong . instead , the book apparently is a figment of gymkata 's imagination . probably something clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea . pick this one up and yakmallah it for yourself . it is easily one of the best bad movies i have ever seen , and that is saying quite a bit .
`` trigger man '' is definitely the most boring and silliest movie i 've ever seen in my life . my aunt 's holiday videos are more fascinating . the actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com . they do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner . they walk and walk and walk through the forest . there 's more walking-around than in all three parts of `` the lord of the rings '' together . after the first hour , i began to read a porsche brochure while watching `` trigger man '' along the way . awful . a total waste of time and money . i 'd give that movie 0 stars out of 10 , since this is not possible , i have to give 1 star .
the movie lacks credence with the helicopters which did n't exist until the 1950s . but no woman would do what was done here , even a woman before the women 's movement of the 60s and 70s . about the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that germany would want to know where the landing would be . ignore for the moment that the british had captured all the spies but even if they had not , they would n't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the germans that the landing would be at calais . it is n't one major thing that makes the movie not work . it is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail . bad directing , bad scripts , no attempt at authenticity ( at all ) all combine to just make the movie fall flat . generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork . the suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected . on this one that game was over from the start . this spy was doing anything but spying . your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book .
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans have n't got the hang of farce . even when it has already been written for them ! the original film `` hodet over vannet '' is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 8/10 . it is n't just about a linguistic translation , but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely , robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap `` oops there go my trousers '' style of farce .
this 1973 tv remake of the billy wilder classic is inferior to the original . surprise ! first , the good things . lee j. cobb makes a terrific barton keyes . he 's not as good as edward g. robinson , of course , but he 's the only reason to watch this . this remake 's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of lola dietrichson , the step-daughter of the femme fatale , phyllis dietrichson . and that 's it for the good things . the bad things are many . the director records everything in an indifferent manner : if you watched the film with the sound muted you 'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening . because of modern bad taste , the film must be in color instead of black and white . because of 1970s bad taste , all the sets are distractingly ugly . walter neff 's expensive apartment , in particular , is hideous . the modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways . train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s , so mr. dietrichson 's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance . men stopped wearing hats , which prevents walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white-haired mr. dietrichson . women in mourning stopped wearing veils , which robs samantha eggar of a prop barbara stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene . ( oddly , lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them . ) stephen bochco keeps much of the billy wilder-raymond chandler script the same . but he makes a lot of tiny , inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular . outrageously , the famous motorcycle-cop banter is gone , but look closely and you 'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been . bochco may not be to blame . richard crenna is passable as walter neff . what might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid phyllis dietrichson . instead we get samantha eggar , who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from `` barnaby jones . '' but who can blame eggar ? with a director who barely seems interested in what 's happening in front of the camera , how could barbara stanwyck herself have come off well ?
the cars in this movie are awesome . the acting in this movie is awful . the plot and driving scenes do n't make much sense and are equally bad . if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster , save yourself the trouble and money . good movie for racing fans ? well , there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a nascar driver as a rally car driver . if you ca n't tell the difference , go watch it , you 'll have a blast . it really comes down to this , there are really really really nice cars in this movie , they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic . the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot . if you want to see hot girls , turn on mtv or vh1 instead . i am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie . if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie , they should be racing with rusted bicycles .
i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity . hyung-rae shim is lucky that bad film-making is n't a capital crime or he 'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster . i 'm amazed that this film had a $ 75m budget , but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop , that shim will hopefully , never get to make another movie the rest of the life and , therefore , not waste any more of filmgoers time . i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now . with the effects resources available to them , a great film could have been made with this budget . as usual , the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story . `` transformers '' was another visual feast with a weak script , but this makes it look like `` citizen kane '' .
this is a really bad film , with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though ! . all the characters are just annoying ( except lamas ) , and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for ! , plus the action is very boring . the film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring , laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up ! , plus it looks very cheap and amateurish ! . lorenzo lamas has a lot of charisma but he ca n't save this piece of crap , and believe it or not the opening was really cool , as was the ending , however the middle is incredibly boring , and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button ! , plus the dialog is especially laughable ! .there is a cool bar scene that i really liked , but once lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart , plus the scene where the villains torture jennifer 's family , and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable ! . this is a really bad film , with bad acting and a very boring pace , lorenzo lamas is really cool though ! , however it is not enough , not recommended . the direction is very bad . george erschbamer does a very bad job here , with mediocre camera work , bland location , and keeping the film at a boring pace . the acting is pretty bad ( except for lamas ) . lorenzo lamas is awesome here , and while he is n't required to act , he is quite fun to watch , and has a really cool character , and had a lot of charisma , however even he ca n't save this one , and he had no chemistry with the cast either ! ( lamas rules ! ) . josie bell is terrible here , and while she 's decent looking , she is n't very convincing and had no chemistry with lamas . cheryl jeans is hot , but does not have much to do but scream and scared , she did okay at that.robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain , and was n't menacing at all , he was laughable as were the other 2 . rest of the cast are bad . overall avoid ! avoid ! , even if you do like lamas ( like me ) . * out of 5
long , boring , blasphemous . never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll .
when it comes to movies , i am generally easily entertained and not very critical , but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start . i gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it . what a waste of some great talent ! i was very disappointed with this movie , as it was not what i expected .
this movie is just plain dumb . from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax , the film is an exercise in wooden predictability . mike hammer is one of detective fiction 's true sociopaths . unlike marlow and spade , who put pieces together to solve the mystery , hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well , too dumb to get away with anything . one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack . other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book . velda 's dance at the barre , for instance , or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back . and the continuity breaks are shameful : frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she 's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot . the worst break , however , precedes the popcorn attack . the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero , except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy . to be fair , there were some interesting camera angles and lighting , and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen , which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10 .
for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and `` film-making '' . as a reminder to those that live here - locales include boulder creek , bonny doon , davenport , big basin . etc . the bank was the bc firehouse ; chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236 , empire grade rd , and hwy 1 . production : jeffrey jones was the most approachable , matt broderick was above us all - even back then . as far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level . a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery . additional notes ; joe 's bar ( jed 's tavern in the film ) , original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw - the old erba 's parking lot was the town square , the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek ; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days .
once again the same familiar story about a man ( writer here ) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life : success . unfunny script ( we should `` go home and write better '' ) , ridiculous lines in order to understand the `` strong '' `` christmanish '' message ( our only aspiration in life is to find love , respect and a good friendship ) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil ( jennifer love hewitt is no sexy or evil at all ) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character . not bad efforts from the actors ( baldwin also as a director , cattrall in a `` sex and the city '' role again , aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role ) . p.s . try also a not so popular film from greece called `` alloimono stous neous '' , a brilliant adaptation of this myth ( an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth )
an acted/manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala . portrayed as a fun , secure ... but sad place , were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team , assembled in what seems like no more than a week ! the documentary 's main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of `` workers '' , even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved , except that the people who documented this , made them some sort of `` stars '' ( just like the title says so ) in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary . it does have , however , its own documented reality ... but , that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline . i would not accept to see it again ; but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only .
dreamgirls , despite its fistful of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway , has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals . however , that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen . unfortunately , what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact . first , the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor . there are lots of songs ( perhaps too many ? ) , but few of them are especially memorable . the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only - the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of effie ( jennifer hudson ) . the film is slick and technically well-produced , but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance . there is some interest in the opening moments , watching jamie foxx 's svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top , but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film , when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain , despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film . beyonce knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well , but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz . anika noni rose as the third member of the dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film . eddie murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown , but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact . foxx would seem ideal casting , but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored . the film 's biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant/oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of effie white , the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return . for me , effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie . the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side , but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion . from the start , effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious , egotistical , self-centered diva , who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part . when she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude , the charges are more than well-founded , but the stage show/film seem to think effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice . even though the film tries to soften some of effie 's harder edges to make her more likable , the charges still stand . her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that ( much like the talent card ) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable . indeed the only big effort the film makes to show effie 's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office , insists that the girl has `` no father '' and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows . in the hands of a skillful actress , the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma . unfortunately , hudson is not that actress . she sings well , but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments . effie 's signature moment ( the aforementioned and i am telling you ... number ) is well-sung by hudson , but emotionally flat in the acting department . effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament , but hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number . all in all , not quite the emotional highlight one expects . the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver foxx into hudson 's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone . foxx 's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers , but the film 's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous , not to mention pretentious and condescending , particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle . the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit , drained of emotion , energy or anything that can be described as dynamic .
just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival . just before going i came here to see how it was rated , and at that time it was 7.4 , a pretty nice rate ... after 15 minutes i was dying to get out ( never did this ) , but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening . i did not like at all , the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere , the characters are shallower than the dialogs , nothing lead anywhere , and the worst and worst : plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie . despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself , i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping-up all the time on her lap-top ; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen ! all of this would be bearable if the plot , characters , romances , anything was good , but was bad , really bad ! a `` do n't know how to do '' sex-in-the-city . do n't waste your time or money .
2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous . i thought with a cast of james woods , cathy bates , randy quaid , lou gossett , jr. , and henry thomas - how could it miss . i was wrong . i can only wonder what drugs sam shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble . i 'd long suspected sam s. of being kind of nuts , this film , based on his play , confirms it . this is the kind of artsy b.s . that actors love to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . however , for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash , there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie . you have n't seen dysfunctional families until you 've seen this bunch . pa is crazy , ma is crazy , the son is crazy and the daughter is , oh yeah , crazy . they also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush , especially the teenage daughter . in addition to the above , as if that were n't enough , the plot -- and it 's so thin you could read thorough it -- has a hole in it the size of alaska . ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . as it turns out so is pa. now i do n't claim to be a real estate expert , but the last time i checked , property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . if only one of them owned the property , then the other could not legally sell it , so it would be pointless for that person to do so . mr. shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact , and therefore , his plot does not work . not that anything else was really working anyway . the only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see james woods in full frontal nudity , and i ca n't imagine why anyone would want to .
dreadful horror sequel to `` the howling '' . this picks off with karen white 's funeral ( she was killed at the end of the first film ) . stefan crosscoe ( christopher lee sadly ) arrives there and tells karen 's brother ben ( reb brown ) that karen was a werewolf . he 's going to transylvania to kill striba ( sybil danning ) the head werewolf . ben and a coworker of karens ( annie mcenroe ) join him . a terrible script , bad direction , inept editing and truly horrendous acting by brown and mcenroe single handedly sink this one . the werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark -- for good reason ! they 're terrible when you see them . subpar special effects also -- although i did like the cartoon lightning that comes from danning 's fingers . there 's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and danning takes off her top at least eight times during the closing credits ! there are a few good things -- i found the village in transylvania amusing -- it looks like it came from a universal horror flick from the 1930s ! there are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes ; brown and mcenroe have good bodies and lee and danning are good in this -- but they ca n't save it . really -- why did they do this ? where that they hard up for money ? ? ? this is one of imdb 's lowest rated movies . that alone should tell you something . supposedly danning was horrified when she saw the movie -- i can understand why ! a must-miss .
a pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script . ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel . i think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed . there is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either . watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying . spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible . he is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero . it has to be a mysterious virus . after the inspector says this , the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony . this disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel . end spoilers overall , this movie is extremely lame . i do n't understand why it got a dvd release when so many deserving movies have none . my only guess for the dvd release is that suzanne summers is featured in the film . this is a movie to avoid .
i see that someone already thought of a similar analogy , which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after i watched this movie . they said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot . besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child-porn ( which i feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically , i would liken this movie to a recipe that 's been torn in half . it 's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients , with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product . from the start , character development and story development are lacking ... unfortunately , many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think `` ahh-ok ... finally we are going to find out something more about why this scene is going on ... or ... who this character is ... or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and get involved more with this inter-character relationship ... etc . '' but no such luck ! on the contrary , many times i was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled , only to find that whatever mini-plot within whatever mini-plot ( and that poorly presented ) was just a ruse . why i stayed with it till the end is a mystery , other than usually ifc has better selections and they gave it 2-1/2 stars ( another mystery ) . it 's not that the characters are n't likable to some degree , or that you ca n't identify with them or their humanness at all ... it 's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort . i notice this was shot around santa cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone 's film school project . i wish i could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half .
...... this film is pretty awful , the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse . the jungle music , juttering demons , and fluorescent uv style blood/teeth/eyes give it that `` awful '' look , and the script is dire ..... this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it . it 's also predictable but not in a good way . nothing this film does is in a good way . i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are . ( oh and the acting does n't let the film down , it 's also terrible )
i loved the first `` azumi '' movie . i 've seen ms. ueto in a variety of her tv appearances and i 've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks . i have to say that this movie was much weaker than i 'd expected . given the movie 's cast and set up in `` azumi '' , they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie , but instead it was slow , plodding in parts , and sprinkled with very poor , unconvincing , and wooden acting . when they bothered to reference the first movie , they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak . in `` azumi '' , the title character is the best of a group of superior killers . in `` azumi 2 '' she seems somehow diminished and less-impressive . that 's not to say it was a total loss . there were a few decent fight scenes and some over-the-top characters . unfortunately , the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that shusuke kaneko and yoshiaki kawajiri are not ryuhei kitamura and isao kiriyama . the latter two truly captured the `` manga '' feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite `` got it . ''
this is an installment in the notorious guinea pig series . a short lived japanese tv-show , that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show . this short in the series is , like all the other films in the series , practically without any story . a group of guys have captured a young woman . they tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her . they beat her , pour boiling oil over her , use pliers on her and finally , in `` loving '' closeup , push a needle through her eye . this is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig movies , and one of the first . it was probably this film , more than any of the others , that gave guinea pig the rumour of being snuff . they certainly gave inspiration to nicolas cage 's movie `` 8 mm. '' . these movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles . they have progressed to more polished , but equally graphic movies like `` naked blood '' . they probably fill the void left by the mondo movies , that got slightly cleaned up and became reality tv . not recommended , but will probably allure those who will see anything once , and wonder why afterwards , i know i did .
good actors and good performances ca n't mask a pointless script , bad dialogue , and patterns of behavior spiraling into nothing you 'd care about . the most interesting character is david berkowitz . no character development - no growth , no interest , just some suffering for no particular reason , teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain .
what can possibly said about this movie other than , `` viewer beware '' . christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do , because this was harmful to my eyes and ears . i am rarely this unsatisfied with a `` b '' horror flick , but this movie could n't even bring a little scare to a five year old . the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like , like nothing can stop their maniacal rage , but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus , it 's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he 's far too stupid to be dangerous . all in all a total waste of film .
first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies . nothing , and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling . most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end ! ! some people want a movie that makes them `` think '' through the entire thing , to which i say ... '' more power to you '' ! ! i on the other hand just want to be entertained . which brings me back to this stinker , entertainment it is not . this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time . seems that most here agree also . most of this did n't make any sense , and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and .... well i guess you see where this is going . avoid , this one sucks .... bad ! !
this movie had some great actors in it ! unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start . it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time . maybe it was the musical score or the director himself , but one thing is for sure the make-up artist needs to get another job ! the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces ! would not recommend this movie to anyone , no wonder it never hit the theaters . cuba gooding jr. / james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all . the plot was great just needed a whole lot more .
before watching this film , i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw ( complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs ) . mjh 's name on a movie would typically turn me away ( ugh , can we say gross ? ! ) , but i still wanted to give it a try . starting out , i was a bit interested . the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters ( especially the man that played `` sulley '' ) . mjh was even worst , but i continued to watch . however , the ending was the biggest joke of them all ! i seriously sat in shock thinking `` that was the ending ? ! is this a comedy ? ! '' . i thought this pile of crap was funnier than the `` scary movie '' spoofs and that is really saying something !
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects , this one was a sore disappointment . the actors seemed stiff and uninspired , as was the dialogue . westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days , but movies like `` silverado '' prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . considering that , it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing , much less creating such a weak film as this one . if you love and are looking for a good western , keep looking !
the first scanners may not have been a great movie , but at least it was original.there is no such novelty to this one.the acting is worse , in my opinion , and the story is slower and nothing special.i also did n't like the dialogue.and the special effects are no better than in the original.this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it , is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that does n't make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting , this could have been a decent movie.i actually could n't get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me , this is a forgettable movie , and not much more.despite all that , there are worse movies.being in a generous mood , i 'll give scanners 2 a 4/10 .
i was fortunate enough to meet george pal ( and still have my ds : tmob poster autographed by him ) at a convention shortly after the release , and asked him why he chose to do the film `` camp '' . before he could answer , two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio `` knew best '' and how `` no one will take such a film seriously '' . i had been reading the bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend ( comicon attendees of the 1970s will recall blackhawk and his band ? i was in a couple of years of that with him ) , and had higher hopes than what we got . the flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously , and so doing 'camp ' was the only way . several other fans jumped in on my side , with pal listening as best he could . at the end of the little event , pal came up to us and apologized , wishing he could have done more and better . star wars put the lie to the flacks , and a year after pal 's death , spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise ... if it had n't been for the flacks . tear out the memory or history of doc , and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller . but destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib . doc savage can still come to the screen , and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to indiana jones , but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero . sidenotes : yes , there was a second script for archenemy of evil , and it 's a lot more serious . yes , there was simultaneous footage shot , but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors . and , yes , there _is_ a one-sheet of ron ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol . ely 's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie , and the words `` doc savage : archenemy of evil ... coming next summer ! '' postscript : if anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san diego for the convention , smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are . at the time , they were doing dorkknobs and fu manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants , and carrying paramount portfolios .
i 'm a christian . i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians , however . as a rule , they are `` know-nothings '' when it comes to movie production . i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . however , they did a hideous job of it . the acting was horrible , and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion , one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across . not only was the movie terribly made , but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . however , in this `` critique '' , those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . in short , the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen , and i would not recommend it to anyone , except for comic relief from the every day grind .
this adaptation , like 1949 's * the heiress * , is based on the henry james novel . * the heiress * , starring olivia de havilland , remains as a well-respected piece of work , though less true to james ' original story than this new remake , which retains james ' original title . it is the story of a awkward , yet loving daughter ( leigh ) , devoted to her father ( finney ) after her mother dies during childbirth . the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever , and considers her , as well as all women , simpleminded . when a young man ( chaplin ) of good family and little fortune comes courting , the father is naturally suspicious , but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man , is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him . leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style , like she 's acting through gritted teeth . she 's not bad in this , and she handles her role relatively deftly  it 's just an awkward role for any actress , making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses . while the character garners a lot of sympathy , she 's not particularly likable . the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin ( previously seen in * the truth about cats and dogs * ) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune , or is really in love with her . maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt . finney is marvelous , of course , as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience , but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves . but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune ? this is only one instance where * washington square * differs from * the heiress * . another instance is the ability to stick with it . it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet , offering too little story in too long of a movie .
the movie itself is not too bad ; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script , but it is watchable . what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies , and on top of that for movies like this one . i have to admit i had never heard the man 's name before watching this , but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed . the voice is crap , the face is a bad rip-off of legolas , the posture is horrible , and he can not even properly coordinate all three of them . said to say , i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco , because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only . too bad i was wrong . these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance , and they are the main reason i give this a 4 . i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast ... and can not believe it .
to quote the film , `` it 's better not to know . better still to forget . best of all to be abandoned . '' oh , the irony . a ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film , but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film , and you feel like you 're being preached to from the start . it 's as if the writers ' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show . fitting , maybe , for a film like the hitcher , not a russia-set horror film . the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly , not scary or meaningful .
a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot ( if anything , the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot ! ) , this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo ( with a strong dose of erotica ) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful ! here , we get the usual group of people ( an acting troupe ) stranded on an island ( to which they were invited by a count  since he had become enamored of the leading lady , a dead-ringer for his missing spouse ) ! the characters are pretty much stereotypes : middle-aged but dashing hero ( played by giacomo rossi-stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy ) , demure heroine , sluttish companion ( recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot ! ) , a meek but devoted stage manager ( forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior ! ) , a couple of lesbians , a mysterious gardener ( the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who , for once , gets in on the action , if you know what i mean ) , an envious housekeeper ( nominal star femi benussi though , for what it is worth , this is really an ensemble piece ) , a religious fanatic of a butler , an impressionable chambermaid , etc . while the film is not by any means unwatchable , the atrocious dubbing , snail 's pace , shoddy production ( with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film ! ) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters . besides , marcello giombini 's score , though pleasant in itself , comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances ; that said , the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one ( considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here ) .
bizarre take on the cinderella tale . terribly poor script , but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance . visually stunning in some parts , but that 's about it . the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s . fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel . if you 're really in the mood for a cinderella story - i suggest `` ever after : a cinderella story '' or `` the glass slipper '' .
there 's nothing particularly original about this story of corrupt unions on one side and the `` chief attorney '' on the other . the stark but unimaginative lighting and photography stems from the fagged out noir cycle . the story could easily have been out of a warner brothers drawer with george raft in the lead . the performances are routine , the direction flat , and even the set dressing perfunctory . ( an alley is shown by a single plaster wall of simulated brick . it has one poster on it . the poster says , `` post no bills . '' ) we are introduced to the story and some of the characters by a portentous narrator who informs us that , while most unions work hard and honestly to advance the causes of their members , a few are corrupt . but we do n't really get to know much about the unions or how they operate , although i suppose they were fair game after the success of `` on the waterfront '' a few years earlier . here they 're just a peg to hang the tale on . the real ring leader is a disbarred lawyer who runs things through three or four thugs . the district attorney ( or whatever he is ) finds out , like dana andrews did in `` boomerang , '' that the wrong man ( dick foran ) is charged with a murder and he spends the rest of the film almost alone , digging up evidence of foran 's innocence . he gets into fist fights and shoot outs like any inexpensive movie private eye . brian keith is the d.a . he 's shown some insinuating displays of talent elsewhere , but here he spends most of the time speaking quietly and staring at the floor . elisha cook , jr. , is a likable rummy but ca n't do a good drunk . beverley garland is okay but is undermined by the direction , which has her gawking in a night club when she should be furtive . the remainder of the cast would be suitable for a tv series . and nobody is helped by the writing . when a `` b girl '' is about to be shipped by the union mob to the filippines , someone advises her that she only has to learn a few words of spanish . `` i only know one word , '' she says , `` si . yes . '' the writers have not trusted the audience to know that `` si '' in spanish means `` yes . '' the plot is clumsy and has holes in it . keith visits a witness in her flat over a night club . he enters the door and has a gun shoved in his back by a yegg , but he outwits the heavy and knocks him out . then the orders someone to call the police . the rest of the scene , played out at some length in the night club downstairs , forgets all about the police and they never show up , nor are they expected by anyone . it 's nothing to be ashamed of , and some people might enjoy it , but there is similar stuff , better done , elsewhere .
there are pretty landscape shots . writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths . with lesser actors this show would be silly . 'art must uplift humanity or it 's bs . ' not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side . the lead character even says those who do n't drink hide the shadow side . wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes . there was n't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain . all the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes . the discussions between the characters was grade school , trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted . i tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here . i had to dig deep to see those i agreed with . i figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie . i was moved only once towards the end . the kid was way too passive . the scenery was nice and the music ridiculous . just my opinion but nowhere show for me .
first of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great , the monster looks superb and the cgi is reasonably done . it 's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment , * * * * * * * * spoilers below * * * * * * * * from the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-american , normally this sort of stereotyping would n't bother me ( we brits get enough from hollywood ) but here it 's not subtle about making the americans brain-dead morons . it goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a yank has raped the directors mother . the grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill . here we are introduced to the olympic medallist auntie and drunk uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death , then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying . hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis ! the whole virus sideline is ridiculous . if the americans know there is n't a virus , why are they wasting time , money and resources investigating ? the us government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent korean for nothing , making the americans look evil ( or stupid ) , it was n't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect . the movie is about hunting the monster . us and korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible . the only people hunting the monster , in the whole of korea , is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day ! naturally a few us/korean agents try to stop them along the way . the sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end . it was clichéd , you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part ! and my final annoyance , how the hell did that kid survive at the end ? the monster had been swimming with it 's head underwater for about 5 minutes ! why did n't the monster eat the kids in the first place ?
i can always tell when something is going to be a hit . i see it or hear it , and get a good feeling . i did not get a good feeling watching the preview . i was not at all enthusiastic about this film , and i am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films . i was in fact proved right . the first thing that threw me off was the title . not that i have a problem with ebonics ( i am black by the way ) , but for a movie they could have used a better title , and for this time use a title that does n't have bad grammar . i heard the dialog , saw the acting and all i could do was make faces . i also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone . at least `` you got served '' was better than this in my opinion . even the soundtrack did n't thrill me .
revenge is one of my favorite themes in film . moreso , `` the futility of revenge '' is one of my favorite themes in film . having seen gaspar noe 's irreversible ( 2002 ) , i was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme . instead , this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film 's lack of conviction and focus . * spoilers * the end scene , a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene , came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy . however , the film does n't even follow through with this . instead , the drawn out scene ( which far exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized ) is crowned with a shot of dawson 's face in an expression of either regret or `` this did n't fix anything '' while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background . my problem with the scene was n't one of shock , but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience . i mean , do we feel bad for the rapist ? do we rejoice in dawson 's revenge ? are we disgusted by the brutality of it all ? do we feel dawson 's moment of regretful clarity ? aside from this failing , the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance . character 's are thin , dialog is monotonous , etc . normally i try to take films on their own terms but descent did n't really seem to know what those were . thumbs down .
how disney can you get ? preppy rich girls act like idiots , buy a bunch of stuff , and get taught a lesson . is disney trying to send a lesson to itself ? that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human ? whatever the psycho-analysis , this movie sucked . the girls want a rich party for their rich lives . but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant ( yes , milk ) going to employ the workers . they keep it afloat until daddy comes home . and the man at the beginning , who appears to be the one that takes the money , is the one . but the ending is dumb . webcam in the cayman islands ? huh ? not worth my time ever again . but it is better than howl 's moving castle . `` d- ''
we now travel to a parallel universe where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters flattening cities are part of the daily routine . it 's the world of godzilla , rodan , mothra ghidrah and their kind - a strange world , and one made even stranger by the appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called gamera . forever in the shadow of the monolithic toho studios , second rung daiei studios were more famous for samurai sagas than monster movies . in the mid 60s they decided to join the giant reptile race and designed a rival monster series to toho 's mammothly successful godzilla . they wisely chose gamera as their flagship - a giant turtle that shoots flames from between its snaggle-teeth , and spins through the air by shooting flames through its shell 's feet-holes ( and at one point you almost see the paper mache shell catch fire ! ) . the first gamera film `` gamera the invincible '' ( as it was sold to the us ) is a virtual mirror of the first godzilla film , only 10 years behind . american fighters chase an unmarked plane over the arctic to its fiery demise - the nuclear bomb on board ignites and awakens the giant gamera from its icy slumber . feeding off atomic energy , it immediately goes on a rampage , and the world wants to destroy gamera once and for all , but a little japanese boy named kenny , who has a psychic connection with the giant turtle and even keeps a miniature version in an aquarium by his bedside , believes gamera is essentially kind and benevolent . he 's like a little jewish kid with a pinup of hitler . `` gamera is a good turtle , '' he pleads , then sulks , and puts on a face like someone 's pooped in his coco pops . miraculously the world 's leaders listen to him , and so begins z-plan to save the world and gamera from complete destruction . released in 1965 , gamera was a surprising hit . the annoying infantile anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in both japan and the us , and the sight of gamera on two feet stomping miniatures of tokyo and the north pole is gloriously chintzy . most surprising of all is the longevity of the series : eight original gamera films , plus a slew of recent remakes . not bad for a mutant reptile whose only friend is mewing eight year old milquetoast - and if i hear `` gamera is friends to all children '' one more time i 'm going to crush tokyo . which appears to be an easy task in the parallel universe where children are smart and turtles are bigger than a seiko billboard in the 1965 turtle-fest gamera .
these were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom . first , i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that . then , reaching 70th minute i was convincing myself that it 's only a few more minutes , and i lasted to the very end which i 'm kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for human 's patience and crap tolerance . was it worth watching at all ? well , as i wrote above , if you want to test yourself , give it a try and if you 're strong willed enough , you may even last to the end ... the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all . all happenings in the movie , you can be sure you saw somewhere before , and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel .
i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week . my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too . i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen . boy , was i disappointed . this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable . george c. scott is an excellent actor but in this , it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 % of the time . the rest of the time he was quite flat . i realize that this was made in '84 , pre-cg effects , for the most part . but it looked to be very b-movie quality , especially the encounter with jacob marley . the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story : when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world , observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime . i will admit that mr. scott did a good job with the `` reformed '' scrooge at the end . that was a refreshing portrayal . i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden . and tiny tim ... oh do n't even get me started on bad child actors ...
after a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene , 'set it off ' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink . this is a movie that deals in nasty , threadbare stereotypes instead of characters , preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting , and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought , wit or feeling . in short , it 's no different from 90 % of hollywood product . but it 's the racial angle that makes 'set it off ' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making . posing as a celebration of 'sistahood ' , the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican-american 'gangsta ' stereotype . the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag . not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man , it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else . worse , 'set it off ' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure . serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery , then they 're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished , the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring , guilt-ridden liberals ( tell that to rodney king ) , and aspirational 'good ' sista , jada pinkett smith , follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend . 'set it off ' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film , pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it . while the likes of 'shaft ' and 'superfly ' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots , they had a freshness , an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch . 'set it off ' would n't be worth getting angry over if was n't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african-american film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s .
i could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd , but i decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe * something * would happen . this is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx , kenneth herts , who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie . that 's what he wanted , anyway . what it turns out to be is a lot of acting , either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit , and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster attacks in the river waters ( oh , and what luck , a woman just happens to be naked in it ... even though there have already been disappearances ! ) this is just nonsensical stuff , but i suppose it 's not too harmful ; it 's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi-interesting peek at brazilian `` culture '' ( which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of 'hey , this is not america ! ' ) . but whatever hope the director had in casting mitchum or carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog . it does n't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the `` action '' happens , it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal . usually i would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with monstroid or monster or whatever it 's called ... nah . if you happen to get the elvira dvd double-feature of this ( bad print with bad transfer quality ) with blue sunshine , make sure to skip this one . unless , of course , you 're an elvira die-hard and ca n't help yourself to hear her luscious commentary ; personally , i 'd rather get joel or mike nelson with the robots from mystery science theater on this roast turkey .
do n't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers , leaves a lot to be said . i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro . the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores . a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context ( see the movie elsa and fred for example ) but it should not permeate the plot . the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film .
a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott . g.i . jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals . the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character o'neil played by demi moore . there is no particular message or point in this film or then i could n't reach it properly . it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film . i really ca n't understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert ? ! it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique . when i look at his latest film , black hawk dawn , there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes ( which are plenty ) and they are very intense and directed with skill . the whole finale in g.i . jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing . this is ridley scott 's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known . still i 'm glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scott 's abilities , but they are very few in this film . a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics ( blade runner , thelma & louise , alien and so on .. ) of this talented director . so i 'm forced to give g.i . jane 4/10 .
i was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent indian candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . the producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it 's getting talked about ! i was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason , they are usually true . but there really was n't anything funny about these stereotypical characters . the `` fresh of the boat '' dad , who does n't understand his daughter . the radical feminist muslim daughter ( who by the way is a terrible actress ) , and the young modern indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can ( he 's a pretty good actor , i only see him getting better ) . it is very contrived and the dialog does n't flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed , and do n't really care to watch another episode . i did however enjoy watching a great canadian actress sheila mccarthy again , she 's always a treat and a natural at everything she does , too bad her daughter in the show does n't have the same acting abilities !
firstly , i must admit that it is n't a good movie . and , i would never watch this movie if pacino was n't in it . the movie is about a publicist 's strange 24 hours.and he is overworked , dizzy , sick and sometimes regretful.i do n't like the character at all.it 's really boring , after 20 minutes you may fall asleep.and i do n't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie.just because of money or what ? since i 'm an avid pacino fan , i bought this 2002 movie people i know.if you have n't bought it yet , do n't even think about it , it 's just a waste of time .
i was drawn to this movie , curious to see how they have adapted hubert shelby 's brutal novel . i thought that a literary piece of such depth , with a rich tapestry of characters , horrid situations , and social critique could not translate into a bad movie . i was wrong . this flick is a terrible movie experience , not for its content , but for its form . director ulrich edel executes , in my sincere opinion , a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book . no wonder edel is a tv director ; this movie looks and feels like a bad `` made for tv '' flick . some of my views on this bomb ( * * spoilers ahead * * ) : - lack of directorial creativity . the scenes are slow , feel slow , look poorly shot , and barely ever move from an anchored position . the only liberty they take is in the cinematography area , with a nice dark tone . other than that , the movie has the same technical creativity as a tv soap-opera . - all the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters . the problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot : motivation . all these characters move around like robots , without a clear motivation for their action . they seem to do things out of the blue , like robots , for no reason at all . edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character 's motivations , and by avoiding developing each character 's personality to its full extent . this lack of character development is blatant on tralala . jennifer jason leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute , but her alcohol-induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained . it looks extremely stupid , as we see this character doing this out of the blue . this is a clear example of poor character development . the movie also has many secondary , token characters that do nothing , feel nothing , and add nothing to the plot . i would have liked to learn more about harry 's wife , for instance , and the interaction between the two . that 's another missed opportunity . edel only approaches character development with harry and his fixation with his gay lover , only to screw it up at the end , not clearly explaining -again- his motivations . the thugs are also a joke in their lack of development . - the soundtrack is one of the worst i 've ever experienced . terrible job by mark knopfler . i seriously expected more from the former leader of dire straits , but his job in this movie is seriously lacking . at times , like in the battle between the union workers and the police , the music seems totally disconnected from the movie . it also feels completely poor and anachronic ; i could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a casio toy keyboard . it distracts from the actual action . - the book adaptation by desmond nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story . it feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book , that they forgot to actually develop the characters and , once again , explain their actions and motivations . i seriously can not recommend this movie , not even to a shelby fan , because it can ruin the original book . it 's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel , and shows very little creative input .
if i had not read pat barker 's 'union street ' before seeing this film , i would have liked it . unfortuntately this is not the case . it is actually my kind of film , it is well made , and in no way do i want to say otherwise , but as an adaptation , it fails from every angle . the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working-class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished . i was put through tears , repulsion , shock , anger , sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street . excellent . a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of , but i novel i simply could n't put down . depressing yes , but utterly gripping . the film . oh dear . hollywood took barker 's truth and reality , and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . a beautiful film , an inspiring soundtrack , excellent performances , a tale of hope and romance ... yes . an adaptation of 'union street ' ... no . the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda 's character , their stories are touched on , but many are discarded . i accept that some of barker 's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing , and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just is n't practical , but the content is not my main issue . the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost - darkness and rain , broken windows covered with cardboard , and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine , pretty houses , and a twinkling william 's score . if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of 'reality ' , i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'schindler 's list ' ... but without the happy ending .
this comedy is really not funny . it ' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact . it 's a caper film so derivative -- yes , even back then -- it has no snap . the cast is adequate . more than that it 's hard to say . however , what 's nice is that the players are unfamiliar . at mgm , this would have starred robert montgomery . the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses . we can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today . and the production values are n't awful . yet it makes no real impression . it 's a generic knockoff . and who wants that ?
the plot is about the death of little children . hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings . during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter . in the end the serial killer get caught . that 's it . but before you find out who dunnit , you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors . it is unbelievable how bad these actors are , including hopper . i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time . just do n't watch the movie . i 've warned you .
possible spoilers . although there was some good acting - particularly chloe sevigny , and radha mitchell in the comedy half - this simply was not an engaging film . the segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not obvious . this viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves ; i thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding melinda would be the same people , just reacting differently ( more of a `` he said , she said '' premise ) . however , what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women , both of whom happen to be played by radha mitchell . the two playwrights in the opening scene - the comedian and the tragedian - supposedly take the same premise and go from there , but the two stories are only tenuously related . they do little to support the topic of discussion , which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy . nice cast , but a disappointing film .
one star . that 's all this documentary deserves . i have n't felt this disappointed in watching a movie , let alone a documentary , in quite some time . i 'm a big fan of the `` walking with ... '' series , including it 's nigel marvin spin-offs , for all their gleeful fun yet informative information . and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures , the subject is still interesting and unique to explore . having seen all the other docs from the series , i figured i need to see this one as well , especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places . well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc ... what were you thinking ? ! lol . though the information that they were able to get through was interesting , the presentation failed in every other way possible . it had a terrible flow , was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say ( with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place ) , horrible effects ( that includes the few moments of cgi and especially the makeup effects ) , and overused mtv-style camera effects . speaking of the makeup effects , one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man-in-suit horror movie . well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous . none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions . the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way , or looks remotely real . it does n't even look like it was taken seriously . it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had . remember the episode in `` walking with dinosaurs '' of the fate of the ornithochirus ( sp ? ) ? that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it . it 's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all . when you are more engaged in the subject and it 's own personal story , even one that is just speculation , you care more about the facts surrounding it . the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration ( at least in the bbc version i saw ) and the music . otherwise , do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh ( which i did frequently , but usually followed by rolling eyes ) . this does not belong on the shelf with the other `` walking with ... '' docs . and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series ? hmmm ...
`` the cat 's meow '' contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue , and some fine performances , a few of which surprised me . eddie izzard is more effective than i expected as chaplin ( partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer ) ; joanna lumley is compelling as novelist elinor glyn ; and kirsten dunst is winning as marion davies ( though why movies never use her real-life stutter is difficult to explain ) . but these elements do n't add up to a successful whole . the screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes -- the meetings between davies and chaplin are particularly well crafted -- but not so hard on the big picture . several minor characters do n't need to be there , and do n't behave consistently . the basic plot is full of illogic ( e.g. , why does thomas ince think it 's a good idea to tell hearst something he really does n't want to hear ? ) , and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome . i 'd like to think a trip on hearst 's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates . davies is characterized as a standard bubbly flapper type , which is n't really accurate , and the screenwriter 's ideas about chaplin and love are implausible . strangely , bogdanovich , who seemed so connected to the thirties in `` paper moon '' , lacks a similar affinity for the twenties . he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream , which gives the party guests a very artificial look , and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period ( e.g. , `` yes , we have no bananas '' ) . when hearst insists everybody `` charleston , charleston ! '' it looks as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot . the lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies , i 'm sure , but not this time .
during the civil war , there were many cases of divided loyalties ; obviously , many occurred `` in the border states '' , where north met south by happenstance of geography . from the border , young father owen moore goes off to join the union army . shortly , confederate soldier henry b. walthall , separated from his regimen , wanders onto the enemy 's property , desperate for water ; he finds a supply where the unionist 's young daughter gladys egan sits . when the yankee soldiers track him down , little gladys innocently helps the confederate hide . later , when he returns to kill her father , the little girl 's kindness is remembered . a sweet , small story from director d.w. griffith . location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed . * * * * in the border states ( 6/13/10 ) d.w. griffith ~ henry b. walthall , owen moore , gladys egan
the first ( and only ) time i saw `` shades '' was during a sneakpreview . it had n't even been in premiere . i remember there was someone of the directors staff there , do n't even remember who . it was a belgian movie , we never heard of it , so we were quite neutral , not knowing what to expect . mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he 's stands miles ahead all the rest . he plays an actor who 's star has long stopped rising . he 's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled `` shades '' . as soon as the movie started , we noticed how much swearing there is . nothing against the occasional swear word . however this was way beyond annoying . whenever rourke uses the f * * * word to express something , it comes naturally . however , when someone from the cast , a non-english speaker uses the f * * * * or s * * * word , it becomes arrogant and aggressive . we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words . everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre . and we had to give a vote , but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 , and we were looking for the -10 .
this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history . its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish , with only good/bad characters . the world is just not like this , and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses , dilemmas , etc . however , what i hate most about this film is bola 's friend 's father . the director tries to teach us a good lesson : tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys , in fact they can be better than the average looking dad ( wow , this is like ... philosophy , or something ) . thank you , achero . i 'll propose you for the nobel prize of literature .
outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk , his show is terrible . nothing about lopez has ever been funny . i have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh . his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body . i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them . this guy has a grudge that wo n't end . i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves . the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent . canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes . might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay .
terrible movie . if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 , that should be banyo . what a waste of time . other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing , nada , zilch , nil . the dialog is cheap , and sexual clichés are all over it . the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own . the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do . if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting . the only good thing i can say about the movie is , wait , wait , there is nothing good i can say about it . i must have really disliked it to write about it this much . jeez !
how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel ? all it does is throw balls ! worst of all , it does n't compare to even the first installment of the series ! the comedy suffers from not being funny . where did all the unintentional laughter go ? enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long . bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout . what 's next , major league 4 : return to the little league ? ehh , could be ! leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all-star game . this one 's had three strikes too many .
as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour . however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw , who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she 's in . connery is fine as is fishbourne , but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality . and the ending is simply bizarre . the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner , so to compensate they added an overloud `` dramatic '' score . every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration , to the point where it becomes laughable . if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see , otherwise skip it .
this movie will promote the improvement of the mind . read a book ! it 's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make . i 've seen `` b '' movies before but the `` c '' movie has just been invented . i did n't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into `` knights . '' high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume . embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind . my roommate , who loves these types of movies even turned it off . now that has to really tell you something . if you watch this movie , and like it , i will pray for you .
a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film . the `` blonde wig '' half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers . the wong faye half ( featuring a very playful , if karen carpenter looking , faye wong ) holds much more appeal . all the ingredients are there , however , the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness . character development is uneven . emotion is missing . for music lovers , wong faye 's `` mung jung yun '' ( cantonese version of the cranberry 's smash hit `` dreams '' ) is used effectively in chungking express . faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called `` zhen tuo . '' both are on cd , although only `` mung jung yun '' is found on the official movie soundtrack cd .
this is quite possibly the most retarded 80 's slasher ever realized , but how can you be harsh on a film that features non-stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises , taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits ? prior to being a horror film , `` aerobicide '' is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids , silicons and other body-stimulating fitness products . if you 'd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80 's tunes , there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left . plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health-freaks with a big safety pin ( yeah ) . the film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun-bathing device . several years later people turn up dead in the same spa . you do n't really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there 's a link between the murders and the burning incident , now do you ? investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer ( and charles napier look-alike ! ) and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80 's beauty i 've ever seen ! looking through the credits , her name 's dianne copeland apparently , and she did n't do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile troma-movie called `` surf nazis must die '' . what a wasted opportunity ! she may not have been a great actress , but she sure had two other big advantages that would help her move upwards in show business . the amount of gore and the quality of the make-up effects are nothing special , neither . we 're treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh . the plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable , but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore , anyway . `` aerobicide '' ( a.k.a . `` killer workout '' ) is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night , but nevertheless feel like watching a film ! it actually would make a terrific double-feature with `` death spa '' . both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb .
having seen men behind the sun i guess i hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie . i was also quite interested to see someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of japanese atrocities , but this is not it . this plays like a bottom-to-mid tier european nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g . ss experiment camp etc ( perhaps more like deported women of the special section actually ) . granted it has a greater scope and more people running around , but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non-actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots , spiced up with the occasional poorly executed 'shock ' sequence . the admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power . watch channel 4 's 'the holocaust ' ( aired recently ( still running ? ) , as of 1 no 2006 ) for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war ( featuring excellent in-context use of actual footage ) . this is the type of treatment the horror of nanjing deserves , not this hackneyed exploitation garbage ( a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine , but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie ) . rating : 3 ( 5 as exploitation , 1 as a treatment of the subject ) .
this is without a doubt the worst most idiotic horrible piece o ' crap i have ever watched . this movies plot is that some guy goes crazy and dresses up as santa claus and kills people because he saw his mother give his father oral sex while he was dressed as santa clause . that is why he went insane ? is it just me or is that the worst damn reason for someone to go insane like ever ? and that 's not the only thing . i 'm being serious when i say nothing happens in this damn movie . nothing until like 1 hour and 15 minutes of it have gone by . there 's an entire friggin scene where he glues a friggin santa beard on to him . it 's a friggin minute long . who the hell wants to see that ? however i must say the ending of this movie made me crap myself laughing at it . so if you see this movie on tv or something come back in like 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch without a doubt the worst ending in all of cinematic history . and i 'm serious about that . it 's not even so good its bad , it 's tedious , it 's idiotic , it made me want to break the vcr . it 's just not worth your time also i 'm sure every other review mentioned this but the actress who played the mother on home improvement was in this movie for a split second . you want to know how bad this movie is ? i 'd rather watch home improvement for sixty six hours then even look at this movies cover ever again .
.... and after seeing this pile of crap you wo n't be surprised that it was n't published ! ! ! ! spoilers ! ! ! ! this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it 's one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : `` my god . what happened here ? `` `` i do n't know but they sure hate cats `` * the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you 're going to be watching a bad movie the reason sleepwalkers is bad is that it 's very illogical and confused . we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american coastal town ? having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - that 's the only thing we learn . we never learn how they 're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator . monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? there was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . i guess that 's so the production team can come up with an ending . it was that they started the movie my complaint lies we 're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis , clive barker and even stephen king make cameos . i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they were n't going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . that 's how bad sleepwalkers is * unbelievable as it seems that was n't the worst line in the movie . the worst line is - `` that cat saved my life ``
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long ? it 's terrible . it makes me want to shoot someone . it 's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie . i 'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense . i remember watching it when it first came out . i thought , hey this could be interesting , then i found out how absolutely , insanely , ridiculously stupid it really was . it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table . please people , stop watching this and all other reality shows , they 're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create .
i think that if i went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of english to come up with a script , it would make more sense than this . i could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film . this sounds really mean , but i 'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess ( see what i did there ? ) neither the skills to act or to write anything , ever . watch this only if you 're incredibly drunk , high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists . i will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom . after that , i will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my dvd player , fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery . acting - 0/10 plot - lol/10 breasts - 9/10
one can deal with historical inaccuracies , but this film was just too much . practically nothing was even close to truth , and even for the era , it was seen as silly . in defense of ford , it was revealed on an old talk show , that he was operating on the story as told to him by the real wyatt earp , who was obviously old , senile , and replayed the scene his own way . earp told the director about the stagecoach , and how it was planned to happen during the stagecoach arrival , so despite what other historians claim , wyat himself asserts that it was premeditated . this movie portrays earp as an honest man , and also his brothers . history does n't exactly say they were or were n't . most people like to interject a bit of deceit and lawlessness into their characters , but that is nothing new . the truth is probably closer to them being the law abiding sorts of gunfight at the ok corral . men who saw it as a career , and believe me , in the old west , you did n't have time to think about too much else . characters that do n't exist , characters depicted dying at the corral who really did n't , all make this a weaker film . it is further weakened by mature , who really did n't make a convincing doc . he may be the worst cast choice ever for doc , but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the era and closer to a feel for the truth . after all , ford did get information first hand from wyatt earp . it is also weakened by the all so predictable events involving the mexican girl . hollywood was very pro nazi in those days , and ready to kill off brunette women in very predictable fashion to show their patronage to hitler idealism . this occurs in most movies until the eighties . it is no excuse , and does cheapen the art , however . the actors who play the earps do well , and brennan is always a thrill . in fact , mature may be the only acting downside of this flick . still , it is the weakest of the old ok corral movies .
one of those thank-god-i-don't-live-there documentaries . this one tells of two warring factions in colombia , guerrillas and paramilitaries , and the surrounding peoples of medellin . guns , drugs and death run rampant . the guys , no older than 22 , not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail . the girls  not women , girls  always react the same way when one of them is killed , with tears and screaming . you scratch your head ; what did they expect , really ? i do n't know what 's more disturbing : the nightly shoot-outs and civil unrest , or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are . or , seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer , being all of what , 10 ? if you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more , be more , how many would choose not to stay ? based on this documentary , all , i 'm afraid .
i have read the other comment about this movie , and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person . however , this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen ( and thats topping a lot of bad usa network plus cinemax nights . ) whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one . this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever . i really think these people are insane . just save your time and do not watch this fllm . please - i wish that i had . the acting is horrible , the plot ( what plot ) is stupid and degrading and insane . i really do not think this should have been made into a movie . but that is my opinion , and i am trying to save you from wasting your time .
i 'm a big porsche fan , and the car was the best star in this film . haim , the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80 's is bland as per usual , and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless ; needless to say they were all very average . it 's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80 's - with some weird clothes , some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot . all in all , please do n't waste your time watching this unless you love 80 's movies , corey haim , or like myself , love old school porsches ( this one in particular looks great ) because life 's too short to watch crappy movies .
what a terrible movie . the acting was bad , the pacing was bad , the cinematography was bad , the directing was bad , the `` special '' effects were bad . you expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher , but even the killings were bad . first of all , the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes . i thought it would never end . they could have removed 80 % of it and explained what happened well enough . then , the victims were invited to the `` reunion '' in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on . one of the victims thought this was a little odd , but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway . finally , the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable . there is no reason to watch this movie , unless you want to see some breasts , and not very good breasts at that . this movie makes showgirls virtually indistinguishable from citizen kane .
* spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead * when this show first started , i found it tolerable and fun . fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked . it also had high ratings along with spongebob . but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show . first off , toilet humor is n't all that funny . you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp , but that 's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke . next there are the kiddie jokes . lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing . lololol ! ! ! i just ca n't stop laughing at such gay bliss ! somebody help me ! but of course , this show would n't suck that bad if it were n't for stereotypes . did you see how the team portrayed australians ? they saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving , boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert . but now ... is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all ... over-used jokes ! ! ! the show constantly pulls up the same jokes ( the majority of them being unfunny ) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever ! cosmo is mostly the one to blame . i hated how they kept on mentioning `` super toilet '' ( which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well ) and cosmo would freak out . and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode ? you know , the one in which every single parent ( oblivious to other parents saying it ) would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid 's room ? yes , it may be first class humor to some people , but it is pure s * * * to others . if i 'm not mistaken , i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show . thank god ! everyone around my area says it 's , like , the funniest nickelodeon show ever . i just ca n't agree with it i think it 's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday , only worse .
i was very disappointed by this movie . i thought that `` scary movie '' although not a great movie was very good and funny . `` scary movie 2 '' on the other hand was boring , not funny , and at times plain stupid . the exorcist/amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie . james woods was great . now , i 'll admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first , where i had basically seen them all . but bad comedy is still bad comedy . something that really hurt this movie was the timing , which ruined some of what might have been good jokes . scenes and jokes drag out way to long . also , the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again . for example , the talking bird . ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time . but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying . the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson ( chris elliott ) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless . some jokes even got repeated from the first movie . for example , the 'creaming ' i guess you would call it of cindy ( anna faris ) was funny in `` scary movie '' because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long , that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed ' her . but this time around it was out of place and not funny . the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around . the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film . tori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie . but i did enjoy shorty ( marlon wayans ) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film . the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film . do n't get me wrong , i love the wayans family and their humor . that is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes .
saw this on tv . i 'm glad i did n't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental . the movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner , to the snaking electric cables . the plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche ( using actual footage ) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down . the avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road . some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power . but the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier . do yourself a favour , do n't bother with this one not even on t.v .
this could have been interesting  a japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed american family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director . the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare , i.e . the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they 're expected to ! besides , it does n't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as , generally , the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way , such as susan george seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family doug mcclure and edward albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup ! at one point , an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually , he 's called upon to exorcise the premises . however , history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and mcclure , possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors , engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death ! at the end of the day , this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but , in no way , essential viewing .
it 's been a long time since i last saw a movie this bad .. the acting is very average , the story is horribly boring , and i 'm at a loss for words as to the execution . it was completely unoriginal . o , and this is as much a comedy as clint eastwood 's a pregnant schwarzenegger ! one of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . if they were hoping for a career relaunch , then i think it might never happen with this on their cv ! the script had the potential , but neither 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . fred durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest . i 'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - i highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total loss of time , but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like .
the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie i 've ever seen , but it is pretty far down on the list . when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i , one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions . and he succeeds , at least at first . a love triangle complicates the story some . this really was a tedious movie , with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who were n't . the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable ( not the zombie part of it but parts related to the `` romance '' ) . and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography , the camera work did n't seem to help the film much either . while i have seen a few movies that are worse , this is unlikely to please anyone . it 's bad , and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way .
yes i have rated this film as one star awful . yet , it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth . this truly is so bad it 's good . this is another k.gordon murray production ( read : buys a really cheap/bad mexican movie , spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960 's . ) it 's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i 'm sure some `` mood enhancers '' would make this an even better experience . i 'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said , a christmas movie with merlin , the devil , mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none . i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar 's `` a christmas carol '' . truly a holiday experience made in hell . now if i can only find `` to all a goodnight ( aka slayride ) '' on dvd i 'll have a triple feature that ca n't be beat . you have to see this movie . it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button-especially on the two dance routines ! this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese-guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience . feliz navidad amigos !
mark pirro 's `` deathrow gameshow '' of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts , but occasionally very funny nevertheless . this movie could certainly have been a lot better , the acting is terrible , and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times , but the concept is funny , and it has some hilarious moments . in the near future ( the year 1991 ) , game shows have changed . chuck todean ( john mc cafferty ) hosts a game show called `` live or die '' , in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives , and for money . candidates who fail , get executed on the air using many different methods , such as guillotines , electric chairs , and other , more bizarre devices of execution , followed by applause from the cheering studio audience . the show is , of course , more than controversial , and chuck has made lots of enemies ... `` deathrow gameshow '' is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects , and the acting is terrible , but it is without doubt fun in many parts , especially if you 're a fan of dark humor . you have n't missed anything if you have n't seen it , but it is definitely funny and a good time waster . 4/10
i just saw this film on dvd last night , and decided to check out the reviews this morning . it seems that `` i , robot '' has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb ( and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling , too ) . i find this somewhat surprising , as this film is not great ( or even good ) , but neither is it terrible ( or even really bad ) . what this film really is , is ... depressing . depressing that the us film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid , clichéd re-heats , and acclaim them as spectacular new works . this film as `` retread '' written all over it , from the plot line ( an uneasy mix of asimov and modern-day uber-action ) to smith 's character ( a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium ) , to the special effects ( that borrowed from matrix and a few others ) . `` i , robot '' is , sadly , quite possibly the perfect action movie for today 's audience : superficial plot , insipidly snappy dialog , and lots and lots of adrenaline . smith is mediocre , but we already knew that ( he seems to be hollywood 's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis ) . the story has lots of holes in it , of all sizes , but i do n't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice . perhaps a blockbuster by today 's standards , but very b-movie compared to true winners .
i must admit i do not hold much of new age mumbo jumbo . when people `` exchange energy '' i always wonder how much kj is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem . when energy `` is enforced '' i always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without nobel prizes . when people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life i wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station . but then again , this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them i find perfectly acceptable and entertaining . if this were the case with `` the celestine prophecy '' i would n't burn this movie down , but unfortunately it is n't . every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location . this results in many `` ah-s '' and `` oh-s '' , like i tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand . the direction is uninspired as well . you might expect something more from the guy who did `` what dreams may come '' , but hey , i supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a new york taxi driver : `` it 's your money , buddy .. '' the only one who seems to be having fun is all-time bad guy jürgen prochnow . not only does he have a job , he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring new age chatter . this movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up . at one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts . if you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids , take my advise : choose the latter .
first of all , the reason i 'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo . he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie . i was initially all fired up at reading one poster 's comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave `` the performance of his career . '' to me , it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie , and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment . then i thought to myself , what else has stevens done ? so i checked and , you know , that person was absolutely right . in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made , apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap , so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career . if you like columbo , see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one . do yourself a favor and save the worst for last .
elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order ada 's and her acting is even worse here . her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic . nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child ; at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed , as if she ca n't remember where she left her keys . this is an important true story , so it 's too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message . the rest of the cast is talented enough , but they just ca n't overcome rohm 's tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required .
pathetic . this is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to . the intentions were good , great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions . but the performance , damn ! i swear , in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera , or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear `` action ! '' . the battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real ? they could 've done more damage just by hugging each other . in the slow-mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing , waving their hands . only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized . but for what ? the story is so illogical and discontinuous , it seems like random situations in chronological order , sometimes not even that . the dialogs are dumb , the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in hong kong action movies . with a budget of 40 million , and you can see every dollar invested on the screen , in best case scenario , the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store .
note to self- just because a film is foreign , obscure , and stars catherine zeta-jones does n't mean it 's any good . such is the case with 'blue juice , ' a 1995 brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem ( to a dumb american , anyway ) an even more unlikely place to find surfers : cornwall , england . you might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing , quirky little comedy . if only . the film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable . the easiest way to describe it is as a sort of '90 's british version of 'grease ' without the dancing , but even that makes it sound better than it is . no , the best way to take it is as a little slice-of-life set in a small town . catherine zeta-jones plays chloe , a young woman living with a surfing instructor , jc ( sean pertwee ; you remember him ) . pertwee is actually the film 's star , and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees , the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this . in this case , it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist , a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer , and a fat nerdy guy who , in a needlessly extended scene , gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him . i ca n't honestly say everything that goes on in 'blue juice ' is predictable , since it 's set in a place and reflects customs and manners i 'm not very familiar with , but there 's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters . the comedy , though , is very predictable and tired . one can sense the set-ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue ( in american form , of course ) before the actors do . the relationship between jc and chloe is every bit as hackneyed . she wants him to grow up ; he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being . he 's afraid of losing face with his gang ; she thinks he prefers them to her . you get the idea . as i struggled to stay focused on 'blue juice , ' toward the end i felt , as the saying goes , that this was an hour and half of my life i 'd never get back .
what is happening to itv drama . first , `` losing gemma '' quite simply the worst tv drama i have seen in years , and now `` perfect parents '' a complete shambles from start to finish . whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there p45 by special delivery . in most drama/thrillers , a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop , but `` perfect parents '' took this to a new level , i suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense i felt i had been force fed on a lorry load of `` magic mushrooms '' , it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a `` drama by numbers '' involving some serious issues - religion , education , greed , fear , murder , paedophillia the only trouble was as the great eric morecambe once said when playing a piano , `` i 'm playing all the right notes , just not necessarily in the correct order '' . for your next script guys , i suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than `` script writing for dummies '' . due to the ridiculous script and the utter lack of tension in the direction , the acting was suitably low key , not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch . but i suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman attempts to deliver a script from itv drama department , make sure the letterbox is firmly nailed shut ! !
i know i 've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something ... i 'm not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b/w picture of phil silvers , jackie gleason etc . bilko was already 20 years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver 's bilko courtesy of bbc2 . i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin 's travesty if i had n't seen or heard of phil silvers - i do n't know - maybe i would have . some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10 ' admit that they have n't seen the original . i can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode . if after watching the original ernie , colonel hall , ritzig & emma , duane doberman , henshaw , dino , flashman , zimmerman , mullin et al you still think that steve martin 's film is woth anything above a ' 2 ' - i 'll stand you a pint ....
interesting idea and storyline which did n't quite work . when you see the film , maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did . i did n't really know who to root for in the movie , taye diggs looked bored as the detective , the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant . if the victim alicia ( mia kirschner ) had been more of a nice girl , we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice . the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls , turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead . i ca n't understand the moral message of this film , and as a detective story and thriller it does n't work .
this movie pretty much sucked . i 'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible . if your in the military and you see this movie you 'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad . it was ridiculous . they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do . it was a pretty gory movie i 'd have to say the least . there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump . i 'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent , gory movie . it will be a better movie also if your not in the military . i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one .
i though this would be an okay movie , since i like zombies and horror movies in general . but i did not think it would be such a piece of sh ! t like it was . the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car ! ! ! the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors , i would n't ever call them actors ! the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play . its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters . there is no fun at all in this piece of sh ! t , only horror , but not in the way the director intended . i would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again ! ! ! ugh !
star rating : * * * * * the works * * * * just misses the mark * * * that little bit in between * * lagging behind * the pits in this debut effort for nick park 's beloved man and dog , they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese . as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes , this w/g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows . the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here , sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box . admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is , i 've never actually been hugely into wallace & gromit ( maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation . ) the only one i 've really enjoyed is the wrong trousers ( and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of , shall we say , the seedier pleasures of life . ) i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation . as technically impressive as the first two ( all things considered ! ) this one lacks the emotional angle it 's successors were to possess . that being said , it 's fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come . two stars , but a good two stars . * *
not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short , this thing exists for one reason , to have a lesbian three-way . there are worse reasons to exist . one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie . misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character , like lara croft , that they make nude calenders of her , you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode . unfortunately , this is pretty pathetic . especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty , where you can see her hand is fingering air . watch this if you just ca n't get enough of misty or ruby , who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever .
this was longer than the ten commandments , all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined . my oh my , what a nightmare . this is the single biggest over-hype of 2006 . there is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd . movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer . dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture , in the form of endless music montages , shoddy acting , and poor directing choices ( seriously , mr. condon , did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots ? it 's at # 58 ! no wait , look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again .... and again .... and again )
jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires , aliens and the quest for immortality . the women are beautiful and the photography stunning . the dialog is inane . its a laughable mess . great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful . i 'm trying to figure out if we 're suppose to be scared or not . at the same time is it a put on or not ? its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to `` mean '' anything , and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle . something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women .
this tear-teaser , written by steve martin himself , is so unbelievably bad , it makes you sick to your stomach ! the plot is pathetic , the acting awful , and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending . avoid at all costs !
i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it . well , i ca n't imagine anyone liking this movie because it 's just bad , bad , bad . it 's obvious that whoever made this movie does n't know a single thing about horror . the whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres : action movie ( guns and criminals ) and horror ( living scarecrows ) . when the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows , the two genres automatically cancel each other out because , first , they 're criminals and who cares about criminals , and second , because they 're stupid criminals to boot ! having zombie scarecrows go after them just does n't work here . where 's the horror in that ? i wanted the criminals to die horrible , painful deaths . but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres , which could have been original if handle well , never gels . we 're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows , which are `` alive '' for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up . making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible ( tv like ) and , worse offense of all , whole bunches of the dialogue are told on cbs , and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over disconnected images as if we 're watching some sort of radio show . this part was really bad . the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea ! i ca n't tell you how annoying that was . as i 've already mentioned , the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid . for instance , when someone suddenly shows up , gutted and filled with money and straw ( yep , straw ) in his huge open wound , the others ask `` what drug is he on ? '' after they shoot tons of bullets in him , unable to kill him ( he 's been `` zombiefied '' by the scarecrows . do n't ask ... ) . get a freaking clue , morons . i 've never seen such stupid people in a movie . and then there 's the girl . i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt . when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow `` cross '' , she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene ( bad acting ) , even though the criminals could n't have done it . what a dimwit she was ! but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick . they 're not scary . nothing much is explained about them . they 're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie . mr wesley , filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds nonstop does n't elicit anything but sheer boredom . and that scene with the talking head in the fridge . thanks for the laughter . all in all , this had to be one of the worst movies i 've seen recently ( and i 've seen a lot of movies these days ! ) between the equally woeful silo killer or scarecrows , i 'd rather watcher silo killer again . yep , scarecrows is that bad .
a quite usual trashy italo-western , stupid storyline full of clichés and lack of logic , some mediocre actors , dirty settings , lots of punch-fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale . this has nothing to do with django . - at least not in my german translated version , this german dvd-release is called `` adios companeros '' and has macho callaghan fighting against butch cassidy and ironhead because their gang killed his one ( he 's the only survivor ) . then you have butch cassidy and ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split . and you have ironhead fighting against everyone because he 's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway . yeah , that 's it , no more cleverness in the storyline , hehe . a small role by klaus kinski as reverend cotton is remarkable ( that 's why i bought this dvd ) . in one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming `` i said love ! '' and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second - fantasticfantasticfantastic ! ! ! it 's also remarkable that joe d'amato aka aristide massaccesi did the cinematography - i love this master of incompetent exploitation-thrash , so it was an `` aahhh '' for me .
this movie was so terrible it was almost good ... almost . we love musicals , but not this one . even with the terrible sound quality , poor cinematography , and many actors who ca n't sing or dance , anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance ( especially toward the end ) . the character marjorie , a drunk lady , was enjoyable to watch , too . the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music . admittadly , some of the songs ( fantabulous ) are pretty catchy ( but not in a good way ) . open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful ! we think it might be a good stage musical ( with excellent actors ) .
this movie starts out promisingly , with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary cooper 's marriage to his daughter , anita louise . frank morgan , playing an unabashed gold-digger , loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter , anita louise . i am a fan of all 3 actors . frank morgan is ( to my mind ) a hollywood treasure , cooper a legend , and louise a very lovely , versatile and under-appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role . i also have nothing against teresa wright , and while not blessed with great range , she usually delivers heart-warming performances . from a promising opening , the story slides downhill all the way to the end . i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper 's would-be in-laws . the butler in such a fastidious , non-smoking household would never just blithely walk away , allowing cooper to continue smoking , or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill-timed cigarette . moreover , nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it . and finally , nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket ! this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche . it is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter . the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived . nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent ! that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it 's absurd ! stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense , and that , too , is nothing to laugh about . finally , the scenes of cooper 's overly fastidious , neurotic attention to his baby 's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies . but to me they just seem tedious and slow . the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes , while paradoxically , the script writer went to sleep . the lines are just not in the script to generate humor . they just miss on all cylinders . the laughs come not a mile-a-minute , but more like a light year-a-minute . the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera . the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper 's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together . there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine , but none of it was extracted . in the end , one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt . predictably , it is the anita louise character , who gets jilted on her would-be-wedding night ! while it is not on camera , that is her fate , and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end . she had n't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic ( unlike gail patrick , say , in my favorite wife ) . consequently , i was expecting ( perhaps `` hoping '' is a better word in the context of the film ! ) for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending , too . the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie 's end really undermines the effect of the `` happy ending '' for cooper and wright . i kept waiting for something to happen , for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era ... and it never delivered . a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here .
william hurt scuba diving scientist ? ? ? us agents running the investigation abroad ? the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away ? sniper missing and not killing hurt ( just wounding him ) but the second `` kill '' shot is dead on ? waste of time . to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous . oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the `` evil '' agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the `` virus handshake '' . what ? btw ... when did imdb require 10 lines of text ? i 'm just babbling here . does n't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines ?
but , lets face it ... it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me . the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups . i get a new season , and just power through them like i have 2-days to live . i like the idea of wrapping it up , but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following : dr.cox is n't supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes , only explanation i can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning . and that my friends , is why the hell cox is bald . anyways , the show is awesome ... bring on the 7th season .
this movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie . first of all , the casting could have been better ; katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom . also , the plot was pathedic . it was extremely cliché and predictable . the ending was very disappointing and cheesy . ( but thats all i 'll say about that ) . the nail in the bag though , was a scene when katelyn ( jordan hinson ) was supposed to be crying , but the girl could n't cry on command ! there were no tears streaming down her face , just a few unbelievable sobs . she is not a dynamic actress at all . she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire ( sp ? ) . thats when the movie went from not-so-good , to just plain bad . it really looked like she was acting . in a nutshell : this movie was really bad ! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990 's that everyone 's sick of -- only worse ! i give it an ' f ' , because it was just so darn hard to sit through ( b/t/w , i was babysitting when i saw it ) . however , you may like it if your 9 or under . ; )
a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father ( ray milland ) . syrupy , sugary , and most of all , sappy story about a battle of the 'classes ' when rich-kid ryan o'neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule . ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout-catholic father , but no one in the film is more annoying than o'neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as harvard 's champion yuppie . followed 8 ( ! ) years later by 'oliver 's story ' .
cassavetes was clearly an intelligent , sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films . he wanted to be an auteur , to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the american cinema . for that , i applaud him . unfortunately , as a member of his audience , i can not applaud a woman under the influence . cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic ( an insane woman ) and somehow managed to craft a dull film , filled with lengthy , ad-libbed ranting and drawn-out scenes . he seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person 's life on film , and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real -- or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not . yet i found the performances , particularly rowlands ' , to be artificial . i never believed for a moment that she was really insane . i have met people who are truly mentally disturbed , yet i 've never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in a woman under the influence . she played it like a very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drinks a lot , and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once ( at the beginning ) , but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film . there are some moments in which she taps into something real , but those moments are few and far between ; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . again , i applaud her efforts , but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true . novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly , just to prove that they 'get it . ' but do n't be brainwashed by the hype -- judge for yourself . you do n't have to pretend to like it . like woody allen , john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film-making , seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he could n't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent . but woody allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained -- he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . if cassavetes had employed some self-discipline ( and a sharp pair of editing shears ! ) , a woman under the influence could have stood a chance . but what 's the point of making a 'realistic ' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art-house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti-establishment deity ? without dumbing anything down , i believe cassavetes could have made a woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot , instead of presenting a string of 30 minute-long scenes of ad-libbed arguments . if you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans , you 're just reaching the already converted . watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it . if you are truly moved and fascinated by it , good for you .
great cgi effects & a truly oscar-worthy performance by gary sinise as lt. dan . tom hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie , how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime . this movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation , with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice , beginning from forrest 's service in vietnam all the way through to the `` resolution '' with jenny at the end . with that said , though , it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through . i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive , zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make . watch this film and ask yourself `` what is robert zemeckis saying about what makes a good american ? '' forrest seems to have made the `` right '' choices and been at the `` right place at the right time '' for the last 45 years . those who are wrong according to the director 's vision seem to pay a heavy price . so is zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic , even american quality ?
have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots ? no ? me , neither . well , i 've finally seen one in `` spring in my hometown , '' and i must confess , now i know why people do n't do this . the technique is `` arty , '' to be sure , but it 's definitely not ripe for public consumption . the technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters , and perhaps that might be the director 's whole intentions . i do n't know , i ca n't read minds , and i certainly do n't know enough about the director to make a judgement . but one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-american sentiments . as an american , i 'm well aware of my country 's participation in the korean war , and i 'm very well aware that we were n't always angels , but i 'll be damn if i 'll take this guy 's version of how things happened . according to this blind fool , americans were not only at the root of the war , we were the cause of the war , and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country . whatever , mister director . and i suppose you 'd still be making this film in communist korea if we had n't interfered , right ? talk about forgetting your history . this is almost akin to making the nazis the `` good guys '' while turning the allied forces into the `` bad guys . '' this movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it 's almost embarrassing to watch . for a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to american interference , he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental .
unfortunately , this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original . nicholas cage , fairly wooden as far as actors go , imbues the screen with a range of skill from , non-plussed to over the top . the supporting cast is no better . the plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse . not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold . it turns out it 's just a bill of poor goods . disbelief can not be suspended , nor can a befit of a doubt be given . the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual , as the medium requires , and whomever scouted the location should be commended . there was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos , literally , at the end . disappointed ! wait for the original to come on television , pour a whiskey and enjoy .
this movie made me feel as if i had missed some important scenes from the very beginning . there were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started . i was very disappointed because i love whoopi goldberg & danny glover , in addition to that have always trusted & respected danny glovers taste in his choice of roles , `` grand canyon '' for example . i just could not finish this movie , after what seemed an eternity , but was probably just a little over an hour ; we had to turn it off . there was no comedy , there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them , there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited , confusing , and unnecessary . what could have been a great idea for a movie , even as a drama & not a comedy ( although i think a comedy in this situation would have been better , because i love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots , it makes me laugh ) became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store .
* spoiler warning * first of all i rated this movie 2 out of 10 . the idea is good , but there are too many stupid errors in the movie , failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . first of all she never fights alone . after an initial very strange doubt from her mother ( which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie ) the rape victim is not alone . she is also unbelievably naive always falling into the crew 's strange traps . her friends are unbelievably nasty . the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . ethan is very much the leader of the crew ( hey , they even say so ) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk , but when ethan changes his opinion he just does n't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . everyone just simply hates him ... why ? ? the movie provides no explanation . how did he ever become the leader ? a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in . two actors from the same successful tv-series .... a cheap way to get viewers ?
after harry reems ' teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt ( the night-walker ) , reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians . meanwhile , colt , who carries a cane and dresses like a magician , rapes some more women . eventually , reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree . despite being shot on film and marginally nasty , it looks like any other 70 's porno and is ineptly executed . the rape/abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on `` death wish '' is laughable . r. bolla ( `` cannibal holocaust '' ) plays a cop . colt , who is usually over-the-top , wigs out in a couple of scenes , but he 's too well behaved for my money . this roughie could have been much rougher .
parasomnia has an interesting premises , but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach . the cast in unconvincing , even patrick kilpatrick , who played great roles in movies like scanner cop 2 , open fire , under siege 2 and eraser . the rest of the cast is unknown ( and not very good ) with the exception of jeffrey combs . ( herbert west from the great re-animator trilogy ) . but he can play roles like this in his sleep ( which is a little what he does here ) . the main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all . the story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory scenes , especially at the end . this could have been so much better , i do not get the good reviews on this one . it is below average really .
second-tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western  which , having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine ( though featuring a nice enough score ) . the plot offers some mild interest : the title , incidentally , refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun-runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer , cavalry agent madison . the latter 's younger siblings are determined that the injured party , now in their charge , lead them to the gang boss responsible ; ultimately , the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both , ironically , become involved with one of madison 's sisters ( another is raped during the raid ) . euro-cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess , and madison 's ex-flame .
the humor in who 's your daddy is such poor taste that i actually closed my eyes in certain scenes . close ups of semen are not funny ! nobody thinks they are . people get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness , they laugh . watching who 's your daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling .
with a title `` borrowed '' from werner herzog and liberal helpings of kubrick , haneke and noe it is painfully obvious that thomas clay considers himself a cut above the usual sort of rubbish our british cinema churns out . `` robert carmichael '' ( for short ) sets itself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the iraq war . the problem with the realism is that the characters are so patently unrealistic and atypical - contrary to the fetid imaginings of `` extreme '' filmmakers most teenagers are not drug addled rapists . as a critique of the iraq war , a film about youth violence ( by a talented classical musician - subtext society has damaged this sensitive individual ) is so infantile as to hardly bear thinking about . there are signs of technical ability but some reviewers have overstated this . like kubrick and noe he does show that the desire to shock linked with supposed serious intent may be the worst cinematic con trick of recent film . people liked `` clockwork orange '' and `` irreversible '' because they liked the rapes and the violence , but most of all they liked feeling culturally superior for liking things that most hated . so too much kubrick and not enough haneke ( a serious and moral filmmaker ) here labels this as one of the most moronic films in years . ( i am not against violence in film . to do it seriously is a hard trick though - people in cinemas cheered alex in `` clockwork orange '' showing how kubrick 's supposed intent was missed by miles . gratuitous violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the pretensions of many art-film directors . )
please do n't rent or even think about buying this movie.they do n't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $ 1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know.ginger lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna & she 's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the time.this movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time .
i may not have the longest of attention-spans , but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through , and i even bought it on dvd because of its `` classic '' status . at first , i thought that the director was playing a big joke , so i kept waiting for a resolution , something to laugh at , something to keep my interest , but this resolution never came . rather , the writing was laughably amateurish , the movie dragged on and felt disjointed , like someone cut a tv series to feature-length . the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight oscars . once again , i repeat myself . this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through . the first was `` exterminator '' . i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is . 1/10
trifling romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie ( kay lenz ) and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years ( william holden , surprisingly affable within this highly-concocted arrangement ) . the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages ; still , the scenario is such a middle-aged cliché by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile . it may have worked much better with different leads : holden and lenz do n't match up well ( her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her ) , making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable . dated , blurry-romantic , and mostly unmemorable . * * from * * * *
deathstalker is perfect for b-fantasy movie fans ; this barely 80-minute travesty of film-making features everything hecklers can ask for -- non-existent plotting , terrible acting ( save for at least a raspy-sounding old lady ) , laughable scripting and schlock editing , and bargain-basement style background settings . there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting ( in particular , the lead does n't have anything appealing about him ) , and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the f-grade material . if that 's not enough , then how about the lack of a compelling plot ( which this movie has nothing of the sort ) to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey ? i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 ) be topless and/or scantily clad ; 2 ) get raped ; 3 ) have sex with the hero ; 4 ) all of the above . in addition , the background music is hideous ; a bizarre mess of electronic noise , cheesy choral bursts , and blaring orchestral cacophony . ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested , deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at ( and believe me , there 's plenty of that in here ) . otherwise , i do not recommend this 100th-grade conan wanna-be to anyone in the least .
this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . i 'm not kidding . the next time it comes on , i will just continually run my head into a wall . it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again . i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again . they are both good comedians , so i was shocked this was so awkward . if they had to do it all over again , i 'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it . the folks that fronted the money , must have lost a ton . not really- because the special effects ( all 2 of them ) were terrible .
i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie . it 's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply ca n't suspend disbelief . the problem starts early , when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle , overlooking the capitol building in washington , d.c. that kind of life on a government salary ? hah ! it only gets worse . toward the end , when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys , the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die , in order to cleanse the gene pool . the special effects are pretty good - any producer 's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films , but the screenplay and direction here are moronic . many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven 's previous , facially stupid movies ( showgirls , starship troopers ) , but this movie should stop the wondering . he 's just plain bad .
this movie forever left an impression on me . i watched it as a freshman in high school and was home alone that night . i think i lost all respect for robert reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the `` brady bunch '' . i also thought the role of chuck connor was horrendous and evil . however , this movie made such an impact on me that i am now a volunteer in the women 's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives , one at a time . what fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie . none of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when i discuss this movie because they did n't see it .
bonfires of the vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat . i can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous , provocative and important , yet failed so consistently across the board . it is like a stand up comic who 's not getting laughs , but ca n't leave the stage . the harder the film tries , the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud . the desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved . the film achieves laugh-out-loud status only twice . once is in the sight of geraldo rivera playing an obnoxious , arrogant and amoral tv tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently does n't realize he is playing himself . the other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film 's final `` big moment , '' wherein the judge played by morgan freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is ( `` it 's what your mama taught ya ! '' ) . the pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd . yet , one must admit it is a noble effort . it does have a good , if poorly cast , band of actors , who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures . the film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director brian depalma just loves are apparent , if not particularly effective . but the film , which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics , never arises above the level of cartoon . satire requires style . farce requires energy . even sitcom requires timing . but the best bonfires can muster is desperation . in the end , you do n't want to laugh , you just want to turn away .
this is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks . first thing , what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school ? i think the kids does n't seem to realize the gravity of the situation . deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line . where is the responsibility there ? i understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity . oh yea and none of them knows how to aim . the stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy . they all want to look professional but they all suck . one more thing i do n't believe that there 's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked . what happens if there 's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead ? it is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school . anyway there 's a lot more to say but it would be too long . i spent some time of my life to watch a crap .
i can not vote on this because i would n't watch garbage from these people . they got my money with another movie ( mr. jingles ) and i swore it would never happen again . i feel it 's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash . go to the forums on this film and read where cast members try to act like they are seeing the movie for the first time . one guy even responds to himself ... using the same name ! there are shills in the forum that say it 's as good as shawshank redemption and citizen kane ... not even close ( by no means ) . if this is the company 's 2nd movie , it should be better than the first . that means the 3rd movie should be a lot better . not so , i 've seen it . all i want to know is how you distribute this trash using the same names all the time . having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine ... but do n't try to market that trash !
i really , really wanted to like julian po . i think that slater is underrated as an actor , and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film . i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read . so , i do not know if what i see as the film 's faults originated with the story , or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter . the premise is wonderful , and i loved the voiceover , confessional tone the opening narration strikes . but then ... ? nothing ! several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide . one could argue that he does n't answer , because it 's none of their business . but julian is the one who , under only token pressure , blurted out his intentions in public . then neither julian nor the director/writer , despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god 's sake , seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian 's life . he says he was a bookkeeper . he says his family moved around when he was a child , due to his father 's job . so what ? there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian 's purpose . but none of them go anywhere , because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet , as if he were the ultimate ( and only ) sane one among them . this might work as an allegory , if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart . the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive , religious wife of the mechanic . and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian . i can only see the julian character -- as rendered -- as selfish , petty , and totally condescending . sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked , contrived film . and poor michael parks , an actor who once had so much promise , is given nothing to work with here .
this is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie . i highly recommend the prophecy , but this movie was a dud from the start . the acting was decent all the way around , but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional . a 4 out of 10 at best .
by all the fawning people have been doing over miike and his work . i sat through this flick tonight . i figured , if it 's half as good as ringu , as i assumed from these comments it might be , than it will be worth my time . no such luck . i 'm all for finding the next great director ( or writer ) , but i do n't think miike is the one . i do n't have an nyu masters of fine arts , but i do know this much : a horror movie has to have pacing . it also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does . this film 's pacing had me shaking my head . some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly , i went to the fridge and lingered there while kou shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end , eyes wide and mouth agape . a famous director once made the claim , and i 'm paraphrasing , a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll . kou is not a good enough actress to make that work . she stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than i care to remember . and she is n't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights ; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance . the script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time . i like asian cinema . hong kong action flicks from the last 30 years , korean horror like `` phone '' and `` koma '' , ang lee 's work , some of the trashy but fun filipino movies with gratuitous sex and fighting , as well as others . chakushin ari i could have done without .
ok .... i just have 3 words - cheesy , cheesy and cheesy ! the only redeeming feature of this movie is dean cain . other than that - it 's cheeseball supreme ! ! ! ! the movie does have some promise in the concept - an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically giving us more of `` jurassic park '' meets `` reign of fire '' ..... there are some great possibilities , but they just do n't follow through .... the special effects are decent - even though you know the dragon is cgi , it does n't horribly look like cgi .... i would n't lay the blame on dean cain ( although he is one of the producers ) , i 'd lay more of the blame on phillip roth - the director and writer . it 's his job to make this film .... and , unfortunately , he failed .
this is probably the first entry in the `` lance o'leary/nurse keat '' detective series ; in subsequent o'leary films , he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee . a group of relatives ( all played by well-known character actors ) gathers in an old house ( on a rainy nite , of course ! ) to speak to a wealthy relative , who goes into a coma . while they wait for him to recover , all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen , including a couple of murders . a creepy film ; worth seeing !
this movie can be labeled as a study case . it 's not just the fact that it denotes an unhealthy and non-artistic lust for anything that might be termed as caco-imagery . the author lives with the impression that his sanctimonious revolt against some generic and childishly termed social ills ( `` moldavia is the most pauper region of europe '' , `` i do n't believe one iota in the birds flu '' , `` romanian people steal because they are poor ; europeans steal because they are thieves '' ) are more or less close to a responsible moral and artistic attitude - but he is sorely off-target ! what daneliuc does n't know , is that it 's not enough to pose as a righteous person - you also need a modicum of professionalism , talent and intelligence to transpose this stance into an artistic product . fatefully , `` the foreign legion '' shows as much acumen as a family video with uncle gogu drunkenly wetting himself in front of the guests . the script is chaotic and incoherent , randomly bustling together sundry half-subjects , in an illiterate attempt to suggest some kind of a story . the direction is pathetically dilettante - the so-called `` director '' is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene , his shots are annoyingly awkward , and any sense of storytelling shines by total absence . ( of course , any comment is forced to stop at this level ; it would be ridiculous to mention concepts as `` cinematographic language '' , `` means of expression '' or `` style '' ) . the acting is positively `` cântarea româniei '' ( `` romania 's chant '' ) level , with the exception of ... paradoxically , the soccer goal-keeper necula raducanu , who is very natural , and nicodim ungureanu . oana piecnita seems to have a genuine freshness , but she is compromised by the amateurish directions given by daneliuc . the most serious side of this offense to decent cinema is the fact that the production received a hefty financing from the national budget , via c.n.c . ( the national cinematography council ) . the fact that long-time-dead old dinosaurs like daneliuc are still thirsty for the government udder is understandable ( in a market-driven economy , they would be instantly eliminated through natural selection ) . but the corruption of the so-called `` jury '' that squanders the country 's money on such ridiculously scabrous non-art , non-cinema and non-culture belongs to the criminal field .
the animation in this re-imagining of peter & the wolf is excellent , but at 29 minutes , the film is sleep inducing . they should have called it `` peter & the snails '' , because everything moves at a snail 's pace . i could n't even watch the film in one sitting - i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time , and it was pure torture . save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me . i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees . unfortunately , to vote for the winner in the best animated short ( short ! ) category , the voters will have to sit through the whole thing . i already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there 's no way this film will come close to winning .
a major disappointment . this was one of the best uk crime drama / detective shows from the 90 's which developed the fascinating title character played by scotland 's robbie coltrane . however this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus . coltrane is n't really given much to do , much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer , and in what he has to act in , he seems uninvolved , almost bored . the ex-soldier 's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on coltrane 's family life seems lightweight . perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth . as is , skip this and watch the old cracker from the 90 's which is far far superior .
i am a huge charlton heston fan . he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time , but what was he thinking when he made this movie . normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director , but in this case it 's all him . the suckiness of this movie is all his fault . it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting . i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and i 'll never get that time back . this is by far the worst heston movie that i 've ever seen . if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you 'll find this movie entertaining , but if you 're not do n't waste your time , you 'll regret it in the long run .
this movie really has no beginning or end . and it 's really very unbelievable . mary-k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company . but , for some reason , they 're put up in a 5-star hotel ( conveniently located across the street from the coliseum ) , and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are . one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins does n't end up with the guy . i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit . nice try .
when i saw the previews for this movie , i did n't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie . but wow , this movie was absolutely awful . and that 's being generous . first of all , the casting for the movie was terrible . you feel no sympathy ( or for that matter any morbid feeling ) for the characters . the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to end . secondly , there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever . can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming `` pancakes ! ! ! '' at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i 've never seen before , and even further biting the guy who has the virus ? why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy , and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ? i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud , `` where the hell did that come from ? '' i just simply could n't believe what i had seen . i really thought i had seen some bad movies , but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all . this movie made me want to puke and then puke again . then blow my brains out . please , save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive . watching grass grow , perhaps , is a proper alternative .
this film has little to recommend it , though that little being the breathtaking scenery , cinematography and direction of wildlife , it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews . it is precisely these things , however , that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing . i watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end . yes , the pictures were great , the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent , but what was going on in the foreground ? the rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing . it is certainly not a new story , in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told , and we have all seen this before , and , indeed , much more eloquently by antoine de saint-exupéry . the only thing really to be gleaned from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting ; the rest is a waste of time .
i remember this movie when i was 13 ( seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing age 13 ! ) with a group of school buddies . we all wanted to see billy crystal in his first movie , and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy . we suffered through about 45 minutes of it , and all agreed to leave the theater . it was grotesque & tasteless , and a far cry from the ability billy crystal had to make us laugh , we were not laughing . i stumbled upon this review by accident , and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot-gut waste of film this was , now if you rent this , you deserve what you get , you 've been warned ! !
watching it now it 's still as skanky and sexist as i remember . comes from a time when girls were `` dolly birds '' and basically men 's playthings . it 's hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact it 's available on dvd when good films are not . our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse ! trouble is you ca n't help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus . try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy ? blue `` saucy '' nightie or something similar like shirley bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972 . warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus , which i 've been informed is not a routemaster but a bristol . look just do n't bother watch something decent instead like porridge or dad 's army ... or a fly crawling up a wall .
hollow point is an alright movie worth a half price rental or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no thought required . there are the requisite explosions and hammy acting and pretty ladies . a pretty good cast with donald sutherland , john lithgow , and the lovely tia carrere . this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one .. on a scale of one to ten .. a 4
you ca n't really go far when the initial story is n't all that great . the premise of cyborg 's needing blood is just dopey . the script is blasé ' . the actors do n't have much to work with . the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs . it 's a trademark that if the background is the desert , then the movie has no budget . lack of budget is okay , if there 's a story . `` solarbabies '' and `` blood of champions '' are examples of decent work from no $ . but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich . again , forgivable if only the story did n't just plain suck . finally , this movie commits the biggest crime of all : it does n't finish ! it simply ends as if it 's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie . but the rest never comes . just odd . just bad .
in this movie , chávez supporters ( either venezuelan and not-venezuelan ) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country . they did not say that the conflict started because of chávez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues . they did not say anything about more than 96 tv interruptions transmitted by chávez during only 3 days in `` cadena nacional '' ( a kind of confiscation o private tv signals ) . each one with about 20 minutes of duration . they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero , inspector general of the army forces , who is a traditional supporter of chávez . even now , in despite of his announcement , he is the ministro de interior y justicia . after chávez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa ( equals to defense secretary in us ) . they did not say anything about chávez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections . they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by chávez supporters ( either civilians and military official forces ) . they present some facts in a wrong order , in order to lie . they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and chávez actions in order to avoid the elections . that 's why i tell you .... this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie .
this is absolutely the worst trash i have ever seen . when i saw it in the theater ( arghhh ! ) , it took 15 full minutes before i realized that what i was seeing was the feature , not a sick joke !
what is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing . it 's top of the line from first national in these departments . the story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of miller 's other two films ( sunny , sally ) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval , complications and final clinch . all the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy . miller sings parts of i think of baby and reprises because of you . there are also do n't ever be blue and though you 're not the first one . miller here is very engaging and delightful , quite reminiscent of irene dunne in manner and delivery . sad she does not dance as that is her forte . sally remains her finest film , with this trailing as second and the rather poor sunny a vastly inferior runner up . her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable . it 's worth visiting these films though to see ziegfeld 's top star of the twenties .
woody harrelson and wesley snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court . okay , that sounds all right there . it leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story . but no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film . this movie became redundant , retarded , and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by . woody harrelson played one of my favorite t.v . characters , woody from cheers , and i was looking forward to seeing him in this movie . but after seeing his `` acting performance `` i have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend . his acting was as dull and poor as the movie . another actor in this unreal film was rosie perez . i have liked movies with perez before , but i have decided that the reason i have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and did n't have that many speaking lines ( do the right thing ) . but now in white men ca n't jump she was made a central character with many lines , thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice . so after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing rosie perez for much more than appreciated i can now say that i 'm a white man and i 'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story apartment building .
this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal . or as i should say steven so-dull ! like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines , leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped . a few films before this was he has done this too , but i do n't think to this extent ! to be honest the film looks pretty good , the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie ! of course , all told , this film is pretty bad . it would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself . do n't bother . anything over a buck for this one is too much ! i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film . what 's taken me so long to realize this ? !
loc could have been a very well made movie on how the kargil war was fought ; it had the locations , the budget , and the skill to have been india 's `` saving private ryan '' or `` black hawk down '' . instead it come across as a bloated , 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie . even the war scenes were terribly executed , using the same hill in all their battle scenes , and spending unnecessary time on casual talk . instead of trying to appeal to the indian public , a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at kargil ( like `` black hawk down '' ) or even spending time on the militant point of view ( like `` tora , tora , tora '' ) . even better , it could have used a competent director like ram gopal verma to write , direct and edit the film . until then , i 'd like to see some one re-edit this film , with only the pertinent portions included ; it would make the movie more watchable .
i remembered the title so well . to me , it was a flora robson movie with olivier and vivien leigh in supporting roles . and it had vincent massey 's voice from behind whiskers . well flora robson was great . her next signature , for me , would be `` 55 days at peking '' . the same role but with different sumptuous gowns . and the same voice . as for the armada , it was a subtext . i like black-and-white films . was everything done in elizbethan times at night ? it was talky and difficult to fathom , at times . i could n't tell which was the love interest . was it the spaniard or was it vivien leigh ? and i do not believe that elizabeth i would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the armada . apparently it worked for the empire , but not for the script . this might have been more accurate , historically , but bette davis had more engaging scripts . and i missed daylight !
absolutely unwatchable , lowest quality film making . this film makes `` show girls '' look good . the acting is insufferable . the cinematography gives a bad name to amateurism . no wonder it went right to video and bypassed the theaters . this film was n't released ... it escaped .
`` whipped '' is one of the most awful films of all time . it is a mean , hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 , besides maybe `` the grinch . '' it is not , as people have called it , an insightful portrait of modern relationships . that would be a little film called `` high fidelity . '' whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic , `` whipped '' is hostile , cynical , misanthropic cinematic poison . avoid this like so many plagues , unless you want to see how truly bad a `` comedy '' can get .
i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000 . thankfully , mike , crow , and tom servo are watchable , because the film itself is not . although there is a plot , a story one can follow , and a few actors that can act , there is n't anything else . the movie was so boring , i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom , crow and mike . as summarized above , however , it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that preceded it ; mitchell .
after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film ( russ conway ) , i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed . a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life . unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses , in contrast , a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull . a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end . if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep , this will help you to sleep that sleep .
okay . who was it ? who gave revolver 10 out of 10 ? are you tripping of your head on ecstasy pipes ? there were so many of you . did you do it for a dare ? is this some kind of cult ? or did guy richie himself sign up 788 times under different names ? before i say anything else , i 'll say this . just because you do n't understand a film does n't mean that it 's not great . maybe you 've had a bad day at work , or you sat down to watch a film after you had a row with your wife and then were n't in the mood . maybe there 's a more fundamental stumbling block- like you just do n't have the mental capacity or a highly enough developed philosophical sense to engage with it . but . and this is a very , very big but . the xxl elephant-sized mega-but to end all buts . please do n't confuse incoherence for complexity , and please do n't confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting film . really . you may think you are pretty smart . you may even think of yourself as somewhat of a romantic figure : an independent thinker championing a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers . please do n't . you 're embarrassing yourself . revolver 's a waste of everyone 's time . if you thought about if for a few minutes , you 'd recognise it too . it was a waste of the cast , a waste of the crew , a waste of the caterers , and definitely a waste of the precious minutes ( you ca n't get them back you know ) of anyone unlucky enough to sit through this unutterable , wretched mess . `` no - wait , '' comes a voice in the darkness . `` you just do n't understand . its non-linear . that means the story does n't go in a straight line . this is actually the complex and subtle work of an auteur . it addresses difficult existential questions . and anyway - they slated fight club when it first came out - did n't you hear ? -because they could n't deal with the complexity . they 're eating humble pie now . bet you hate lynch films too , doncha ? '' hate to disappoint you , but i am quite a big lynch fan . i rather like memento , so a narrative told in an unconventional fashion does n't necessarily fill me with fear . and although i 've only studied it briefly a few years ago , philosophy interests me greatly . i do n't dislike revolver for these reasons . i dislike it because it purports to be about weighty , big-brained topics but deals with them in such an insultingly superficial way as to be laughable . i 'm not much of a chess player , but richie 's idea of how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four year old . i dislike it because the characters , without exception , totally alienated me . `` aha ! '' cries the richie apologist . `` guy is cleverly tipping his hat to brecht ! '' just maybe you 're right . i think its more likely that he just ca n't write a decent script for toffee . comparing revolver with fight club is actually really instructive . fight club has acid-tongued , nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh . revolver has stale fortune cookie reject one-liners that make your ears bleed . fight club has a great twist that makes you reassess everything that has happened . revolver has , as far as i can tell , several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because ... well , they do n't make sense . if you keep pulling the rug out from under people , they eventually kick you out of their house . and then they lock all the doors and windows . and they never let you back in . ever . guy richie seems to assume that being philosophical entails repeating a mantra of little buzz-phrases . mostly they are spoken , but often they flash up on the screen with attributions . it 's almost pathological . but what makes this film particularly notable is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be married so neatly with all tired gangster clichés in the world . ultimately its so inconsequential . you do n't care about anything . you do n't understand anything . you go home . actually , there was a bit i really liked : the uptight assassin who has a crisis of confidence . he 's great . but i ca n't recommend you see the film just to see him . he 's only in it for a few minutes . please believe me . it 's horrible .
for a comedic writer , woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development . there are a few entertaining moments , but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls . will ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery . amanda peet did well , but again , did n't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie . the movie is so heavy and dull that it can not be carried but if it were carried , radha mitchell did it . if you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and do n't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion , then you 'll love this movie .
i have a feeling that dr. dolittle was intended for an audience composed entirely of children . i think i would have had a better time if i sat at home and watched a sit-com . my favorite characters in the movie were the pet hamster and the two alley mice .
this was awful . andie macdowell is a terrible actress . so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job . but then remember that turn in four weddings , equally as excruciating . another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages , and village greens . i mean that school , how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that ? the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat ( a nauseating british series set in the 60s ) .this film just could n't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women 's friendships . if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked ( i say just ) . but those scenes just did n't work with the tragedy in the second half . i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour . a final note- what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo ? not to mention anna chancellor . macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream .
kill me later '' has an interesting initial premise : a suicidal woman ( selma blair ) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber ( max beesley ) who promises to `` kill her later . '' the actual execution of this premise , however , falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion . shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around . lack of character depth especially diminishes selma blair 's performance , whose character shawn vacillates from being morose to acting `` cool '' and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt . this is unfortunate , as under other circumstances ms. blair is an appealing and capable actress . compounding matters for the worse is director dana lustig 's insistence on using rapid cuts , incongruous special effects ( e.g . look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end ) , and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the mtv crowd . certainly ms. lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction , but in no way does her skill help overcome the film 's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end . clearly , lustig has a distinct visual style ; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film . the producers ( ram bergman & lustig ) can be commended for their ability to realize this film : they were able to scare up $ 1.5 million to finance the film , secure a good cast , and get domestic and foreign distribution . this is no small feat for an independent film . yet given the quality of the product , the result is a mixed bag .
the thing that stands out in my mind in this film ( sadly ) is the introduction , where john berlin ( andy garcia ) is driving into town . you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees . it 's quite beautiful . as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin , well ... andy is just too hispanic/latin for it to be passable . maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story ? who knows . but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks , he stands out like a sore thumb , especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry . yeah , i know , big deal right ? he 's still a good actor . the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer . all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them . the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness ( do n't ask ) appears , helena robertson ( uma thurman ) . thurman does a good job of playing a blind person , to my surprise . when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt . freddy ross i got worried . henriksen 's played in some pretty strange films , especially of late . i still ca n't forget him in the bloodbath movie , pumpkinhead . berlin movies into a small town from l.a. as a detective . he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill . his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far-fetched . so did the irony of * spoiler * freddy 's murder , with the recording and name similarities . i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight `` jennifers '' . and the motive of the killer as simply deranged did n't pack much of a punch . in retrospect , this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons . john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia ! albeit no cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out . as to the ending , it is a bit of a surprise , but is highly arguable , much like sgt . ross ' murder . the killer chooses to walk after his running victim , opting instead to frolick i guess . and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it 's ridiculous . i wo n't ruin the very end because despite it 's shakiness , it 's a good surprise . afterward though , you 'll probably say , as i did , `` boy was she lucky ! '' 4/10
i think i 've seen worse films , so i 'm giving this a 3 , but it 's a struggle to remember what they could have been ! ! possibly xtro ( nasty & dull ) or possibly creep ( just plain dull ) , but it is a struggle to think of something worse . it 's difficult to know where to start . let 's just say it 's a poor man 's under siege , starring an even poorer man 's jean claude van damme . the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien - i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers . yes , he was johnny rico , if you really want to know . judging from this site , he 's been stuck in tv movie hell .... casper , be more selective .... please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! arghhhhh , i 've just turned over and there 's a half decent film on called criminal law ...... now i 'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1.5hrs ! ! !
need i say -- its a stinker ! ( i gave it a rating of 2 ) only watch it if you suffer from insomnia . there 's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up , but not much else happens in this movie . there is no suspense , no deep , shocking secrets revealed , no real threat to the heroine 's well being . a few disagreements , slight raising of voices -- that 's pretty much it . the secrets are nothing that could n't happen to anybody - the last `` secret '' revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point . the plot , such as it is , revolves around a young woman named faith ( meg tilly ) , who is an artist , who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very , very wealthy , older widowed woman , and a growing mother/daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her . it turns out the older woman 's daughter , cassandra , is dead . you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together . even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two . why he 's still hanging around years after cassandra 's death is a good question . there 's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant , a faithful butler who seems to do everything -- cooking , cleaning , serving the meal , answering the door , etc . everything except apparently locking the door -- since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is . there 's nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms , and leaning forward on the edge of your seat , because there is no `` mounting '' tension in this film -- just bland , pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time .
did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads . like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks , next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider , next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes . i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work . i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie . i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie . if , however , you find his work/not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one .
oh dear ! the first time i heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot `` johny test '' while we were playing video games . i thought he was confusing `` johny quest '' ( by the way , one of the best cartoons i 've ever seen in my life '' , and changing the `` quest '' with `` test '' . its something weird that i 'm wrong , but actually i was wrong , he was n't changing nothing , he heard of this show . one day , while watching tv , i heard that cartoon network was going to be released . i was n't sure of what was the plot of this show , so i adventured myself to watch it , and here is my answer `` i want my damn hour back '' ( because i watched this crap and `` my gym partner 's a monkey '' . this is one of the worst shows i 've ever seen . first , the beginning , with the most stupid song in the world , then the plot . oh , where are my manners ? i have n't said the plot of this show . is about a boy who has to amazingly intelligent sisters , that have a lab and make experiments with their own brother . ohhh , now i see why his name is johny test , he is the test of his sisters experiments . you know , i honestly miss dexter 's lab ( before it was transformed to the new dexter , a total crap too ) . this is a bad copy of that old good show , except that this show is amazingly bad . do n't watch it , make something more productive in that half-hour than watch this crap .
many people like to point to this tv movie when arguing with the vast legions of hanks-philes out there that tom did in fact make crappy films ( i think `` bachelor party '' was great , but that 's another story ) . the movie focuses on a `` dungeons and dragons-style game '' that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness . the story is charmingly early 1980s , focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role-playing games . i , however , prefer to view `` mazes and monsters '' as the turning point in the `` whatever happened to chris makepeace ? '' story . we all remember him as 'rudy the rabbit ' in `` meatballs '' and as the hapless clifford in `` my bodyguard '' , where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of matt dillon . few could argue ( especially those of us who read `` dynamite ! '' on a regular basis ) that great things were in store for him . and then came rona jaffe . the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin , so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace 's performance in this is . all i know is that the last major release i saw him in was `` vamp '' , and that was 1986 . he had a small role as sean penn 's brother in `` falcon and the snowman '' , but by that time the brat pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes . i ca n't in good conscience recommend this movie . watch it if only to see a younger , more idealistic chris makepeace , before rona jaffe feasted on his soul .
roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on . all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family . this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better . as much as i did n't like `` barracuda '' ( that 's on the same dvd ) i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane . eye candy : one pair of tits ( they might belong to kirsten baker ) my grade : f dark sky dvd extras : vintage ads for various drive-in food ; and trailers for `` bonnie 's kids '' ( features nudity ) , `` the centerfold girls '' , `` part-time wife '' ( features nudity ) , `` psychic killer '' , & `` eaten alive '' . the dvd also comes with 1978 's `` barracuda ''
this is indeed a god adaptation of jane austen 's novel . compared with the american version with guinneth paltrow , the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book . but the acting was awful . besides kate beckinsale , who i believe was a true likeness of the emma in the book , all the other actors were trying too hard . mark strong was not the `` gentleman '' he was supposed to be . he was often rude and offensive , had no feeling whatsoever , and throughout the entire film you could not see his love `` growing '' for emma at all . this had a terrible effect on kate beckinsale , who seemed to be trying to `` resque '' her leading role as well as her partner 's . moreover , there was no chemistry between the entire cast . hariett smith , played by samantha morton , seemed to have no real attachment to mr. elton , played by dominic rowan . therefore , she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book . the settings of the film are also too poor . the costumes are even more so . i would have imagined emma woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here . the ending is also too long . it is good that it resembles the book 's ending , but it is a killer ending for a film . and again , i can see no feeling of happiness in the face of mr.knightley . to conclude , i believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book , but with poor actors . it seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all . i would prefer to see the `` lighter '' version with paltrow and northam , even if it is clear that it was made to be a `` blockbuster '' , than to watch these actors ( excepting the good olivia williams and the better kate beckinsale ) ruin the entire script .
i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy . attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides , this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off . the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshall 's sentimental direction and mark andrus ' dark , rather confusing screenplay . the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel , who have driven all the way from san francisco to small-town hull , idaho where grandmother georgia lives . the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgia 's taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion . the set-up is clear enough , but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline . it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism , child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution . the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees . probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker 's voice , lindsay lohan makes rachel 's promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable , although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior . felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant , resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry , alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter 's state of mind . she does what she can with the role on both fronts , but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being . at close to seventy , jane fonda looks great , even as weather-beaten as she is here , and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty georgia . the problem i have with fonda 's casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares . between this and 2005 's execrable monster-in-law , it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her . it should come as no surprise that the actresses ' male counterparts are completely overshadowed . garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve harlan , a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint . cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lilly 's husband , an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie 's ending . there is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower , lilly 's former flame and rachel 's new boss as town veterinarian dr. simon ward . laurie metcalf has a barely-there role as simon 's sister paula , while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos . some of andrus ' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right . there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd , none all too exciting . marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor . there are several deleted scenes , including three variations on the ending , and a gag reel . a seven-minute making-of featurette is included , as well as the original theatrical trailer , a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to marshall .
it would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie-ready ' as `` the house next door '' to be adapted for film or television . the book was copyrighted in 1978 . one reason could be problems designing 'the house ' . the house in this lifetime film is really so ugly that i ca n't imagine anyone buying it . in fact it 's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built . i 'm not crazy about horror genre books , but this one was hard to put down when i came across it around ten years ago . the main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life , and this is one of the book 's strengths . they are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon .. ( or the devil personified ) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book . however , it is a downbeat book for the most part , and i do n't think that appeals to the people who run lifetime . maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come . a better house .. better music .. a better screenplay and darker lighting ... would certainly help .
the soloist has all ingredients to impress the academy . its director , joe wright , has already authored a best picture candidate . the leading actor , robert downey jr. , starred in a widely praised superhero film . finally , the movie itself is a drama . when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 , filmgoers and critics were baffled . now that i 've seen it , i assure you universal did n't just delay this film to promote iron man-oscar buzz . the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates . downey and co-star jamie fox are n't to be blamed for this mishap . joe wright is largely at fault but even he ca n't save a lifetime story . many movies are too complex and alienate viewers . this one is unusually simple . it 's a movie about a newspaper reporter , steve lopez ( downey ) , who befriends a homeless musician , nathaniel ayers ( jamie fox ) . that 's it . ayers is schizophrenic and does n't resonate with lopez 's traditional approach to friendship . the two become friends . they begin this movie as acquaintances and are bffs by its end . tension consists of moments like this : will ayers let lopez take him to the homeless shelter ? this material would have been better suited as a made-for-tv production rather than a feature film . wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content . lopez battles yard-defiling raccoons in what i consider a sub-plot . do you remember when this happened in atonement or pride and prejudice ? those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged . ayers ' back story is fleshed out when it does n't need to be . worst of all , these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals . it 's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal . nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing ( i was too ) . this is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with ayers when most of us already have it . he 's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud ! the movie somewhat conveys humanity 's love for music , like amadeus and beethoven lives upstairs . it is n't as effective as either of those pictures , however . the entire film is hinged on ayers ' schizophrenia . it ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else . his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including . the film does n't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona . take music out of amadeus or beethoven lives upstairs , and no film remains . the soloist is more about friendship in general than music . nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered . this is only joe wright 's third film , and his first that is n't a romance staring keira knightley . let 's hope this film is n't an indication of how limited his abilities are . there are stylistic nods to his earlier works but the soloist is much weaker than either of them . in his defense , universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture . this film seems tailored for imagine entertainment ( distributors of changeling ) . i would n't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release . its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally .
people like me will tear this movie apart . it 's just not realistic . the plot is sooooooo predictable . you can anticipate everything that happens convientantly of course , they find the treasure and become filthy rich , and trick the bad guy . we 've seen it a million times before . the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid . they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film . i mean solving riddles in a matter of seconds . the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway ? you 'd think with all the work that 's gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before . and all that was constructed during the civil war ? please and the love story between ben and abigail ? ? how cute , and i thought the romance in clive cussler novels was weak . they just fall in love like that , in 2 seconds whatever i 'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some . the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper . 1/10 garbage
i do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view , nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception , it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie . beginning on halloween night 1968 , 6 year old michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister . michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again . from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable . the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing michael ( the murderer ) is exactly the same throughout the movie , thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow . for the horror/thriller enthusiast , there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although i am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age . a happier medium could have been found . from a half hour into the movie , not one scene is unexpected . the acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast . a positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere . a second positive would be the character of michael 's doctor , who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead . however , it is clear that the star , in jamie-lee curtis , is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim . it is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day , but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent , the 90s , it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film . i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s . cheers !
considering john doe apparently inspired kyle xy 's creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting . however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it . first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience , in a public area . so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment . but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced . they focused too much on john doe which made the story far less intriguing . i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell 's performance because i found he did n't make a believable john doe . an other problem was the police story . it really felt like déjà vu and it was n't a pleasant sensation . it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch , the episodic format . i could already see the fillers coming one after an other . so overall i was very disappointed by it and do n't recommend it to anyone . considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled . in some way i have the impression that it missed its target , developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity . it 's sad because there was potential , like the people he met at the club . the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct . but i 'll never know if it got better , probably not , because i do n't plan to watch the next episode .
in theory , films should be a form of entertainment . while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film-making ; most movies , specially genre films , must not only tell it 's story or message , they must entertain their target audience in some way . all this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low-budget , a bad movie is one that is boring . `` hellborn '' or `` asylum of the damned '' as is known in the u.s. , is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving , and irremediably boring and tiresome . while it has a very good premise , it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does n't make things better . on another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic b-movie , but here it is just a bad attempt at film-making . director philip j. jones tells the tale of james bishop ( matt stasi ) , a young psychiatry resident , who just got his dream job at st. andrew mental hospital ; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret . after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices , james decides to find out what is going on ; only to find the incredulity of his boss , dr. mccort ( bruce payne ) , who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients . while the premise is quite interesting , the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired . in an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller , jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every cliché of the genre . of course , there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés ; but in `` hellborn '' every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving , resulting in a boring and predictable storyline . the acting is quite mediocre for the most part , with one big exception : bruce payne gives a top-notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting . matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances . despite all this flaws , one thing has to be written about `` hellborn '' ; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big-budget hollywod `` horror '' productions . also , the make-up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good . sadly , the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated , making a huge contrast with the make-up & prosthetics . `` hellborn '' is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results . hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience . 3/10
the movie opens with a flashback to doddsville county high school on april fool 's day . a group of students play a prank on class nerd marty . when they are punished for playing said prank , they follow up with a bigger prank which ( par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds ) goes ridiculously awry leaving marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough . fast forward five years , where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion . we find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene , as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious , jester mask-clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind-numbingly ludicrous fashions . it does n't take sherlock holmes to solve the mystery of the killer 's identity , as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario . the film takes a turn for the bizarre as marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors , only to be haunted by their ghosts . marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life . finally , the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as marty wakes up in a hospital bed , breaks free of his restraints , stabs a nurse , and finally disfigures his own face . the script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic . the only originality comes from the mind-numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched . the absurd it-was-all-a-dream ending feels tacked on . it 's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream . technically speaking , the film is atrocious . some scenes were filmed so dark that i had to pause the film and play with the color on my television . the acting is sub-par , even for slasher films . i ca n't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray , which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable . their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them ca n't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie . all of this being said , if you like bad horror movies , you might like this one , too . it is n't the worst film of the genre , but it 's far from the best .
american pie has gone a long distance from the first . at first i believe the actors do n't have a clue what their doing and instead it 's just a remake of a college party gone nuts . story sets out as two freshman college guys ( featuring the young stifler ) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties , sex and of course the booze . the plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie . in fact they did n't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film . luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free . but please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking . i 'm a teen myself and i believe even evan almighty would 've been a better choice instead .
when this film plays on television you might want to save about 90 minutes of your time and change the channel . there 's nothing special here that you need to see . story is about two married couples from arkansas who go on a trip together to reno . couple number one is lonnie earl dodd ( billy bob thornton ) who is a car dealer and having problems with his marriage . his wife is darlene ( natasha richardson ) and she has a low self opinion of herself and they have n't been intimate in a long time . lonnie has been sleeping with candy ( charlize theron ) who is the wife of his best friend roy kirkendall ( patrick swayze ) . they all drive to reno and the four of them stay in one luxurious suite . roy and candy have been trying to have a baby and finally candy discovers that she is pregnant . but roy phones his doctor in arkansas and finds out that he 's sterile . candy and lonnie admit their affair and now the whole trip is in chaos . this film is directed by jordan brady and he 's made a few other low budget films but this is his first with a cast this impressive . unfortunately brady does n't show much comedic flair but you ca n't lay all the blame on him . this script is just not funny and one of the glaring problems is that the characters are all written down to a sitcom level . just because they 're all from the south does n't mean that they have to be naive and idiotic . thornton 's character does n't have the sophistication to tip the bellboy more than a dollar . and swayze 's character is called stupid and dumb by everyone throughout the film and one of the rare good moments comes when he asks everyone to lay off of him for at least one day . penelope cruz pops up as a prostitute and it 's a totally worthless and pointless cameo . she barely speaks more than 3 or 4 lines ! i think she was fulfilling an obligation to harvey and bob weinstein who are executive producers for this film . the only person who actually is n't to bad is richardson . we watch her become more confident in herself but this plotline in the film is very obvious and cliche . all of these actors should know better and it 's hard to figure that they all read the script and liked it . it 's a complete waste of time for these actors but at least they got paid . as for the viewers , your not getting paid so skip this one !
where do you begin with a movie as bad as this ? do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes ? the over-the-top acting ? the dreadful script ? no . you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at . i know i do . i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire ( usually a bad sign if a preview copy is n't available to the quality movie mags ) . however , cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer is n't happy with the finished product . i went three days after it opened with two other mates . the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own . and that was on cheap night . either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is . not since the days of the avengers ( 1998 ) have i felt so short changed since watching a movie . if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it . tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set ; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage ; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance , rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary . mind you , considering she used to be in the word , any viewers ' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with . the production values are n't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious . if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say `` fak ! '' for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street . otherwise , bargepoles required .
run ... do not walk away from this movie ! ! ! ! ! aimed at the very young kids , this movie will bore you to tears . if the gamera trilogy of the 90 's raised the bar , this film just lowered it . it 's slow paced and the monster fighting is good , but seldom seen . this movie had me dry heaving in the cat box . just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90 's series . spoilers beyond this point ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! here are the top 10 reasons gamera fans of the 90 's series will hate this film . 10 . this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die . 9 . you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film . he gets his butt kicked by a few gyaos and self destructs ? ? ? he looks old and lethargic . plus he looks nothing like any gamera you 've ever seen . his suit looked cheap and rushed . 8 . the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon . big-eyed and cute ... it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs mechagodzilla 2 . gamera is now too cute . 7 . this movie has the pace of watching a nascar race during a 3 hour rain delay . i watched this movie with 2 other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along . i 've seen an suv full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster . 6 . like godzilla : final wars , this movie had very little kaiju time on screen . final wars had much more , actually , and better fights although short . 5 . kids take the title role . the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the 1970 's and history repeats itself in the 2000 's . the most successful gamera films abandoned the sesame street feel and went to a darker place . why go back to a failed formula ? this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue ( thank god ) . 4 . gamera lost his iconic roar . he now sounds like an elephant with strep throat . 3 . this movie may produce a new olympic event ..... imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm 's way . you have to see the ending to understand this point . where were the parents ? oh yea .. right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone . 2 . the special effects were good , but sub-par for a gamera movie . legion and iris had better effects . the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly . not too impressive . 1 . this movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect . the director was involved in power rangers and it shows . it comes off like a cross between et , always : sunset on third street and tmnt . kudos if you know all 3 references . rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series .
why oh why ca n't anyone make a decent film out of a legendary tale ? this is the second adaptation of `` beowulf '' i 've been disappointed with in a year . but i have to say , the previous version ( `` beowulf & grendel '' , starring gerald butler ) was far superior to this . that one was only a little disappointing . this one is a mess ! ! ! what bugged me most ? was it the useless plot elements they added in for no particular reason ( human sacrifices ? pointless love interest ? ) , or the bad cgi , or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting ? even worse was the way they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible ! ! ! and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ? and why did they continually remind us that beowulf had the strength of 30 men , and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the entire film . he was tossed around by both monsters he fought , relying on his sidekicks to save his bacon . even when he slugged the arrogant prince , he did n't knock him out . he was much too reliant on weapons . beo-wimp is more like it . this was certainly not the powerful beowulf of the epic poem ! i 'd like to end this on a positive note but i ca n't really think of one offhand . all i can say is , if you 've ever read `` beowulf '' , you 'll be infinitely disappointed by this dismal , inaccurate excuse for an adaptation !
vijay krishna acharya 's 'tashan ' is a over-hyped , stylized , product . sure its a one of the most stylish films , but when it comes to content , even the masses will reject this one . why ? the films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby . script is king , without a good script even the greatest director of all-time can not do anything . tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'yash raj films ' and mega stars appearing in it . but nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . thumbs down ! performances : anil kapoor , is a veteran actor . but how could he okay a role like this ? akshay kumar is great actor , in fact he 's the sole saving grace . kareena kapoor has never looked so hot . she looks stunning and leaves you , all stand up . saif ali khan does n't get his due in here . sanjay mishra , manoj phawa and yashpal sharma are wasted . 'tashan ' is a boring film . the films failure at the box office , should you keep away .
saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970 's and hated , hated , hated it ! easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life . do n't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate . the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie , just long , long silences with people unable to articulate what they are ( presumably ) feeling . if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you . if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster : the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this ! yes , leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss .
wow this is the worst movie ever . the only reason i signed up for imdb was so i could complain about this movie . i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a dvd but i almost stopped this one ( and i should have ) . but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending . wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up . i 've never seen the first one and will never after watching this . its terrible acting with a terrible plot . hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out . and the sad part is that when this movie came to dvd it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever . so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk .
bamboo house of dolls ( 1973 , 1974 or 1977 , various years are given for this title ) is a hong kong veteran chin hung kuei 's ( killer snakes , boxer 's omen , payment in blood etc . ) women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers . yes , even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this , and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre , even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films ! the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized , abused and raped by the bad japanese ( what else ? ) during the world war ii . the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan ( shaw veteran lo lieh ) is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell . what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity , female kung fu , some nasty torture , gore , sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that does n't even try to be more than it is . there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls . the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that 's about it in the merits department . the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other . the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds , misogynistic torture scenes ( for example , one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc . ) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it . of course it is stupid to talk about `` moral '' when writing about this kind of film , but still there are elements i wo n't accept to be found from any film . the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure ! for example , the gold box , filled with heavy gold , seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls do n't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it , not to speak of throwing it ! also those numerous `` skin fight scenes '' make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema . i have seen the same director 's killer snakes ( 1973 ) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real , it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society . also , it is a must for those who fear snakes . bamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship , too , which is n't a surprise considered the subject matter . the uncut version , ( dubbed into a non-english language ) released in europe at least in france , italy and switzerland , runs 104 pal minutes while the cut , english dubbed print released in holland , belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal . from what i 've heard , the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and `` plot development '' and the like . bamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i would n't have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general . some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous , calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation . 2/10
this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made . it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006 . i 've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie . it should n't be that obvious . i ca n't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this . if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie , it is gone for sure now . i 've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i ca n't understand how that is even possible .
this show had pretty good stories , but bad dialog . the main character was especially annoying . it 's quite obvious why this show was canceled , although , like most upn shows , i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re-runs . most of it 's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies , leading me to think the producers did n't have an original idea in their heads . i have n't commented enough . you 've got to have at least ten lines of text . the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show . the gnome was a nice character .
only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars . i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film . in this sequel , cruella devil ( by the way glen close pulls off this role very well ) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour . she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away . from that point , we only wait until she starts having crises . soon enough , she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world , of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur . apart from glen close , i found all cast quite silly but from a child 's eye funny . that is fair enough as its target market is , i assume , children under 12 . quite a good entertainment for children and families , but did n't do much for me . * out of * * * * *
well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie , and it was n't even worth that . it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain , i am guessing . neagle - despite her glory , awards , and reputation - is a homely british gal who ca n't sing or dance or act . some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic . director herbert wilcox ( neagle 's husband ) always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen . he was mistaken . she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii . her `` serious '' roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here . only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented . skip this one and find the one that stars doris day . at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing !
pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series , strung together without the usual commercials . the story is typical of pokemon ( conflict , fighting , and a resolution where all are happy in the end ) , and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation . some of the holes in the plot are filled in ( over the closing credits ! ) without explanation , and everything is just a bit too sweet . why see it on the big screen ? the only reason is to be a part of your child 's world . both of my sons enjoy pokemon , and by my showing an interest in what they like , we are closer . seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube , and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience . i gave the movie a 4 , mostly from my children 's point of view .
dreadful acting . a thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle . women are subjugated and revolve around men . tom selleck shows his acting range from a to b .
what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres , i thought i have to get the other movies this guy ( larroz ) has made , i was sorry i tracked this down , it is a weak attempt at an occult/satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex ( with ugly actors and actresses , this is an excuse for sleaze . the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere , avoid this one , too much hype surrounds it , not worth the effort of finding it , this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition . i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres , oh and the goat scene was very boring , i understand that this is what carries the hype .
you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie ? well this was beyond that . i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like $ 3.00 and i 'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at . it is really nothing short of pathetic . about 30 minutes into the movie , my friends started asking me to turn it off . around 45 minutes they begged me . after an hour , we compromised to fast forward to the end , so we could see how the conflict was resolved ( and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh ) . seriously , do n't watch this movie . it is beyond painful .
it was n't good . the characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories i had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new ' personalities ( or lack thereof ) . i seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by ariel because of how absurd it was . it was serious . it just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the disney channel-everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection . the most disappointing part was the horrible songs-not catchy , not amazing . in the original ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun . you remember them and want to sing them . but the songs in this movie were n't creative in the least ; it 's as if they 're talking in a annoying sing-song voice-quite weakly , disappointing . i do n't have that want-to-sing-them feeling you normally get from a disney movie . it 's as if not one wanted to do this movie , so they barely made an effort . . . this movie would needs a new story line , new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying `` look at me ! look at me ! i 'm so annoying ! '' mentality of this generation of disney . : ' (
everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! my grandma could have done better than that ! but that 's not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( it 's actually so bad that i 'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) if the first episode of les visiteurs ' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . clavier is over-acting his role even more than in the first part , robin is trying to act like lemercier ( because she 's replacing her ) but that 's grotesque ' . lemercier is lemercier , robin is robin ! even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she 's not acting as she used to act . i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( lemercier obtained a césar award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played lemercier playing her role ' ! as for the story , it 's just too much ! of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poiré and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . the gags are repetitive , childish and déjà-vu . no , really , there 's no more than 3 funny parts in this . the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . so you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment ' ! 2/10
made one year before ilsa , she-wolf of the ss , blacksnake could have easily been called susan , she-wolf of the plantation and it probably inspired the producers behind the nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical : a gorgeous , horny , head strong ( but stupid ) blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control , whom all hate her and want her dead . sounds familiar ? director russ meyer and david friedman , the producer behind the ilsa flicks , are good friends and they started their careers together . so , obviously , there 's a connection there . looking at blacksnake , i ca n't help but think that russ meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because xxx movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s , and russ meyer films , though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence , were never even close to real porn . his films started to look positively quaint next to deep throat and other hard-core porno blockbusters . meyer knew he could n't compete with such films and blacksnake is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career . he obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory . but blacksnake bombed at the b.o . and meyer quickly returned to making vixen type of films that , even if they still were n't pornographic , they were most definitely more over-the-top than any of his previous films . it 's no wonder blacksnake was a b.o . failure . it 's just terrible . trash-o-rama . jaw-droppingly bad . it 's a quasi-campy take on slavery , if you can imagine that . the end result is jarring . one minute , we 're in typical meyer territory : exuberant , playful and silly , and then the next minute , super serious meditation on slavery and violence . huh ? it just does n't work . the slavery/racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category . but blacksnake is not as sleazy as ilsa she wolf of the ss and those kind of films , so i imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it , which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or russ meyer fans . meyer blames the failure of blacksnake because , and i quote , `` it did n't have enough breasts in it . '' well , i 'm sorry russ , but the film is just bad , breast or no breasts . but he 's right though about the low breast quota . except for anouska and the maid , the film 's cast is male . meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs , in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big david ( darth vader ) prowse . and with anouska 's right hand man around , who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men , one can only wonder what meyer was really trying to create here . blacksnake stars david warbeck , who is lusted after by anouska and her right hand man . poor david . he looks totally befuddled by the whole experience . he did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that , at times , he has no idea what 's going on . and then there 's anouska hempel . she 's a beautiful woman ... for the 1970s , not the 1870s . with her makeup and hair , she looks like a typical 1970s brit pin-up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix . and her wardrobe is hilarious . at one time , she actually unzips her leather boots ! i did n't know they had zippers in those days . but the character she plays is , in itself , really degrading ( no pun intended ) . she 's nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men ( and that woman ) on the island . for example , one night , when david and anouska are getting it on , her annoying slave driver walks in the room , knocks david unconscious and tries to rape her , groping her savagely . the next day , the slave driver is still working for anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened . it 's totally ludicrous . under any circumstance , had her character been a real person , anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island . or even killed him . but the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters ' credulity to the max . ridiculous details like this , and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes blacksnake a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie . watchable in the train wreck variety . i just could n't help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all ( the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch ) . so , this being an exploitation film , i guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do . but blacksnake is mainly for russ meyer completists .
boring children 's fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do . sappy kids pursue their dreams . frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player ( yuk ) while best-friend hazel runs for mayor -- -she 's 13 ! totally pedestrian in every way , plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys . certainly a lesser effort for showtime -- -no limits ?
honestly , who in god 's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating ? ? i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted . otherwise this movie sucks ! this movie is nothing more than an amateur , or possibly student , film . i 'm a movie fanatic , and have seen terrible movies , but there was literally nothing redeeming here . the story and acting was the worst i 've ever seen . the props , including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects , where just as bad as everything else . i 'm all for bad language in movies , but the f-bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f-bomb in any movie ever . the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film . i 'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country , but it does n't belong on a dvd . do not buy this movie . do not rent this movie . all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon . this is valuable time that you will never get back . unfortunately for me , that time is lost , but it 's not too late for you . if you decide to rent this movie , consider this my warning .
the goofy griswalds win the t.v . game show `` pig in a poke '' grand prize , and all fly off together to europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another . of all the ridiculous , unfunny money-spinning sequels this one beats the lot . harold ramis ' 1983 film was a below average misadventure in which the misfit family went on a nightmarish `` vacation '' across the states . this time amy heckerling ( `` look who 's talking '' ) helms what turns out to be a disastrous `` comedy '' which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh . hughes script ( with rob klane ) is awful and you wonder why the likes of chevy chase and beverly d'angelo bothered with such a dead-beat project , as even anthony michael hall and imogene coca had the sense to decline the offer . even an omnipotent michael palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining . yet , as inconceivable as it may seem , `` european vacation '' was successful enough to warrant a second sequel ! surely it could n't be as unbearable as this one . you know , i have yet to see a national lampoon show that was worth the bother . monday , december 26 , 1994 - t.v .
yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation . as with juno and the paycock , you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie . there is almost no style or craft to it at all . the story revolves around fred and emily , a young married couple , who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage . emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted , wealthy man who falls in love with her , but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband . this might seem more believable if fred were n't made out to be a completely insensitive , pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman . the couple ends up staying together , but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene . the third act goes in a completely different direction , with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat . joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband . that 's about all you can say for this one .
some have praised _atlantis : _the_lost_empire_ as a disney adventure for adults . i do n't think so -- at least not for thinking adults . this script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . the `` crack staff '' of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think _the dirty dozen_ ) but _atlantis_ represents one of the worse films in that motif . the characters are weak . even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . an md/medicine man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix-and-match quirks before . the story about how one companion , vinny played by don novello ( fr . guido sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing . only the main character , milo thatch , a young atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by michael j . fox , has any depth to him . milo 's search for atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . the opening scene shows a much younger milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head . and while the characters were thin at best , the best part about _atlantis_ was the voice talent . perhaps milo 's depth is no thicker than fox 's charm . commander rourke loses nothing being voiced by james garner . although rourke is a pretty stock military type , garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . garner 's vocal performance is the high point . i 'm sorry to say leonard nimoy 's dying king is nothing more than obligatory . additionally , don novello as the demolition expert , vinny santorini , was also notable for one or two well-done , funny lines -- but i 've always liked father guido sarducci , anyway . also well done was the computer animation . the background animation , that is . the character animation has not been this bad for disney since the minimalism that drove don bluth out the door . the character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter . aside from landscapes , buildings and vehicles there is n't much to impress . the plot was the worst . some say hackneyed or trite . i 'm not so sure about that . any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment . shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint . so the treatment is the thing . and _atlantis_ obviously lacks that . i can not begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section . the plot was bad . the plot 's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense . to add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness . * * spoilers * * 1 . right at the beginning when milo reveals that runic or celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the `` coast of ireland '' should read the `` coast of iceland '' , we begin to have problems . the writers of the script would need to know the british take for eire or eireann as `` ireland '' , and completely ignore the older , latin term hibernia . but more than this , they need to know of the vikings conspiracy to call the greener island iceland and the icier island greenland . by making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated `` letter '' , the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of english and a post-roman date on the script . since this is long after atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave . and without visible clues and less technology than milo had , made the inscription far less trustworthy . 2 . the shepard 's journal could not be written before the sinking of atlantis , or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying `` in the king 's eye '' . it must have been written after the sinking , but without even the technology that milo 's expedition had , how the heck did anybody get by the leviathan . so how could it know more about anything after that ? and why would it be written in atlantian ? automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things . however clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in atlantian . so it 's got to be some sort automatic writing . since noone left in atlantis can read , it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface . this would have made more sense . but could also have been explained within the movie : milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life -- appeared in dreams , etc . this needed to be explored in the movie . 3 . the atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages . no-one expects that the original indo-europeans would be able to converse in europe , anymore than romans would understand that hard `` c '' s or their day became french `` ch '' s ( pronounced like `` sh '' s , no less ! ) 4 . current atlantians were alive before the cataclysm -- when apparently they * could * read , yet now are unable to read what they used to , or operate similar machinery . 5 . the mass illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie . nothing seems to have happened to this culture . it seems suspended in air until milo can rescue it . even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival , no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused atlantis to fall into illiteracy . 5 . kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity set in -- but any of it * * hardly * * qualifies her father for deification ! ! kashakim 's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence . killed a bunch in the cataclysm , stalled progress ( not a lot killed here , but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody , if they were n't boiled in lava first because the giant robots were n't there to protect them . a bolt of blue electricity should have shattered kashakim 's likeness , when kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of great kings of atlantis ! 6 . even though milo was the only one who could read atlantian , rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal -- which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or `` phases of the sun '' diagram . 7 . if milo 's grandfather had told rourke about it , it still does not explain what how rourke would have suffered from milo 's reading it as part of the book . ripping out the page -- which was dog-eared in rourke 's hand , even though milo found no sign of a torn page in the book apparently -- only was there to tip off the viewer that `` something was not quite right '' . unless the word `` crystal '' would have set alarms off in milo 's head that somebody would try to steal it , milo would have suspected nothing . it 's just thick-headed foreshadowing . 8 . the crew 's `` double-cross '' was not a character change . we learned that vinny , sweet , audrey and cookie had been going along with rourke from the beginning . however , the `` change of heart '' falls flat . it was a change , and needed to be better motivated . hard to do with characters who were n't given anything to begin with . 9 . niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome , instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from . it 's liquid ; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas . 10 . the ending stinks ! -- and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness . with it 's powersource restored , atlantis is no longer a weak power , needing coddling . the giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might . the technology is superior to ours , and definitely to early 20th-century . in the end milo needs to teach the atlantians to read , for what ? the whole idea is to leave their little quiet , chastened culture alone , not to send it into hyperdrive . * * end spoilers * * perhaps , the lost world plot and the turn-of-the-century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps . the failures i find with the film agree with this idea . but i am at a loss why i should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well . and pulp stories is part of the `` crap they ca n't sell adults anymore '' , anyway . we have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well . raiders of the lost ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness . 4 out of 10 -- the movie is enjoyable but as i think about the plot , it seeps ever lower .
there is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this film . it was straight up trash . at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack ( burlap ) of fail ! the fighting is barely martial , the acting is teetering on the edge of par , and the music is not worth describing . there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made . the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak , and did nothing but frustrate me . i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using yumiko shaku .
i have no idea what on earth , or beyond , could have possibly made sam mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake . ben & arthur is one of the worst movies ever made . in fact , i see no reason why it should not be at # 1 on the bottom 100 . for although i have not seen , for example , superbabies : baby geniuses 2 ( # 5 at the time of this publication ) , i would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound , because even in its vapid dismalness at least baby geniuses 2 was professionally made . by contrast , everything , and i do mean everything , in this film is completely unprofessional . the movie is intended to be an attack on the christian right 's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays . and i do emphasize `` intended . '' not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose , it also leaves an ugly scar . instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple 's struggle against a society that largely opposes them , it creates tired , crass stereotypes of each party involved . ben and arthur , the namesake couple , are portrayed as two crude , sex-starved , and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so . this meets with the opposition of ben 's brother victor , a christian minister who , like all christians ( as this movie would have us believe ) , is loud , prying , stupid , and violent . he tries to kill ben and arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry . just like in real life . and if you think that 's dreadful ( it is ) , you have n't seen it all . the actors ( ? ) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a youtube home comedy video . but not even daniel day-lewis and marlon brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker , for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie . every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote . for example , in one scene , victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother 's homosexuality . but instead of portraying this idea clearly , he spits out the stupid , utterly confusing , whiny-sounding line , `` you know what , i 'm never going to have any nieces or nephews , okay , because you 're so f * * * ed up ! '' even more glaring is the complete lack of production values . yes , i know this ai n't the dark knight , but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing . for example , six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds . people do not teleport across a room between takes . and objects do not fall forward when shot ! do not waste your money on ben & arthur . i do n't care if you 're 7 , 17 , or 107 . i do n't care if you 're gay , straight , bi , or undecided . i do n't care if you 're `` just curious . '' i do n't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung-heap . stay away , far away . this movie 's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a frisbee .
i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas . having reserved a special slot for it last night , i sat down to watch it with my daughter ( aged 17 and a film studies student ) , with chocolates of course , in eager anticipation . we love jane austin . after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk . the shaky camera shots and angles , general poor cinematography , direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied . despondent , we viewed on . anne , played by sally hawkins , looked oddly and with no particular purpose , directly at the camera on several occasions , breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment ' and engaging us directly in an almost ' i 'll find you ' stalking fashion . poor rupert penry-jones , who played captain wentworth , did his best with the script and direction , bless him . i hope they paid him well , however , as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall , drenching him and his co-actor . they were nearly swept out to sea . health and safety would have had a field day ! poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line . presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene . anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place . other than mr. penry-jones , alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head 's unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott . towards the long-awaited end of the film , captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie . it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being . in contrast , anne ran , hyper-ventilating , from pillar to post in search of the good captain who , in the meantime , had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told , in the course of only three or four minutes , without even having worked up a sweat . we experienced none of anne 's charms crossing the screen . indeed , we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain , spineless , opinion-less anne and why someone , anyone , did not tell mean , winging sir walter to just shut the heck up . the crucial kiss , normally our favourite girlie moment , was painfully drawn out . as they moved in closer , anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met . eww ! the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been . what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story , filmed in some of england 's finest scenery . sorry jane .
as others have said , `` no , luciano '' is a more apt title or response to this movie title . for entertainment , the great opera singer should stick to singing ..... not that he 's a terrible actor . it 's just that this movie stinks . the first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie , as it were - but after that it 's nothing but a boring soap opera . appropriately playing a singer , pavarotti , as `` giorgio fini , '' loses his voice a few times and the doctor , `` pamela taylor '' ( kathryn harrold ) comes to the rescue . the singer then falls for the doctor , the doctor slowly falls for the singer , the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes . pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy . it 's harrold that spoils things and after watching her here i am not surprised she did n't become a star . there is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy , good shots of san francisco and italy , at least in the first half of the film . i got bored and do n't remember much about the second half of it .
i found the documentary entitled fast , cheap , and out of control to be a fairly interesting documentary . the documentary contained four `` mini '' documentaries about four interesting men . each one of these men was extremely involved with his job , showing sheer love and enjoyment for one 's job . the sad part , i must say , would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked/studied . they were interesting for about five minutes , afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long . the video was filmed in a very creative way though . i very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another . it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music .
what a shame it is when a potentially captivating and refreshingly low-key story manages to latch onto your interest at the start and then gradually lets you down further and further until you 're left scratching your mystified head by the time it reaches its overdone conclusion . unfortunately , this is what happened to me by the end of white noise . it was n't michael keaton 's fault ; it was a pleasure to see him return as the star of a brand new movie once again , looking a bit wrinkled perhaps , but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance . as a man whose wife has recently died , he becomes obsessed with her wandering spirit in the afterlife ( not a new idea ) , apparently getting contacted by her through that funky electrical fuzz business you see on your television screen when there 's nothing being broadcast . the idea of spirits communicating via the airwaves is called evp ( electronic voice phenomena ) and there are a lot of people who actually believe in it for real , so i 'm not going to make any comments about what i think of that , or them . let me just say that i 'm all for suspension of disbelief when it comes to buying into fantastic films like this , but what i ca n't tolerate is not understanding what the hell was supposed to be taking place , which is about where i was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll . much static indeed . there are occasionally movies like this that have me completely baffled , but if a film fails to make itself clear for me , i tend to consider that to be the fault of the filmmaker , not my own ( unless i watched it while i was too tired to focus or something ) . well , for white noise i was wide awake , bright-eyed and bushy-tailed -- so guess who 's to blame ?
this is a good example of how not to make a film . there is very little meaningful dialog , no context for the events , and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes . the result is a confused , clueless viewer ; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director 's commentary . this movie has a lot to do with human atrocity and tries to show how wrong it is , with an emphasis on child abuse . it includes some stock footage of real , horrible acts of violence , including war time executions . although it works in the context of the movie , i feel that the ideas behind the movie could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content . this film is absolutely not for the weak stomached or the easily offended , and should not under any circumstances be shown to minors . the climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the movie . if you 're not listening to the commentary while it happens you will probably miss it . the director 's commentary was a one-shot , `` sit the guy down and let him talk , no cuts '' type of commentary . while this is n't necessarily bad , the director ends up rambling a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college , filming conditions , co producers , bad film , and a dozen other things . the constant negativity detracts from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the movie . the movie was shot many years ago on 16mm and super8 film over a period of four years on an extremely low budget . because of this , the video and audio quality is poor . that alone does not make it a bad movie , but it does make a bad movie worse .
i was willing to go with the original _cruel intentions._ it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories . however , this movie was , in my opinion , a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices . i did n't honestly care what happened to any of them . the strongest part of the original story ( les liasons , not ci ) is the characters and their interactions , not the events themselves . i was n't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel , especially since the title includes a number `` 2 , '' i expected a sequel , but then determined that it must be a companion piece . over all , i must say that this movie read , to me at least , like a soft porn version of les liasons . i was not impressed .
the nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet . it bears little resemblance to eta hoffman 's original story on which it is based . in the ballet , the story is essentially over by the second-half when clara ( or marie in this version ) travels to the kingdom of sweets to watch a series of character dances . there 's an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story in myriad ways ( not always successfully ) to compensate for the ballet 's weak libretto . balanchine 's version does n't really have any sense of drama or story at all ( despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in tchaikovsky 's wonderful first-act music ) . the result is a completely forgettable first-half christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing ( the little that there is of it ) is n't particularly memorable . the pantomime over-acting , particularly of drosselmeier , which might look passable on the stage , just looks silly filmed for the big screen . unfortunately , things are n't much better when we get to the kingdom of sweets ( act ii in the stage version ) . although there are a few choreographic highlights , most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring . this certainly is n't vintage balanchine . balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance , but i have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets . watching this film version of his stage production of the nutcracker has only re-affirmed this view .
i was n't expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j. furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got . a one-liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie - did n't seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film . on the other hand , i would n't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5.0 but hey , the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score , which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production . now i understand that the 37.5 % of people who rated this film a 10 ( excellent ) was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before , over and over . lundgren does not convince as an ex-military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school . his acting is just plain terrible , emotionless and contrived . lundgren 's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids . either they are great actors or , compared to lundgren , they seem great actors - just because they seem natural and believable . detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed-for-weekend high-security high school , four teens in detention with a war-veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story ( something like the breakfast club meets die hard , or is it panic room ? ) is full of unbelievable situations , lots of clichés and stereotypical characters . and let 's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor . alex karzis and kata dobó play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie , even if he seems a low-budget version of sam rockwell and she , a milla jovovich wanna-be . in a movie where everything fails , their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero .
i have n't seen `` henry fool '' , but after watching `` fay grim '' i 'm not sure i want to . maybe hartley aims to be the `` anti-thriller '' director -- -he sure succeeded with this yawner . based on the official description -- -woman discovers that her dead husband 's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security -- -i expected a taut geopolitical drama . instead i got flimsy structure , goofy dialog , flabby characterizations , a convoluted plot , and a `` tone '' that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time . i can hang for a long time with a frustrating , hard-to-follow plot ( e.g . `` duplicity '' ) because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together . even when they do n't , or they do but they leave lingering questions ( e.g . `` duplicity '' ) , sharp writing and acting can hold one 's interest . but half-way through `` fay grim '' i reached a deadly realization -- -i did n't know what was going on , and i did n't care . too bad , because i really like parker posey , reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent , estranged wife and indifferent , clueless mother to tough , shrewd international `` player '' capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists . there 's also bad casting . jeff goldblum can be very good , but he 's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative . he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it . his cia sidekick is worse ; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of `` american idol '' ( are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads ? ) . then there 's the sticky question of the characters ' ages . goldblum was 54 when he made `` fay grim '' ; thomas jay ryan , who plays `` henry fool '' , was 44 . neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages . yet , a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua `` back in the '70s . '' goldblum 's character would 've been in his 20s then ; henry fool would 've been a teenager . was hartley being `` quirky '' or lazy ? the problems are too numerous to list ...
must every good story be `` improved '' with added corny broadway music ? apparently those who ca n't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering . i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites , as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out , and this was a great example of just that ... so of course , take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it 's uplifting ? argh . fetch me a basin . the four stars in my rating come from casting , which i could liken to that of my fair lady . each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of , but then they must go and have them sing ( see complaint above ) . unlike my fair lady , those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed ( pardon if i 'm mistaken , it 's been a while ) . my biggest complaint i 've stated . why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story ? seldom has this been done to good effect . generally it ruins the story . it did with this one . jury 's still out on whether this story is worth saving , but with all that gadding about , it 's impossible to tell .
the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film , but i was truly disappointed . they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over , which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in , although beau bridges , as nick , did have a moment or two . if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . it was an embarrassment . i had been a fan since his waltons days , but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work , so poor was this offering . in defence of the actors , the directing was stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish . i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film . however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back , even though it was on t.v .
four eyed monsters follows the relationship of a shy , reclusive videographer and an equally estranged struggling artist , who , both living in the big apple , develop an unlikely romance with the help of an internet dating site . this in itself is not so unusual , but what is , is their method of communication . foregoing the verbal , they take to writing notes and later communicating through video . the film is based upon the creator 's ( arin crumley & susan buice ) own relationship , who besides writing and directing , take to acting as the lead characters as well . with elements of avant-garde , anti-plot , and docudrama , the film scatters itself to the wind with an undecided structure nestled neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence . as the movie wears on , a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grow old as the couple face the hardship of reality . focusing solely on inner conflict , or the woes of relationship , the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original , nor poignant . this could have been easily circumvented with the addition of subplot and external conflict , and a third act , to which there is none - just a montage of melodrama that leads nowhere . what is even more aggravating is the film 's descent from story into reality that abruptly concludes with an open ended and unsatisfying finish . this would have been all fine and dandy , but there is no question asked and no meaning to be discovered or pondered . ( on a side note , the film contains beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack , one of the more interesting aspects of the production . ) but as always , watch the film and decide for yourself .
oh , i heard so much good about this movie . went to see it with my best friend ( she 's female , i 'm male ) . now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream . after the first couple of dozen `` take off your clothes , '' we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom . we laughed ( at it , not with it ) , we dozed ( and would have been better off staying in bed ) , we were convinced we had spent money in vain . and we had . the plot was incoherent , and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care . a waste of money , a waste of celluloid . this movie does n't even deserve one out of ten votes , but that 's the lowest available . i 'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent ; i do n't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence .
what a disappointment , especially in light of the budget provided , the technical resources available , and the talent assembled . is n't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief . poa 2001 creates a plausible beginning , suckering us in , but thereinafter mr. burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains . the over the top libertarian of helena bonham carter 's chimp , the worthlessness of the humans ' lockup , the ease of their escape , their extraordinary skills of horsemanship ( this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt ) , the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable . mark wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear , danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down . compare to the original , in which chuck heston 's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events . the uniformed wahlberg preserves his modesty , but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation , and we never really wonder about his well being . unlike heston , he seems never to be in real jeopardy . tim burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting . in fact , after this inferior fiasco , i wonder why hollywood 's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats . let them walk . trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in planet of the apes 2001 . i 'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent . it could have been a new franchise , and a wonderful new step for imagination . another opportunity lost .
according to reviewers , the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school . jolly joke ! 1955 ? the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet , but there it is on the bandstand . the ford pony car was not invented yet , but there it is playing oldies music . the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970 's . the pony car at best is from the mid 1960 's . 20 year-old college kids ? josh brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-tv movie was produced . the plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their tv 's .
richard farnsworth is one of my favorite actors . he usually gives solid performances , such as in the straight story , and the grey fox . he also does fairly well here , but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget , poor writing , and so-so photography . the miller-movie formula gives it a 4 . richard gets a 5 .
my comments may be a bit of a spoiler , for what it 's worth . stop now if you care enough .... saving grace should have been titled `` a paper-thin excuse for old british women to get high on-screen . '' this film is dumb . the incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious , hackneyed tunes that sporadically pop up to comment on the narrative ( `` spirit in the sky , '' for example - oh , i get it ! ) this is basically a cheech and chong movie made credible by its stodgy english setting and brenda blethyn 's overwhelming power to inflict emotion on an audience using her voice alone . i could literally hear the folks over at high times magazine receiving their jollies over the enormous `` buds '' that litter this picture . worst scene ? easy . brenda attempts to peddle her illicit wares on the street of london in a blaring white dress-suit . not funny . not original . not interesting . not a good movie . the 7.2 rating is the result of zealots over-voting . do n't waste your time ...
the `` saucy '' misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in london on the same day in the early 1970s . there 's a swedish girl , a danish , a german and a chinese . the story contrives to get the clothes off all of them , involve them in some carry on-type humour and couple them with various misfits from the british film and tv culture of the time , including man about the house star richard o'sullivan , future coronation street rogue johnny briggs and horror film stalwart ferdy mayne ( playing a sheik ) . there 's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display , for those who like that kind of thing ( but obviously nothing hardcore ) . most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential ; the girls are stereotypes , and german anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she 's a moron obsessed with colour tv who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts ; in another more serious film , she would be a psychiatric case . the most interesting section of the film involves the swedish girl being taken to a club in london where some dodgy types are still trying to swing , being seduced by a middle-aged rocker , losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her . these sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we 've ended up with , in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives ( there 's a fine turn by john standing as an impotent public school roué ) . the strangest of the stories has the chinese girl ( future cannibal film veteran me me lay ) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer , falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all , except some orientalist notion that `` chinese birds are inscrutable , ai n't they ? ! '' the film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there 's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations . the end is striking , as mayne 's sheik for no earthly reason ( except they have to end the film somehow ) whisks all of the girls away to his arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade , which they are all delighted about . stuff and nonsense for the most part then , but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran val guest , which puts it as a piece of film-making a notch above most of the 70s brit sexploitation flicks .
oh , those italians ! assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes , castles drowned in gothic atmosphere , and back-stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all ! if you 've seen one film of this type , you 've basically seen them all ( the mst3k favorite `` screaming skull '' fits the mold , too ) ... and `` the night evelyn came out of the grave '' is formulaic , by-the-numbers , and dull as hell . even the luscious erika blanc is put to waste here . zero/10
eight academy nominations ? it 's beyond belief . i can only think it was a very bad year - even by hollywood standards . with huston as director and jack nicholson and kathleen turner as leads i probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway , but the oscar nominations really sold it to me , and i feel distinctly cheated as a result . so it 's a black comedy is it ? can anyone tell me where the humour is in prizzi 's honor ? it 's certainly tasteless ( the shooting in the head of a policeman 's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life ) but with the exception of a joke about 'your favourite mexican cigars ' ( which i imagine is an old joke for americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything cuban for the last 50 years ) i failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and i did try . there is a lot of mafia cliché but cliché does n't constitute humour in my book . is it a romantic comedy of sorts ? never . the characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with ben afleck and jennifer lopez in gigli . is it a cleverly devised parody about the mafia ? not in a million years . the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd , and it usually just has the feel of a really bad ( and cheap ) mafia movie . it feels more like a homage than a parody . with one-dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them , the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces . well it is n't enough ; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression , jack nicholson ( repleat with puffed up top lip ... now is that meant to be a parody of brando 's padded jowls in the godfather ? ... oh ! who cares ? ... all i know is , it is n't funny ) . throw in some slow , plodding direction ( this film drags on for 2 hours ) , some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as ; `` you remember the camora ? well we 're far bigger , we 'll track you down wherever you go '' , and clichéd mannerisms and you 'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say `` capiche ? '' . prizzi 's honor is far from being huston 's `` masterpiece '' and is rather a very poor last work . it 's definitely one work in the great director 's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the hudson river .
not that i dislike childrens movies , but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities . m.j. fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted . hugh laurie can be amazingly funny , but is not given the chance in this movie . it´s sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age . see toy story , monsters inc. or shrek instead . 3/10
